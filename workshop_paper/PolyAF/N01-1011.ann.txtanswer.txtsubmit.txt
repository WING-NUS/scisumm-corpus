This is quite similar to the bagged decision trees of bigrams (B) presented here, except that the earlier work learns a single decision tree where training examples are represented by the top 100 ranked bigrams, according to the loglikelihood ratio. This earlier approach was evaluated on the SENSEVAL -1 data and achieved an overall accuracy of 64% | Reference Offset: ['25066-25126', '25766-25815'] | Reference Text:  of candidate features presented to the decision tree learner...functionally equivalent to our benchmark methods. | Discourse Facet: Method_Citation |  Annotator:  a |
