1) character encoding issues for XML Reference files that are not all UTF-8

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) PDF-to-text conversion issues and consequent sentence segmentation in the reference papers, for instance:
> Example: scisumm-corpus-master/data/C94-2154_TRAIN/Reference_XML/C94-2154.xml
<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">In this pal)er, we will first in ยง2 survey the range of type eonstra.ints tha.t ma.y be expressed with just a. type hiera.rchy and *&apos;]&apos;he resea.rch pl&apos;eS(!lllL(&apos;d ill |,his; paper was pay tia.lly sponsored hy &apos;[kfilprojekt B4 &quot;(;onsl.rahH.s on Grammar fl~r Efficient Ck:neration&quot; of the Soi,der forschungsbereich 340 of the Deutsche [&quot;orschungsgemeinscha, ft. &quot;VVe would also like to thank &apos;l&apos;hilo GStz for helph,l comments ou thc ideas present.ed here.</S>

> Example 2: scisumm-corpus-master/data/N01-1011_TRAIN/Reference_XML/N01-1011.xml
<S sid ="121" ssid = "9">Finally, column 13 shows the accuracy of the Naive Bayesian classi?er based on a bag of words feature set.</S>
Among others, the pairs of characters 'fi' and 'ff' are not properly converted into text.

3) XML formatting / not well-formed:
> scisumm-corpus-master/data/C90-2039_TRAIN/Reference_XML/C90-2039.xml
<SECTION title="Acknowledgement"> Element not closed,

4) Citing text parsing: we tried to retrieve from the annotation files (with columns separated by the character |) the citing text since it is not possible to retrieve from the offset of the citing article text. Many times in the citing text column of the annotation files there are '...' that make it difficult to correctly identify the citing span, for instance:



_______________________________________
We found some issue that prevent us from correctly parse the dataset:
text encoding: as stated by the instructions texts should be in UTF-8 format. In different text files we had problems with non UTF-8 encodings and we run the https://code.google.com/p/juniversalchardet/ jar tool over all the text and annotations in order to determine the right file encoding to use. I'm not sure about the accurancy of the results of this library, but it seems that there are files in UTF-8, WINDOWS-1252 and GB18030. A detailed list of the encoding of each file is presente at the end of this email. Please, could you help us with this issue?
annotation offsets: we experienced some issues with annotation offsets. For instance if ve consider the training document set: C94-2154_TRAIN and its Citance Number: 1, from the file C94-2154.ann.txt, we can understand that it is a citation of the article Citing Article:  E95-1024-parscit-section.txt and the citation offset in the citing paper is 21506-21601. If we open the citing paper E95-1024.txt (we have to remove manually parsecit-section from the paper name), we annotate the last row of section 3.2 and the title of section 4.
annotation ID missing: several annotation texts have no annotation id (Citance Number field). We could generate random IDs.
other annotation file parsing issues:

Please, could you give us instruction on how to fix these issues?
