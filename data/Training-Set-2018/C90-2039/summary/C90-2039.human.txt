The strategic lazy incremental copy graph (SLING) unification method combines two incremental copy graph unification method - the lazy incremental copy graph (LING) unification and the strategic incremental copy graph (SING) unification method. The LING unification method achieves structure sharing which avoids memory wastage and increases the portion of token identical substructures of FSs. The SING unification method introduces the feature unification strategy and lists the factors on which it’s efficiency depends. The combined method increases the total efficiency of FS unification-based natural language processing systems.
