The paper aims at describing refinements that are currently being investigated in a model for part-ofspeech
assignment to words in unrestricted text. The model has the advantage that a pre-tagged
training corpus is not required. The determination of part-of-speech categories for words is an
important problem in language modelling, because both the syntactic and semantic roles of words
depend on their part-of-speech category. The statistical methods can be described in terms of Markov
models. States in a model represent categories. In Hidden Markov model, the Baum-Welch algorithm
can be used to estimate the model parameters. This has the great advantage of eliminating the pretagged
corpus. It minimizes the resources required, facilitates experimentation with different word
categories, and is easily adapted for use with other languages. One aim of the work is to investigate
the quality and performance of models with minimal parameter descriptions. Many Lisp-specific word
categories were created for frequently occurring Lisp symbols in an attempt to reduce bias in the
estimation. A stochastic method for assigning part-of-speech categories to unrestricted English text
has been described. It minimizes the resources required for high performance automatic tagging.
