A Fast Fertility Hidden Markov Model forWord Alignment Using MCMC A word in one language can be translated to zero, one, or several words in other languages. Using word fertility features has been shown to be useful in building word alignment models for statistical machine translation. We built a fertility hidden Markov model by adding fertility to the hidden Markov model. This model not only achieves lower alignment error rate than the hidden Markov model, but also runs faster. It is similar in some ways to IBM Model 4, but is much easier to understand. We use Gibbs sampling for parameter estimation, which is more principled than the neighborhood method used in IBM Model 4.
