Quasi-synchronous grammar makes no restrictions on the form of the target monolingual grammar, though dependency grammars have been used in most previous applications of QG (Wang et al., 2007; Das and Smith, 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009), including previous work in MT (Smith and Eisner, 2006; Gimpel and Smith, 2009).</S> |

We follow Gimpel and Smith (2009) in constructing a lattice to represent Gs,s and using lattice parsing to search for the best derivation, but we construct the lattice differently and employ a coarse-to- fine strategy (Petrov, 2009) to speed up decoding.</S> |
