Improved Word-Level System Combination for Machine Translation Recently, confusion network decoding has been applied in machine translation system combination. Due to errors in the hypothesis alignment, decoding may result in ungrammatical combination outputs. This paper describes an improved confusion network based method to combine outputs from multiple MT systems. In this approach, arbitrary features may be added log-linearly into the objective function, thus allowing language model expansion and re-scoring. Also, a novel method to automatically select the hypothesis which other hypotheses are aligned against is proposed. A generic weight tuning algorithm may be used to optimize various automatic evaluation metrics including TER, BLEU and METEOR. The experiments using the 2005 Arabic to English and Chinese to English NIST MT evaluation tasks show significant improvements in BLEU scores compared to earlier confusion network decoding based methods.
