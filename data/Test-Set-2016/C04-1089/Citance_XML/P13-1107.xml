			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">In this paper, we focus on one particular language evolution that creates new ways to communicate sensitive subjects because of the existence of internet information censorship.</S>

			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">For example, when Chinese online users talk about the former politician “Bo Xilai”, they use a morph “Peace West King” instead, a historical figure four hundreds years ago who governed the same region as Bo.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Morph can be considered as a special case of alias used for hiding true entities in malicious environment (Hsiung et al., 2005; Pantel, 2006).</S>

			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Usually morphs are generated by harvesting the collective wisdom of the crowd to achieve certain communication goals.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Aside from the purpose of avoiding censorship, other motivations for using morph include expressing sarcasm/irony, positive/negative sentiment or making descriptions more vivid toward some entities or events.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Table 1 presents the wide range of cases that are used to create the morphs.</S>

			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">First, the sensitive real targets that exist in the same data source under active censorship are often automatically filtered.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Table 2 presents the distributions of some examples of morphs and their targets in English Twitter and Chinese Sina Weibo.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">For example, the target “Chen Guangcheng” only appears once in Weibo.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">Thus, the co-occurrence of a morph and its target is quite low in the vast amount of information in social media.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">Second, most morphs were not created based on pronunciations, spellings or other encryptions of their original targets.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Instead, they were created according to semantically related entities in historical and cultural narratives (e.g. “Peace West King” as morph of “Bo Xilai”) and thus very difficult to capture based on typical lexical features.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">Third, tweets from Twitter/Chinese Weibo are short (only up to the similarity measures to generate global semantic features.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">• We model social user behaviors and use social correlation to assist in measuring semantic similarities because the users who posted a morph and its corresponding target tend to share similar interests and opinions.</S>

			<S sid ="36" ssid = "4">• We detect target candidates by exploiting the dynamics of the social media to extract temporal distribution of entities, based on the assumption that the popularity of an individ ual is correlated between censored and uncensored text within a certain time window.</S>

			<S sid ="39" ssid = "7">Figure 1 depicts the general procedure of our approach.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "8">It consists of two main sub-tasks: • Target Candidate Identification: For each m, discover a list of target candidates E = {e1, e2, ..., eN }.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "9">First, relevant comparable data sets that include m are retrieved.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "10">In this paper we collect comparable censored data from Weibo and uncensored data from Twitter and Web documents such as news articles.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "11">We then apply various annotations such as word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase chunking, name tagging and event extraction to these data sets.</S>

	<SECTION title="Target Candidate Identification. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "1">The general goal of the first step is to identify a list of target candidates for each morph query from the comparable corpora including Sina Weibo, Chinese News websites and English Twitter.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "2">However, obviously we cannot consider all of the named entities in these sources as target candidates due to the sheer volume of information.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "3">In addition, morphs are not limited to named entity forms.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "4">In order to narrow down the scope of target candidates, we propose a Temporal Distribution Assumption as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "5">The intuition is that a morph m and its real target e should have similar temporal distributions in terms of their occurrences.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "6">Suppose the data sets are separated into Z temporal slots (e.g. by day), the assumption can 4.2 Semantic Features.</S>
			<SUBSECTION>4.2.1 Motivations Fortunately, although a morph and its target may have very different orthographic forms, they tend to be embedded in similar semantic contexts which involve similar topics and events.</SUBSECTION>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "7">Figure 2 presents some example messages under censorship (Weibo) and not under censorship (Twitter and Chinese Daily).</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "8">We can see that they include similar topics, events (e.g., “fell from power”, “gang crackdown”, “sing red songs”), and semantic relations (e.g., family relations with “Bo Guagua”).</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "9">Therefore if we can automatically extract and exploit these indicative semantic contexts, we can narrow down the real targets effectively.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "10"> Peace West King from Chongqing  Bo Xilai: ten thousand letters of accusation have been received during be stated as: fell from power, still need to sing red songs?</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "11">Chongqing gang crackdown.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "12"> There is no difference between that  The webpage of “Tianze Economic Let Tm = {tm1, tm2, ..., tmZm } be the set of temporal slots each morph m occurs, and Te ={te1, te2, ..., teZe } be the set of slots a target can didate e occurs.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "13">Then e is considered as a target candidate of m if and only if, for each tmi ∈ Tm (i = 1, 2, ..., Zm), there exist a j ∈ {1, 2, ..., Ze} guy’s plagiarism and Buhou’s gang crackdown.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "14"> Remember that Buhou said that his family was not rich at the press conference a few days before he fell from power.</S>

	<SECTION title="Target Candidate Ranking. " number = "4">
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "1">Next, we propose a learning-to-rank framework to rank target candidates based on various levels of novel features based on surface, semantic and social analysis.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "2">4.1 Surface Features.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "3">We first extract surface features between the morph and the candidate based on measuring orthographic similarity measures which were commonly used in entity coreference resolution (e.g.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "4">(Ng, 2010; Hsiung et al., 2005)).</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "5">The measures we use include “string edit distance”, “normalized string edit distance” (Wagner and Fischer, 1974) and “longest common subsequence” (Hirschberg, 1977).</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "6">Weibo (censored) Twitter and Chinese News (uncensored) Figure 2: Cross-source Comparable Data Example (each morph and target pair is shown in the same color) 4.2.2 Information Network Construction We define an information network as a directed graph G = (V, E ) with an object type mapping function τ : V → A and a link type mapping function φ : E → R, where each object v ∈ V belongs to one particular object type τ (v) ∈ A, each link e ∈ E belongs to a particular relation φ(e) ∈ R. If two links belong to the same relation type, then they share the same starting object type as well as the same ending object type.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "7">An information network is homogeneous if and only if there is only one type for both objects and links, and an information network is heterogeneous when the objects are from multiple distinct types or there exist more than one type of links.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "8">In order to construct the information networks for morphs, we apply the Standford Chinese word segmenter with Chinese Penn Treebank segmentation standard (Chang et al., 2008) and Stanford part-of-speech tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) to process each sentence in the comparable data sets.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "9">Then we apply a hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based Chinese lexical analyzer ICTCLAS (Zhang et al., 2003) to extract named entities, noun phrases and events.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "10">We have also attempted using the results from Dependency Parsing, Relation Extraction and Event Extraction tools (Ji and Grishman, 2008) Buhou Morph Peace West King Morph Bo Guagua Entity Chongqing Entity Gang Crackdown Event Fell From Power Event Sing Red Songs Event Bo Xilai Entity to enrich the link types.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "11">Unfortunately the state- of-the-art techniques for these tasks still perform poorly on social media in terms of both accuracy and coverage of important information, these sophisticated semantic links all produced negative impact on the target ranking performance.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "12">Therefore we limited the types of vertices into: Morph (M), Entity(E), which includes target candidates, Event (EV), and NonEntity Noun Phrases (NP); and used co-occurrence as the edge type.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "13">We extract entities, events, and nonentity noun phrases that occur in more than one tweet as neighbors.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "14">And for two vertices xi and xj , the weight wij of their edge is the frequency they co-occur together within the tweets.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "15">A network schema of such networks is shown in Figure 3.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "16">Figure 4 M E EV NP Figure 3: Network Schema of Morph-Related Heterogeneous Information Network presents an example of a heterogeneous information network from the motivation examples following the above network schema, which connects the morphs “Peace West King”, “Buhou” and their corresponding target “Bo Xilai”.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "17">4.2.3 Meta-Path-Based Semantic Similarity Measurements Given the constructed network, a straightforward solution for finding the target for a morph is to use link-based similarity search.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "18">However, now objects are linked to different types of neighbors, if all neighbors are treated as the same, it may cause information loss problems.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "19">For example, the en tity “重庆 (Chongqing)” is a very important aspect Figure 4: Example of Morph-Related Heterogeneous Information Network since he governed it, and if a morph m which is also highly correlated with “重庆 (Chongqing)”, it is very likely that “Bo Xilai” is the real target of m. Therefore, the semantic features generated from neighbors such as the entity “重庆 (Chongqing)” should be treated differently from other types of neighbors such as “人才(talented people)” . In this work, we propose to measure the similarity of two nodes over heterogeneous networks as shown in Figure 3, by distinguishing neighbors into three types according to the network schema (i.e. entities, events, nonentity noun phrases).</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "20">We then adopt meta-path-based similarity measures (Sun et al., 2011a; Sun et al., 2011b), which are defined over heterogeneous networks to extract semantic features.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "21">A meta-path is a path defined over a network, and composed of a sequence of relations between different object types.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "22">For example, as shown in Figure 3, a morph and its target candidate can be connected by three meta-paths, including “ME - E”, “MEV - E”, and “M - NP - E”.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "23">Intuitively, each meta-path provides a unique angle to measure how similar two objects are.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "24">For the determined meta-paths, we extract semantic features using the similarity measures proposed in (Sun et al., 2011a; Hsiung et al., 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "25">We denote the neighbor sets of certain type for a morph m and a target candidate e as Γ(m) and Γ(e), and a meta-path as P. We now list several meta-path-based similarity measures below.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "26">Common neighbors (CN).</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "27">It measures the number of common neighbors that m and e share as |Γ(m) ∩ Γ(e)|.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "28">Path count (PC).</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "29">It measures the number of path instances between m and e following meta-path P.Pairwise random walk (PRW).</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "30">For a meta meta-paths with the same length P = (P1P2),pairwise random walk measures the probabil ity of the pairwise random walk starting from both m and e and reaching the same middle object.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "31">More formally, it is computed as into similarity measures to generate global semantic features.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "32">Let T = t1 ∪ t2 ∪ ... ∪ tN be a set of temporal slots (i.e. by day), E be the set of target candidates for each morph m. Then for each ti ∈ T , and each −1 −1 (p1 p2 )∈(P1 P2 ) prob(p1)prob(p2 ), where p2 is the inverse of p2.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "33">KullbackLeibler distance (KLD).</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "34">For m and e, the pairwise random walk probability of their neighbors can be represented as two probability vectors, then KullbackLeibler distance (Hsiung et al., 2005) can be used to compute sim(m, e).</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "35">Beyond the above similarity measures, we also propose to use cosine-similarity-style normalization method to modify common neighbor and pair e ∈ E, the local semantic features simti (m, e) is extracted based only on the information posted within ti using one of the similarity measures introduced in Section 4.2.3.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "36">Then we propose two approaches to generate global semantic features.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "37">The first approach is adding the similarity score between m and e in each temporal slot to attain the first set of global features: simglobal sum(m, e) = ) simt wise random walk measures so that we can ensure ti ∈T i (m, e).</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "38">the morph node and the target candidate node are strongly connected and also have similar popularity.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "39">The modified algorithms penalize features involved with the highly popular objects, since they are more likely to have accidental interactions with each other.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "40">The second method first normalizes the similarity score in each temporal slot ti, them sum the normalized scores to generate the second set of global features, which can be calculated as simglobal norm(m, e) = ) normt (m, e).Normalized common neighbors (NCN).</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "41">Nor malized common neighbors can be measured as ti ∈T sim(m, e) = √|Γ(m)∩Γ(e)| . It refines the simple.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "42">where normt (m, e) = si mti (m,e) . |Γ(m)|√|Γ(e)| i e∈E simti (m,e) counting of common neighbors by avoiding bias to highly visible or concentrated objects.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "43">Pairwise random walk/cosine (PRW/cosine).</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "44">Pairwise random walk measures linkage weights disproportionately with their visibility to their neighbors, which may be too strong.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "45">Instead, we propose to use a tamer normalization method as 4.2.5 Integrate Cross Source/Cross Genre Information Due to internet information censorship or surveillance, users may need to use morphs to post sensitive information.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "46">For example, the Chinese Weibo message “都 进 去 了,还 要 贡 着 不 厚 吗 (Already (p1 p2 )∈(P1 P2 ) f (p1)f (p2 ), where.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "47">count(m, x) put in prison, still need to serve Buhou?” include a morph 不厚 (Buhou).</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "48">In contrast, users are less restricted in some other uncensored social media f (p1) = f (p2) = , x∈Ω count(m, x) count(e, x) , x∈Ω count(e, x) such as Twitter.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "49">For example, the tweet from Twitter “...把 薄 熙 来 称 作“平 西 王”或 者“不 厚”...</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "50">(...call Bo Xilai“peace west king” or “buhou”...)” contains both the morph and the real target 薄熙 and Ω is the set of middle objects connecting the decomposed meta-paths p1 and p−1, count(y, x) is the total number of paths between y and the middle object x, y could be m or e. The above similarity measures can also be applied to homogeneous networks that do not differentiate the neighbor types.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "51">4.2.4 Global Semantic Feafure Generation A morph tends to have higher temporal correlation with its real target, and share more similar topics compared to other irrelevant targets.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "52">Therefore, we propose to incorporate temporal information 来 (Bo Xilai).</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "53">Therefore, we propose to integrate information from another source (e.g. Twitter) to help resolution of sensitive morphs in Weibo.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "54">Another difficulty from morph resolution in micro-blogging is that tweets are only allowed to contain maximum 140 characters with a lot of noise and diverse topics.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "55">The shortness and diversity of tweets may limit the power of content analysis for semantic feature extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "56">However, formal genres such as web documents are cleaner and contain richer contexts, thus can provide more topically related information.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "57">In this work, we also exploit the background web documents from the embedded URLs in tweets to enrich information network construction.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "58">After applying the same annotation techniques as tweets for uncensored data sets, sentence-level co-occurrence relations are extracted and integrated into the network as shown in Figure 3.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "59">4.3 Social Features.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "60">It has been shown that there exist correlation between neighbors in social networks (Anagnostopoulos et al., 2008; Wen and Lin, 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "61">Because of such social correlation, close social neighbors in social media such as Twitter and Weibo may post similar information, or share similar opinion.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "62">Therefore, we can utilize social correlation to assist in resolving morphs.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "63">As social correlation can be defined as a function of social distance between a pair of users, we use social distance as a proxy to social correlation in our approach.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "64">The social distance between user i and j is defined by considering the degree of separation in their interaction (e.g. retweeting and mentioning) and the amount of the interaction.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "65">Similar definition has been shown effective in characterizing social distance in social networks extracted from communication data (Lin et al., 2012; Wen and Lin, 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "66">Specifically, it is dist(i, j) = K −1 1 , where 4.4 Learning-to-Rank.</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "67">Similar to (Hsiung et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2011a), we then model the probability of linkage prediction between a morph m and its target candidate e as a function incorporating the surface, semantic and social features.</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "68">Given a training pair (m, e), we choose the standard logistic regression model to learn weights for the features defined above.</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "69">The learnt model is used to predict the probability of linking an unseen morph and its target candidate.</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "70">Based on the descending ranking order of the probability, we select top k candidates as the final answers based on the answer size k.</S>

			<S sid ="153" ssid = "17">5.2.1 Single Genre Information We first study the contributions of each set of surface and semantic features, as shown in the first five rows in Table 4.</S>
			<S sid ="154" ssid = "18">The poor performance based on surface features shows that morph resolution task is very challenging since 70% of morphs are not orthographically similar to their real targets.</S>
			<S sid ="155" ssid = "19">Thus, capturing a morph’s semantic meaning is crucial.</S>
			<S sid ="156" ssid = "20">Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</S>
			<S sid ="157" ssid = "21">Specifically, comparing “HomB” and “HetB”, “HomE” and “HetE”, we can see that the semantic features based on heterogeneous networks have advantages over those based on homogeneous networks.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "22">This corroborates that different neighbor sets contribute differently, and such discrepancies should be captured.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "23">And comparisions of “HomB” and “HomE”, “HetB” and “HetE”demonstrate the effectiveness of our two new proposed measures.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "24">To evaluate the importance of each similarity measures, we delete the semantic features obtained from each measure in “HetE” and reevaluate the system.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "25">We find that NCN is the most effective measure, while KLD is the least important one.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "26">Further adding the global semantic features significantly improves the performance.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "27">This indicates that capturing both temporal correlations and semantics of morphing simultaneously are important for morph resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "28">Table 5 shows that combination of surface and semantic features further improves the performance, showing that they are complementary.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "29">For example, using only surface features, the real tar get “乔布斯 （Steve Jobs）” of the morph “乔帮 主 (Qiao Boss)” is not top ranked since some othercandidates such as “乔治 (George)” are more or thographically similar.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "30">However, “Steve Jobs” is ranked top when combined with semantic features.</S>

			<S sid ="171" ssid = "35">Notice that integrating tweets from Twitter mainly improves the ranking for top k where k &gt; 1.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "36">This is because Weibo dominates our dataset, and in Weibo many of these sensitive morphs are mostly used with their traditional meanings instead of the morph senses.</S>

			<S sid ="180" ssid = "44">5.2.3 Effects of Social Features Table 7 shows that adding social features can improve the best performance achieved so far.</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "45">This is because a group of people with close relationships may share similar opinion.</S>
			<S sid ="182" ssid = "46">As an example, two tweets “...of course the reputation of Buhou is a little too high!</S>

			<S sid ="184" ssid = "48">are from two users in the same social group.One includes a morph “Buhou” and the other includes its target “Bo Xilai”.</S>
			<S sid ="185" ssid = "49">Table 8: The Effects of Temporal Constraint We also attempted using topic modeling approach to detect target candidates.</S>
			<S sid ="186" ssid = "50">Due to the large amount of data, we first split the data set on a daily basis, then applied Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="187" ssid = "51">Named entities which co-occur at least δ times with a morph query in the same topic are selected as its target candidates.</S>
			<S sid ="188" ssid = "52">As shown in Table9 (K is the number of predefined topics), PLSA is not quite effective mainly because traditional topic modeling approaches do not perform well on short texts from social media.</S>
			<S sid ="189" ssid = "53">Therefore, in this paper we choose a simple method based on temporal distribution to detect target candidates.</S>
			<S sid ="190" ssid = "54">Table 9: Accuracy of Target Candidate Detection Table 7: The Effects of Social Features.</S>
			<S sid ="191" ssid = "55">5.3 Effects of Candidate Detection.</S>
			<S sid ="192" ssid = "56">The performance with and without candidate detection step (using all features) is shown in Table 8.</S>
			<S sid ="193" ssid = "57">The gain is small since the combination of all features in the learning to rank framework can already well capture the relationship between a morph and a target candidate.</S>
			<S sid ="194" ssid = "58">Nevertheless, the temporal distribution assumption is effective.</S>
			<S sid ="195" ssid = "59">It helps to filter out 80% of unrelated targets and 5.4 Discussions.</S>
			<S sid ="196" ssid = "60">Compared with the standard alias detection (“Surf+HomB”) approach (Hsiung et al., 2005), our proposed approach achieves significantly better performance (99.9% confidence level by the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test for Acc@1).</S>
			<S sid ="197" ssid = "61">We further explore two types of factors which may affect the system performance as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="198" ssid = "62">One important aspect affecting the resolution performance is the morph &amp; non-morph ambiguity.</S>
			<S sid ="199" ssid = "63">We categorize a morph query as “Unique” if the string is mainly used as a morph when it occurs, such as “薄督 (Bodu)” which is used to re fer to “Bo Xilai”; otherwise as “Common” (e.g. “宝 宝 (Baby)” ,“校 长 (President)” ).</S>
			<S sid ="200" ssid = "64">Table 10 presents the separate scores for these two categories.</S>
			<S sid ="201" ssid = "65">We can see that the morphs in “Unique” category have much better resolution performance than those in “Common” category.</S>
