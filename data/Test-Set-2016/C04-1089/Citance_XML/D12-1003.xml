			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Bilingual lexicons are important resources for bilingual tasks such as machine translation (MT) and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Therefore, the automatic building of bilingual lexicons from corpora is one of the issues that have attracted many researchers.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">As a solution, a number of previous works proposed extracting bilingual lexicons from comparable corpora, in which documents were not direct translations but shared a topic or domain1.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">The use of comparable corpora is motivated by the fact that large parallel corpora are only available for a few language pairs and for limited domains.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Most of the previous methods are based on assumption (I), that a word and its translation tend to appear in similar contexts across languages (Rapp, 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Based on this assumption, many methods calculate word similarity using context and then extract word translation pairs with a high-context similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">We call these methods context-similarity- based methods.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">The context similarities are usually computed using a seed bilingual lexicon (e.g. a general bilingual dictionary) by mapping contexts expressed in two different languages into the same space.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">In the mapping, information not represented by the seed lexicon is discarded.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Therefore, the context-similarity-based methods could not find accurate translation pairs if using a small seed lexicon.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Some of the previous methods tried to alleviate the problem of the limited seed lexicon size (Koehn and Knight, 2002; Morin and Prochasson, 2011; Hazem et al., 2011), while others did not require any seed lexicon (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1995; Haghighi et al., 2008; Ismail and Manandhar, 2010; Daume´ III and Jagarlamudi, 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">However, they suffer the problems of high computational cost (Rapp, 1995), sensitivity to parameters (Hazem et al., 2011), low accuracy (Fung, 1995; Ismail and Manandhar, 2010), and ineffectiveness for language pairs with 1 Although Vulic´ et al.</S>

			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">In face of the above problems, we propose a novel method that uses a graph-based label propagation technique (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">The proposed method is based on assumption (II), which is derived by recursively applying assumption (I) to the “contexts”: a word and its translation tend to have similar co-occurrence (direct and indirect) relations with all bilingual seeds across languages.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Based on assumption (II), we propose a three- step approach: (1) constructing a graph for each language with each edge indicating a direct co- occurrence relation, (2) representing every word as a seed translation distribution by iteratively propagating translated seeds in each graph, (3) finding two words in different languages with a high similarity with respect to the seed distributions.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">By propagating all the seeds on the graph, indirect co-occurrence relations are also considered when computing bilingual relations, which have been neglected in previous methods.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">In addition to the co-occurrence-based graph construction, we propose a similarity graph, which also takes into account context similarities between words.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">The main contributions of this paper are as follows: • We propose a bilingual lexicon extraction method that captures co-occurrence relations with all the seeds, including indirect relations, using graph-based label propagation.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">In our experiments, we confirm that the proposed method outperforms conventional context-similarity-based methods (Rapp, 1999; Andrade et al., 2010), and works well even if the coverage of a seed lexicon is low.</S>

			<S sid ="100" ssid = "17">To obtain co-occurrence relations with all the seeds, including indirect relations, we focus on a graph-based label propagation (LP) technique (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002).</S>

			<S sid ="113" ssid = "30">Each edge in the graph indicates correlation strength between occurrences of two linked words.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "31">An example is shown in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "32">In edge weight calculation, the co-occurrence frequencies are first computed for each word pair in the same context, and then the correlation strength is estimated.</S>

			<S sid ="126" ssid = "43">Thus, we propose a similarity graph where context similarities are employed as weights of edges instead of simple co-occurrence-based correlations.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "44">Since the context similarities are computed by the global correlation among words which co-occur, a similarity graph is less subject to accidental co-occurrence.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "45">The use of a similarity graph is inspired by assumption (III): a word and its translation tend to have similar context similarities with all bilingual seeds across languages5.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "46">In edge weight calculation, we first construct a LP is a graph-based technique which transfers the labels from labeled data to unlabeled data in order to infer labels for unlabeled data.</S>

			<S sid ="131" ssid = "48">LP has been successfully applied in common natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Niu et al., 2005; Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007), multi-class lexicon acquisition (Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007), and part-of-speech tagging (Das and Petrov, 2011).</S>

			<S sid ="139" ssid = "56">There are various similarity measures that can be used, and cosine similarity is used in this 5 This assumption is justified because context similarities are based on co-occurrence relations that are preserved across different languages.</S>

			<S sid ="143" ssid = "60">In Figure 1, the balloons attached to vertices in the graphs show examples of the seed distributions generated by propagations.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "61">For example, the English word “piranha” has the seed distribution where the weights of the seeds “Amazon”, “jungle”, and “fish” are 0.5, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively.</S>

			<S sid ="148" ssid = "65">After label propagations, we treat a pair of words in different languages with similar seed distributions as a translation pair.</S>
			<S sid ="149" ssid = "66">Seed distribution can be regarded as a vector where each dimension corresponds to each translated seed and each dimension has updated weight through label propagations.</S>
			<S sid ="150" ssid = "67">A similarity between seed distributions can therefore be calculated in the same way as a context-similarity- based method.</S>
			<S sid ="151" ssid = "68">In this paper, we use the cosine similarity defined by the following: a number of technical terms and neologisms.</S>

			<S sid ="213" ssid = "2">Table 3 shows a list of the top 5 translation candidates for the Japanese word “躁 鬱 病 (manic depression)” for each method, where the ranks of the correct translations are shown in parentheses next to method names.</S>
			<S sid ="214" ssid = "3">Table 4 shows the top 5 translated seeds which characterize the query, where the values in parentheses indicate weight.</S>
			<S sid ="215" ssid = "4">Table 3 shows that C ooc(L) can find the correct translation equivalent but Andrade(L) cannot.</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "5">Table 4 shows that C ooc(L) can utilize more seeds closely tied to thequery (e.g. “神経症 (neurosis)”, “不眠症 (insom nia)”), which did not occur in the context of the query in the experiment data.</S>
			<S sid ="217" ssid = "6">The result shows that indirectly-related seeds are also important clues, and our proposed method can utilize these.</S>
			<S sid ="218" ssid = "7">5.2 Impact of Seed Lexicon Size.</S>
			<S sid ="219" ssid = "8">Table 2 shows that a reduction of seed lexicon size degrades performance.</S>
			<S sid ="220" ssid = "9">This is natural for the base line methods because LexS cannot translate most ofcontext words, which are necessary for word charac terization.</S>
			<S sid ="221" ssid = "10">Consider Andrade(L) and Andrade(S ) in the example in Section 5.1.</S>
			<S sid ="222" ssid = "11">Table 4 shows that Andrade(S ) uses less relevant seeds with the query,and has to express the query by seeds with less association.</S>
			<S sid ="223" ssid = "12">For example, “精神病 (psychosis)” can not be used in Andrade(S ) because LexS does not have the seed.</S>
			<S sid ="224" ssid = "13">Therefore, it is more difficult for Andrade(S ) to find correct translation pairs.The proposed methods also share the same ten dency, although each word is expressed by all the seeds in the seed lexicon.</S>
			<S sid ="225" ssid = "14">Consider C ooc(L) and C ooc(S ) in the above example.</S>
			<S sid ="226" ssid = "15">Table 4 shows that C ooc(S ) expresses the query by a smooth seed distribution, which is difficult to discriminate from oth ers.</S>
			<S sid ="227" ssid = "16">This is because LexS does not have relevant seeds for the query.</S>
			<S sid ="228" ssid = "17">This is why C ooc(S ) cannot find the correct translation equivalent.</S>
			<S sid ="229" ssid = "18">On the otherhand, C ooc(L) characterizes “躁鬱病” and “manic depression” by strongly relevant seeds (e.g. “精神 病 (psychosis)”,“神経症 (neurosis)”), and then finds the correct translation equivalent.</S>
			<S sid ="230" ssid = "19">To examine the robustness-to-seed lexicon size, we calculated the reduction rate of Acc20 with the following expression: (Acc20 with LexL − Acc20 with LexS ) / Acc20 with LexL . The reduction rates of Rapp, Andrade, C ooc, and S im are 78.4%, 76.1%, 69.6%, and 62.4% respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="231" ssid = "20">Moreover, the difference between degradation in C ooc and that in Andrade is statistically significant in the sign-test with 1% significance-level.</S>
			<S sid ="232" ssid = "21">These results indicate that the proposed methods are more robust to seed lexicon size than the baselines.</S>
			<S sid ="233" ssid = "22">This is because the proposed methods can utilize seeds with indirect relations while the baselines utilize only seeds in the context.</S>
			<S sid ="234" ssid = "23">To verify our claim, we examined the number of test words which occurred with no seeds in the context.</S>

			<S sid ="248" ssid = "37">On the other hand, the proposed methods are able to utilize all the seeds in order to find equivalents for words such as these.</S>
			<S sid ="249" ssid = "38">Therefore, the proposed methods work well even if the coverage of a seed lexicon is low.</S>
			<S sid ="250" ssid = "39">5.3 Impact of Word Frequencies.</S>
			<S sid ="251" ssid = "40">Our test data includes many low-frequency words which are not covered by the EDR bilingual dictionary or the NTCIR parallel data.</S>
			<S sid ="252" ssid = "41">624 words appear in the corpus less than 50 times.</S>
			<S sid ="253" ssid = "42">Table 5 shows AccN using LexL for 624 low-frequency words and376 high-frequency words.</S>
			<S sid ="254" ssid = "43">Table 5 shows that per formance for low-frequency words is much worse than that for high-frequency words.</S>
			<S sid ="255" ssid = "44">This is because translation of high-frequency words utilizes abundant and reliable context information, while the context information for low-frequency words is statistically unreliable.</S>
			<S sid ="256" ssid = "45">In the proposed methods, edges linking rare words are sometimes generated based on accidental co-occurrences, and then unrelated seed information is transferred through the edges.</S>
			<S sid ="257" ssid = "46">Therefore, even our label propagation based meth ods, especially for C ooc, could not identify the correct translation equivalents for rare words.</S>
			<S sid ="258" ssid = "47">S im al leviated the problem by using a similarity graph in which edges are generated based on global correlation among words, as indicated by Table 5.</S>
			<S sid ="259" ssid = "48">Table 5 also suggests that top 20 translation candidates for high-frequency words have potential to contribute to bilingual tasks such as MT and CLIR although the overall performance is still low.</S>
			<S sid ="260" ssid = "49">5.4 Effect of Similarity Graphs.</S>
			<S sid ="261" ssid = "50">We examined AccN for synonyms of translated seeds in Japanese.</S>
			<S sid ="262" ssid = "51">The Acc1 and Acc20 of S im(L) are 15.6% and 56.3%, respectively, and those of C ooc(L) are 9.4% and 37.5%, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="263" ssid = "52">The results show that similarity graphs are effective forclustering synonyms into the same translation equiv alents.</S>
			<S sid ="264" ssid = "53">For example, S im(L) extracted the correct translation pair of the English word “iodine” and the Japanese word “イオディン”, a synonym of the translated seed “ヨウ素 (iodine)” in Japanese.</S>
			<S sid ="265" ssid = "54">This is because synonyms tend to be linked in the similarity graph and have similar seed distributions.</S>
			<S sid ="266" ssid = "55">On the other hand, in the co-occurrence graph, synonyms tend to be indirectly linked through mutual context words, so the seed distributions of the two could be far away from each other.</S>
			<S sid ="267" ssid = "56">There are in particular many loanwords in patent documents, which are spelled in different ways from person to person.</S>
			<S sid ="268" ssid = "57">For example, the loan word for the English word “user” is often written as “ユーザ”, but it is sometimes written as “ユーザー”, with an additional prolonged sound mark.</S>
			<S sid ="269" ssid = "58">Therefore, S im is particularly effective for the experiment data.</S>
			<S sid ="270" ssid = "59">5.5 Error Analysis.</S>
			<S sid ="271" ssid = "60">We discuss errors of the proposed methods except the errors for low-frequency words (see Section 5.3).</S>
			<S sid ="272" ssid = "61">Our test data includes words whose translation equivalents inherently cannot be found.</S>
			<S sid ="273" ssid = "62">The first of these types are words whose equivalent does not exist in the English corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="274" ssid = "63">This is an unavoidable problem for methods based on comparable corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="275" ssid = "64">The second one are words whose English equivalents are compound words.</S>
			<S sid ="276" ssid = "65">The Japanese morphological analyzer tends to group a compound word into a single word, while the English text analyzer does not perform a collocation of words divided by the delimiter space.</S>
			<S sid ="277" ssid = "66">For example, the sin gle Japanese word “掌紋” is equivalent to “palm pattern” or “palm print”, which is composed of two words.</S>
			<S sid ="278" ssid = "67">This case was counted as an error even though the proposed methods found the word “palm” as a equivalent of “掌紋”.</S>
			<S sid ="279" ssid = "68">A main reason of errors other than those above is word sense ambiguity, which is different in ev ery language.</S>
			<S sid ="280" ssid = "69">For example, the Japanese word “右” means “right” and “conservatism” in English.</S>
			<S sid ="281" ssid = "70">The proposed methods merge different senses by propagating seeds through these polysemous words in only one language side.</S>
			<S sid ="282" ssid = "71">This is why translation pairs could have wrong seed distributions and then the proposed methods could not identify correct translation pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="283" ssid = "72">We will leave this word sense disambiguation problem for future work.</S>

			<S sid ="284" ssid = "1">Besides the comparable corpora approach discussed in Section 2, many alternatives have been proposed for bilingual lexicon extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="285" ssid = "2">The first is a method that finds translation pairs in parallel corpora (Wu and Xia, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Och and Ney, 2003).</S>
			<S sid ="286" ssid = "3">However, large parallel corpora are only available for a few language pairs and for limited domains.</S>
			<S sid ="287" ssid = "4">Moreover, even the large parallel corpora are relatively smaller than comparable corpora.</S>

			<S sid ="290" ssid = "7">(2004) extracted translation pairs by mining web anchor texts and link structures.</S>
			<S sid ="291" ssid = "8">As an alternative, mixed-language web pages are exploited by first retrieving texts including both source and target languages from the web by using a search engine or simple rules, and then extracting translation pairs from the mixed-language texts utilizing various clues: Zhang and Vines (2004) used co- occurrence statistics, Cheng et al.</S>
			<S sid ="292" ssid = "9">(2004) used co- occurrences and context similarity information, and Huang et al.</S>
			<S sid ="293" ssid = "10">(2005) used phonetic, semantic and frequency-distance features.</S>

			<S sid ="295" ssid = "12">(2008) proposed a method for extracting parenthetically translated terms, where a word alignment algorithm is used for establishing the correspondences between in-parenthesis and pre-parenthesis words.</S>
			<S sid ="296" ssid = "13">However, those methods cannot find translation pairs when they are not connected with each other through link structures, or when they do not co-occur in the same text.</S>
			<S sid ="297" ssid = "14">Transliteration is a completely different way for bilingual lexicon acquisition, in which a word in one language is converted into another language using phonetic equivalence (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Karimi et al., 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="298" ssid = "15">Although machine transliteration works particularly well for proper names and loan words, it cannot be employed for phonetically dissimilar translations.</S>
			<S sid ="299" ssid = "16">All the methods mentioned above may potentially extract translation pairs more precisely than our comparable corpora approach when their underlying assumptions are satisfied.</S>
			<S sid ="300" ssid = "17">We might improve the performance of our method by augmenting a seed lexicon with translation pairs extracted using the above methods, as experimented with in Section 4, in which additional lexical entries are included from parallel data.</S>

			<S sid ="305" ssid = "5">We are planning to investigate the following open problems in future work: word sense disambiguation and translation of compound words as described in (Daille and Morin, 2005; Morin et al., 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="306" ssid = "6">In addition, indirect relations have also been used in other tasks, such as paraphrase acquisition from bilingual parallel corpora (Kok and Brockett, 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="307" ssid = "7">We will utilize their random walk approach or other graph-based techniques such as modified adsorption (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) for generating seed distributions.</S>
			<S sid ="308" ssid = "8">We are also planning an end-to- end evaluation, for instance, by employing the extracted bilingual lexicon into an MT system.</S>
