Abstract
We present a novel method for extract-
ing parallel sub-sentential fragments from
comparable, non-parallel bilingual cor-
pora. By analyzing potentially similar
sentence pairs using a signal processing-
inspired approach, we detect which seg-
ments of the source sentence are translated
into segments in the target sentence, and
which are not. This method enables us
to extract useful machine translation train-
ing data even from very non-parallel cor-
pora, which contain no parallel sentence
pairs. We evaluate the quality of the ex-
tracted data by showing that it improves
the performance of a state-of-the-art sta-
tistical machine translation system.
1 Introduction
Recently, there has been a surge of interest in
the automatic creation of parallel corpora. Sev-
eral researchers (Zhao and Vogel, 2002; Vogel,
2003; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Fung and Cheung,
2004a; Wu and Fung, 2005; Munteanu and Marcu,
2005) have shown how fairly good-quality parallel
sentence pairs can be automatically extracted from
comparable corpora, and used to improve the per-
formance of machine translation (MT) systems.
This work addresses a major bottleneck in the de-
velopment of Statistical MT (SMT) systems: the
lack of sufficiently large parallel corpora for most
language pairs. Since comparable corpora exist in
large quantities and for many languages ? tens of
thousands of words of news describing the same
events are produced daily ? the ability to exploit
them for parallel data acquisition is highly benefi-
cial for the SMT field.
Comparable corpora exhibit various degrees of
parallelism. Fung and Cheung (2004a) describe
corpora ranging from noisy parallel, to compara-
ble, and finally to very non-parallel. Corpora from
the last category contain ?... disparate, very non-
parallel bilingual documents that could either be
on the same topic (on-topic) or not?. This is the
kind of corpora that we are interested to exploit in
the context of this paper.
Existing methods for exploiting comparable
corpora look for parallel data at the sentence level.
However, we believe that very non-parallel cor-
pora have none or few good sentence pairs; most
of their parallel data exists at the sub-sentential
level. As an example, consider Figure 1, which
presents two news articles from the English and
Romanian editions of the BBC. The articles re-
port on the same event (the one-year anniversary
of Ukraine?s Orange Revolution), have been pub-
lished within 25 minutes of each other, and express
overlapping content.
Although they are ?on-topic?, these two docu-
ments are non-parallel. In particular, they contain
no parallel sentence pairs; methods designed to ex-
tract full parallel sentences will not find any use-
ful data in them. Still, as the lines and boxes from
the figure show, some parallel fragments of data
do exist; but they are present at the sub-sentential
level.
In this paper, we present a method for extracting
such parallel fragments from comparable corpora.
Figure 2 illustrates our goals. It shows two sen-
tences belonging to the articles in Figure 1, and
highlights and connects their parallel fragments.
Although the sentences share some common
meaning, each of them has content which is not
translated on the other side. The English phrase
reports the BBC?s Helen Fawkes in Kiev, as well

as the Romanian one De altfel, vorbind inaintea
aniversarii have no translation correspondent, ei-
ther in the other sentence or anywhere in the whole
document. Since the sentence pair contains so
much untranslated text, it is unlikely that any par-
allel sentence detection method would consider it
useful. And, even if the sentences would be used
for MT training, considering the amount of noise
they contain, they might do more harm than good
for the system?s performance. The best way to
make use of this sentence pair is to extract and use
for training just the translated (highlighted) frag-
ments. This is the aim of our work.
Identifying parallel subsentential fragments is
a difficult task. It requires the ability to recog-
nize translational equivalence in very noisy en-
vironments, namely sentence pairs that express
different (although overlapping) content. How-
ever, a good solution to this problem would have a
strong impact on parallel data acquisition efforts.
Enabling the exploitation of corpora that do not
share parallel sentences would greatly increase the
amount of comparable data that can be used for
SMT.
2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential
Fragments in Comparable Corpora
2.1 Introduction
The high-level architecture of our parallel frag-
ment extraction system is presented in Figure 3.
The first step of the pipeline identifies docu-
ment pairs that are similar (and therefore more
likely to contain parallel data), using the Lemur
information retrieval toolkit1 (Ogilvie and Callan,
2001); each document in the source language is
translated word-for-word and turned into a query,
which is run against the collection of target lan-
guage documents. The top 20 results are retrieved
and paired with the query document. We then take
all sentence pairs from these document pairs and
run them through the second step in the pipeline,
the candidate selection filter. This step discards
pairs which have very few words that are trans-
lations of each other. To all remaining sentence
pairs we apply the fragment detection method (de-
scribed in Section 2.3), which produces the output
of the system.
We use two probabilistic lexicons, learned au-
1http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/$\sim$lemur
82
Figure 3: A Parallel Fragment Extraction System
tomatically from the same initial parallel corpus.
The first one, GIZA-Lex, is obtained by running
the GIZA++2 implementation of the IBM word
alignment models (Brown et al, 1993) on the ini-
tial parallel corpus. One of the characteristics of
this lexicon is that each source word is associated
with many possible translations. Although most of
its high-probability entries are good translations,
there are a lot of entries (of non-negligible proba-
bility) where the two words are at most related. As
an example, in our GIZA-Lex lexicon, each source
word has an average of 12 possible translations.
This characteristic is useful for the first two stages
of the extraction pipeline, which are not intended
to be very precise. Their purpose is to accept most
of the existing parallel data, and not too much of
the non-parallel data; using such a lexicon helps
achieve this purpose.
For the last stage, however, precision is
paramount. We found empirically that when us-
ing GIZA-Lex, the incorrect correspondences that
it contains seriously impact the quality of our re-
sults; we therefore need a cleaner lexicon. In addi-
tion, since we want to distinguish between source
words that have a translation on the target side and
words that do not, we also need a measure of the
probability that two words are not translations of
each other. All these are part of our second lexi-
con, LLR-Lex, which we present in detail in Sec-
tion 2.2. Subsequently, in Section 2.3, we present
our algorithm for detecting parallel sub-sentential
fragments.
2.2 Using Log-Likelihood-Ratios to Estimate
Word Translation Probabilities
Our method for computing the probabilistic trans-
lation lexicon LLR-Lex is based on the the Log-
2http://www.fjoch.com/GIZA++.html
Likelihood-Ratio (LLR) statistic (Dunning, 1993),
which has also been used by Moore (2004a;
2004b) and Melamed (2000) as a measure of
word association. Generally speaking, this statis-
tic gives a measure of the likelihood that two sam-
ples are not independent (i.e. generated by the
same probability distribution). We use it to es-
timate the independence of pairs of words which
cooccur in our parallel corpus.
If source word
 
and target word  are indepen-
dent (i.e. they are not translations of each other),
we would expect that 
 	


 	



,
i.e. the distribution of  given that
 
is present
is the same as the distribution of  when
 
is not
present. The LLR statistic gives a measure of the
likelihood of this hypothesis. The LLR score of a
word pair is low when these two distributions are
very similar (i.e. the words are independent), and
high otherwise (i.e. the words are strongly associ-
ated). However, high LLR scores can indicate ei-
ther a positive association (i.e.   	   	 )
or a negative one; and we can distinguish between
them by checking whether 
 	



 	
.
Thus, we can split the set of cooccurring word
pairs into positively and negatively associated
pairs, and obtain a measure for each of the two as-
sociation types. The first type of association will
provide us with our (cleaner) lexicon, while the
second will allow us to estimate probabilities of
words not being translations of each other.
Before describing our new method more for-
mally, we address the notion of word cooc-
currence. In the work of Moore (2004a) and
Melamed (2000), two words cooccur if they are
present in a pair of aligned sentences in the parallel
training corpus. However, most of the words from
aligned sentences are actually unrelated; therefore,
this is a rather weak notion of cooccurrence. We
follow Resnik et. al (2001) and adopt a stronger
definition, based not on sentence alignment but
on word alignment: two words cooccur if they
are linked together in the word-aligned parallel
training corpus. We thus make use of the signifi-
cant amount of knowledge brought in by the word
alignment procedure.
We compute 
 	
, the LLR score for
words  and
 
, using the formula presented by
Moore (2004b), which we do not repeat here due
to lack of space. We then use these values to
compute two conditional probability distributions:

 	
, the proba-
bility that
 
does not translate into  . We obtain
the distributions by normalizing the LLR scores
for each source word.
The whole procedure follows:

Och and Ney (2003), we run GIZA++ in both
directions, and then symmetrize the align-
ments using the refined heuristic.

In order to compute the ff 

distributions,
we reverse the source and target languages and re-
peat the procedure.
As we mentioned above, in GIZA-Lex the aver-
age number of possible translations for a source
word is 12. In LLR-Lex that average is 5, which is
a significant decrease.
2.3 Detecting Parallel Sub-Sentential
Fragments
Intuitively speaking, our method tries to distin-
guish between source fragments that have a trans-
lation on the target side, and fragments that do not.
In Figure 4 we show the sentence pair from Fig-
ure 2, in which we have underlined those words of
each sentence that have a translation in the other
sentence, according to our lexicon LLR-Lex. The
phrases ?to focus on the past year?s achievements,
which,? and ?sa se concentreze pe succesele an-
ului trecut, care,? are mostly underlined (the lexi-
con is unaware of the fact that ?achievements? and
?succesele? are in fact translations of each other,
because ?succesele? is a morphologically inflected
form which does not cooccur with ?achievements?
in our initial parallel corpus). The rest of the
sentences are mostly not underlined, although we
do have occasional connections, some correct and
some wrong. The best we can do in this case is to
infer that these two phrases are parallel, and dis-
card the rest. Doing this gains us some new knowl-
edge: the lexicon entry (achievements, succesele).
We need to quantify more precisely the notions
of ?mostly translated? and ?mostly not translated?.
Our approach is to consider the target sentence as
a numeric signal, where translated words corre-
spond to positive values (coming from the ff fi dis-
tribution described in the previous Section), and
the others to negative ones (coming from the ff 
distribution). We want to retain the parts of the
sentence where the signal is mostly positive. This
can be achieved by applying a smoothing filter to
the signal, and selecting those fragments of the
sentence for which the corresponding filtered val-
ues are positive.
The details of the procedure are presented be-
low, and also illustrated in Figure 5. Let the Ro-
manian sentence be the source sentence 	 , and the
English one be the target, 
 . We compute a word
alignment 	 
 by greedily linking each En-
glish word with its best translation candidate from
the Romanian sentence. For each of the linked tar-
get words, the corresponding signal value is the
probability of the link (there can be at most one
link for each target word). Thus, if target word 
is linked to source word
 
, the signal value cor-
responding to  is ff fi 
 	 (the distribution de-
scribed in Section 2.2), i.e. the probability that 
is the translation of
 
.
For the remaining target words, the signal value
should reflect the probability that they are not
84

and target sentence together with their alignment. Above are displayed the initial signal and the filtered
signal. The circles indicate which fragments of the target sentence are selected by the procedure.
translated; for this, we employ the ff   distribu-
tion. Thus, for each non-linked target word  , we
look for the source word least likely to be its non-
translation:
   

	
ff
 

 	
. If
  
ex-
ists, we set the signal value for  to 
ff 

   
;
otherwise, we set it to  . This is the initial sig-
nal. We obtain the filtered signal by applying an
averaging filter, which sets the value at each point
to be the average of several values surrounding it.
In our experiments, we use the surrounding 5 val-
ues, which produced good results on a develop-
ment set. We then simply retain the ?positive frag-
ments? of 
 , i.e. those fragments for which the
corresponding filtered signal values are positive.
However, this approach will often produce short
?positive fragments? which are not, in fact, trans-
lated in the source sentence. An example of this
is the fragment ?, reports? from Figure 5, which
although corresponds to positive values of the fil-
tered signal, has no translation in Romanian. In
an attempt to avoid such errors, we disregard frag-
ments with less than 3 words.
We repeat the procedure in the other direction
( 
  	 ) to obtain the fragments for   , and
consider the resulting two text chunks as parallel.
For the sentence pair from Figure 5, our system
will output the pair:
people to focus on the past year?s achievements, which, he says
sa se concentreze pe succesele anului trecut, care, printre
3 Experiments
In our experiments, we compare our fragment
extraction method (which we call FragmentEx-
tract) with the sentence extraction approach of
Munteanu and Marcu (2005) (SentenceExtract).
All extracted datasets are evaluated by using them
as additional MT training data and measuring their
impact on the performance of the MT system.
3.1 Corpora
We perform experiments in the context of Roma-
nian to English machine translation. We use two
initial parallel corpora. One is the training data
for the Romanian-English word alignment task
from the Workshop on Building and Using Par-
allel Corpora3 which has approximately 1M En-
glish words. The other contains additional data

Table 1: Sizes of our comparable corpora
from the Romanian translations of the European
Union?s acquis communautaire which we mined
from the Web, and has about 10M English words.
We downloaded comparable data from three on-
line news sites: the BBC, and the Romanian news-
papers ?Evenimentul Zilei? and ?Ziua?. The BBC
corpus is precisely the kind of corpus that our
method is designed to exploit. It is truly non-
parallel; as our example from Figure 1 shows, even
closely related documents have few or no parallel
sentence pairs. Therefore, we expect that our ex-
traction method should perform best on this cor-
pus.
The other two sources are fairly similar, both in
genre and in degree of parallelism, so we group
them together and refer to them as the EZZ cor-
pus. This corpus exhibits a higher degree of par-
allelism than the BBC one; in particular, it con-
tains many article pairs which are literal transla-
tions of each other. Therefore, although our sub-
sentence extraction method should produce useful
data from this corpus, we expect the sentence ex-
traction method to be more successful. Using this
second corpus should help highlight the strengths
and weaknesses of our approach.
Table 1 summarizes the relevant information
concerning these corpora.
3.2 Extraction Experiments
On each of our comparable corpora, and using
each of our initial parallel corpora, we apply
both the fragment extraction and the sentence ex-
traction method of Munteanu and Marcu (2005).
In order to evaluate the importance of the LLR-
Lex lexicon, we also performed fragment extrac-
tion experiments that do not use this lexicon, but
only GIZA-Lex. Thus, for each initial parallel
corpus and each comparable corpus, we extract
three datasets: FragmentExtract, SentenceExtract,
and Fragment-noLLR. The sizes of the extracted
datasets, measured in million English tokens, are
presented in Table 2.

Table 2: Sizes of the extracted datasets.
3.3 SMT Performance Results
We evaluate our extracted corpora by measuring
their impact on the performance of an SMT sys-
tem. We use the initial parallel corpora to train
Baseline systems; and then train comparative sys-
tems using the initial corpora plus: the Frag-
mentExtract corpora; the SentenceExtract cor-
pora; and the FragmentExtract-noLLR corpora. In
order to verify whether the fragment and sentence
detection method complement each other, we also
train a Fragment+Sentence system, on the ini-
tial corpus plus FragmentExtract and SentenceEx-
tract.
All MT systems are trained using a variant
of the alignment template model of Och and
Ney (2004). All systems use the same 2 language
models: one trained on 800 million English to-
kens, and one trained on the English side of all
our parallel and comparable corpora. This ensures
that differences in performance are caused only by
differences in the parallel training data.
Our test data consists of news articles from the
Time Bank corpus, which were translated into
Romanian, and has 1000 sentences. Transla-
tion performance is measured using the automatic
BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) metric, on one ref-
erence translation. We report BLEU% numbers,
i.e. we multiply the original scores by 100. The
95% confidence intervals of our scores, computed
by bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004), indicate
that a score increase of more than 1 BLEU% is
statistically significant.
The scores are presented in Figure 6. On the
BBC corpus, the fragment extraction method pro-
duces statistically significant improvements over
the baseline, while the sentence extraction method
does not. Training on both datasets together brings
further improvements. This indicates that this cor-
pus has few parallel sentences, and that by go-
ing to the sub-sentence level we make better use
of it. On the EZZ corpus, although our method
brings improvements in the BLEU score, the sen-
86
Figure 6: SMT performance results
tence extraction method does better. Joining both
extracted datasets does not improve performance;
since most of the parallel data in this corpus exists
at sentence level, the extracted fragments cannot
bring much additional knowledge.
The Fragment-noLLR datasets bring no transla-
tion performance improvements; moreover, when
the initial corpus is small (1M words) and the com-
parable corpus is noisy (BBC), the data has a nega-
tive impact on the BLEU score. This indicates that
LLR-Lex is a higher-quality lexicon than GIZA-
Lex, and an important component of our method.
4 Previous Work
Much of the work involving comparable corpora
has focused on extracting word translations (Fung
and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Diab and Finch, 2000;
Koehn and Knight, 2000; Gaussier et al, 2004;
Shao and Ng, 2004; Shinyama and Sekine, 2004).
Another related research effort is that of Resnik
and Smith (2003), whose system is designed to
discover parallel document pairs on the Web.
Our work lies between these two directions; we
attempt to discover parallelism at the level of frag-
ments, which are longer than one word but shorter
than a document. Thus, the previous research most
relevant to this paper is that aimed at mining com-
parable corpora for parallel sentences.
The earliest efforts in this direction are those
of Zhao and Vogel (2002) and Utiyama and Isa-
hara (2003). Both methods extend algorithms de-
signed to perform sentence alignment of parallel
texts: they use dynamic programming to do sen-
tence alignment of documents hypothesized to be
similar. These approaches are only applicable to
corpora which are at most ?noisy-parallel?, i.e.
contain documents which are fairly similar, both
in content and in sentence ordering.
Munteanu and Marcu (2005) analyze sentence
pairs in isolation from their context, and clas-
sify them as parallel or non-parallel. They match
each source document with several target ones,
and classify all possible sentence pairs from each
document pair. This enables them to find sen-
tences from fairly dissimilar documents, and to
handle any amount of reordering, which makes the
method applicable to truly comparable corpora.
The research reported by Fung and Che-
ung (2004a; 2004b), Cheung and Fung (2004) and
Wu and Fung (2005) is aimed explicitly at ?very
non-parallel corpora?. They also pair each source
document with several target ones and examine all
possible sentence pairs; but the list of document
pairs is not fixed. After one round of sentence ex-
traction, the list is enriched with additional docu-
ments, and the system iterates. Thus, they include
in the search document pairs which are dissimilar.
One limitation of all these methods is that they
are designed to find only full sentences. Our
methodology is the first effort aimed at detecting
sub-sentential correspondences. This is a difficult
task, requiring the ability to recognize translation-
ally equivalent fragments even in non-parallel sen-
tence pairs.
The work of Deng et. al (2006) also deals with
sub-sentential fragments. However, they obtain
parallel fragments from parallel sentence pairs (by
chunking them and aligning the chunks appropri-
ately), while we obtain them from comparable or
non-parallel sentence pairs.
Since our approach can extract parallel data
from texts which contain few or no parallel sen-
tences, it greatly expands the range of corpora
which can be usefully exploited.
5 Conclusion
We have presented a simple and effective method
for extracting sub-sentential fragments from com-
parable corpora. We also presented a method for
computing a probabilistic lexicon based on the
LLR statistic, which produces a higher quality lex-
icon. We showed that using this lexicon helps im-
prove the precision of our extraction method.
Our approach can be improved in several
aspects. The signal filtering function is very
simple; more advanced filters might work better,
and eliminate the need of applying additional
87
heuristics (such as our requirement that the
extracted fragments have at least 3 words). The
fact that the source and target signal are filtered
separately is also a weakness; a joint analysis
should produce better results. Despite the better
lexicon, the greatest source of errors is still related
to false word correspondences, generally involv-
ing punctuation and very common, closed-class
words. Giving special attention to such cases
should help get rid of these errors, and improve
the precision of the method.
