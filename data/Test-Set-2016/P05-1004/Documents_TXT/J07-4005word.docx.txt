Abstract

There has  been a great deal of recent research into word sense disambiguation, particularly 
since the inception of the Senseval evaluation  exercises.  Because a word often has more than 
one meaning,  resolving word sense ambiguity could benefit applications that need some level 
of semantic interpretation of language input. A major problem is that the accuracy of word 
sense disambiguation  systems is strongly  dependent on the quantity  of manually  sense-tagged 
data available, and even the best systems,  when tagging every word token in a document, 
perform little better than a simple heuristic  that guesses the first, or predominant, sense of a 
word in all contexts.  The success of this heuristic is due to the skewed nature of word sense 
distributions. Data for the heuristic can come from either dictionaries or a sample  of sense- 
tagged data. However, there is a limited supply of the latter, and the sense distributions and 
predominant sense of a word can depend on the domain or source of a document.  (The first 
sense of “star” for example would be different in the popular  press and scientific journals). 
In this article, we expand on a previously proposed method for determining the predominant 
sense of a word automatically from raw text. We look at a number  of different data sources and 
parameterizations of the method, using evaluation results and error analyses to identify where 
the method performs well and also where it does not. In particular, we find that the method 
does not work as well for verbs and adverbs as nouns and adjectives, but produces more accurate 
predominant sense information than the widely  used SemCor corpus for nouns with low coverage 
in that corpus. We further show that the method is able to adapt successfully to domains when 
using  domain  specific corpora as input and where the input can either be hand-labeled for domain 
or automatically classified.

1. Introduction

In word sense disambiguation, the “first sense” heuristic (choosing the first, or predom- 
inant  sense  of a word) is used  by most  state-of-the-art systems as a back-off  method 
when  information from  the context  is not  sufficient  to make  a more  informed choice. 
In this  article,  we  present an  in-depth study of a method for automatically acquiring 
predominant senses for words from raw text (McCarthy et al. 2004a).
    The  method  uses  distributionally  similar   words listed   as  “nearest  neighbors” 
in  automatically acquired thesauruses (e.g.,  Lin  1998a), and  takes  advantage of the 
observation that  the more  prevalent a sense  of a word, the more  neighbors will relate 
to that  sense,  and  the  higher their  distributional similarity scores  will  be. The senses 
of a word are defined in a sense  inventory. We use WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) because 
this  is widely used,  is publicly available, and  has  plenty of gold-standard evaluation 
data available (Miller et al. 1993; Cotton  et al. 2001; Preiss and Yarowsky 2001; Mihalcea 
and Edmonds 2004). The distributional strength of the neighbors is associated with the 
senses of a word using a measure of semantic similarity which relies on the relationships 
between word senses,  such as hyponyms (available in an inventory such as WordNet) 
or overlap in the definitions of word senses (available in most dictionaries), or both.
    In this  article  we  provide a detailed discussion and  quantitative analysis of the 
motivation behind the  first sense  heuristic, and  a full description of our  method. We 
extend  previously reported work  in a number of different directions:

•	We evaluate the method on all parts  of speech  (PoS) on SemCor (Miller et 
al. 1993). Previous experiments (McCarthy et al. 2004c) evaluated only 
nouns on SemCor, or all PoS but only on the Senseval-2  (Cotton  et al. 2001) 
and Senseval-3 (Mihalcea  and Edmonds 2004) data. The evaluation on all 
PoS is much  more extensive because  the SemCor corpus is composed of
220,000 words in contrast to the 6 documents in the Senseval-2  and -3
English all words data  (10,000 words).
•	We compare two WordNet similarity measures in our evaluation on nouns, 
and also contrast performance using  two publicly available thesauruses, 
both produced from the same NEWSWIRE corpus, but one derived using  
a proximity-based approach and the other using dependency relations 
from a parser. It turns out that the results from the proximity-based 
thesaurus are comparable to those from the dependency-
based  thesaurus; this is encouraging for applying the method to languages 
without sophisticated analysis tools.
•	We manually analyze a sample of errors  from the SemCor evaluation. A 
small number of errors  can be traced  back to inherent shortcomings of our 
method, but the main source  of error is due to noise from related senses. 
This is a common problem for all WSD systems (Ide and Wilks 2006) but 
one which is only recently starting to be addressed by the WSD 
community (Navigli,  Litkowski, and Hargraves 2007).
•	One motivation for an automatic method for acquiring predominant 
senses is that there will always be words for which  there are insufficient 
data available in manually sense-tagged resources. We compare the 
performance of our automatic method with the first sense heuristic 
derived from SemCor on nouns in the Senseval-2  data. We find that the


554





automatic method outperforms the one obtained from manual annotations 
in SemCor for nouns with fewer than  five occurrences in SemCor.
•	Aside from the lack of coverage of manually annotated data, there is a 
need for first sense heuristics to be specific to domain. We explore  the 
potential for applying the method with domain-specific text for all PoS in 
an experiment using  a gold-standard domain-specific resource (Magnini 
and Cavaglia` 2000) which  we have used  previously only with nouns. We 
show  that although there is a little mileage  to be had from domain-specific 
first sense heuristics for verbs, nouns benefit greatly from domain-specific 
training.
•	In previous work  (Koeling, McCarthy, and Carroll  2005) we produced 
manually sense-annotated domain-specific test corpora for a lexical 
sample, and demonstrated that predominant senses acquired (from
hand-classified corpora) in the same domain as the test data outperformed 
the SemCor first sense. We further this exploration by contrasting with 
results from training on automatically categorized text from the English 
Gigaword Corpus and show  that the results are comparable to those using 
hand-classified domain data.

    The article is organized as follows.  In the next section  we motivate the use of pre- 
dominant sense information in WSD systems and the need for acquiring this information 
automatically. In Section 3 we give an overview of related work in WSD, focusing on the 
acquisition of prior sense distributions and domain-specific sense information. Section 4 
describes our  acquisition method. Section  5 describes the  experimental setup  for the 
work  reported in this article.  Section 6 describes four  experiments. The first evaluates 
the first sense  heuristic using  predominant sense  information acquired for all PoS on 
SemCor;  for nouns we  compare two  semantic similarity methods and  three  different 
types  of distributional thesaurus. We also  report an  error  analysis for all PoS of our 
method. The second  experiment compares the  performance of the  automatic method 
to the  manually produced data  in SemCor,  on nouns in the  Senseval-2  data,  looking 
particularly at nouns which  have a low frequency in SemCor. The third  uses corpora in 
restricted domains and  the subject  field code  gold  standard of Magnini and  Cavaglia` 
(2000) to investigate the potential for domain-specific rankings for different PoS. The 
fourth compares results when  we  train  and  test  on  domain-specific corpora, where 
the  training data  is (1) manually categorized for domain and  from  the  same  corpus 
as the test data, and (2) where the training data is harvested automatically from another 
corpus which  is categorized automatically. Finally, we conclude (Section 7) and discuss 
directions for future work  (Section 8).

2. Motivation

The  problem of disambiguating the  meanings of  words in  text  has  received much 
attention recently,  particularly since the inception of the Senseval  evaluation exercises 
(Kilgarriff  and  Palmer  2000; Preiss  and  Yarowsky 2001; Mihalcea  and  Edmonds 2004). 
One of the standard Senseval tasks (the “all words” task) is to tag each open class word 
with one of its senses, as listed in a dictionary or thesaurus such as WordNet (Fellbaum
1998). The most  accurate word sense  disambiguation (WSD) systems use  supervised 
machine learning approaches (Stevenson and  Wilks  2001), trained on text  which  has 
been  sense  tagged by  hand. However, the  performance of these  systems is strongly


555





dependent on  the  quantity of training data  available (Yarowsky and  Florian  2002), 
and manually sense-annotated text is extremely costly to produce (Kilgarriff 1998). The 
largest  all words sense  tagged corpus is SemCor,  which  is 220,000 words taken  from
103 passages, each of about  2,000 words, from  the Brown  corpus (Francis  and  Kucˇera
1979) and the complete text of a 19th-century American novel, The Red Badge of Courage, 
which totals 45,600 words (Landes,  Leacock, and Tengi 1998). Approximately half of the 
words in this corpus are open-class words (nouns, verbs,  adjectives,  and  adverbs) and 
these have been linked  to WordNet senses by human taggers using a software interface. 
The  shortage of training data  due  to  the  high  costs  of tagging texts  has  motivated 
research into unsupervised methods for WSD. But in the English  all-words tasks in 
Senseval-2   and   Senseval-3   (Snyder   and   Palmer   2004), systems  that   did  not  make 
use of hand-tagged data  (in some  form  or other)  performed substantially worse  than 
those  that  did.  Table  1 summarizes the  situation. It gives  the  precision and  recall  of 
the best1  two  supervised (S) and  unsupervised (U)2  systems for the English  all words 
and  English  lexical sample for Senseval-23  and  -3, along  with  the  first sense  baseline 
(FS) reported by the task  organizers.4  This is a simple  application of the “first  sense” 
heuristic—that is, using the most common sense of a word for every instance of it in the 
test corpus, regardless of context.  Although contextual WSD is of course  preferable, the 
baseline  is a very powerful one and  unsupervised systems find it surprisingly hard  to 
beat (indeed, some of the systems that report themselves as unsupervised actually make 
some use of a manually obtained first-sense heuristic). Considering both precision and 
recall, only 5 of 26 systems in the Senseval-3  English  all-words task beat the first sense 
heuristic as derived from  SemCor  (61.5%5 ), and  then  by only a few percentage points 
(the top  system  scoring  65% precision and  recall)  despite using  hand-tagged training 
data  available from  SemCor  and  previous Senseval  data  sets, large  sets of contextual 
features, and sophisticated machine learning algorithms.
    The  performance of  WSD  systems, at  least  for  all-words tasks,  seems  to  have 
plateaued at a level just above the first sense heuristic (Snyder  and Palmer  2004). This is 
due to the shortage of training data  and the often fine granularity of sense distinctions. 
Ide  and  Wilks  (2006) argue  that  it is best  to concentrate effort  on  distinctions which 
are  useful  for applications and  where systems can be confident of high  precision. In 
cases where systems are less confident, but word senses, rather than words, are needed, 
the first sense  heuristic is a powerful back-off  strategy. This strategy is dependent on 
information provided in dictionaries. Two dictionaries that  have been used  by English 
WSD systems are the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English  (LDOCE) (Procter



1 We rank the systems by the recall scores, because  this is the accuracy  over the entire  test set regardless of 
how many  items were attempted.
2 Note that the classification of systems as unsupervised is not straightforward. Systems reported as 
unsupervised in the Senseval  proceedings sometimes make use of some manual annotations. For 
example, the top scoring  system  that reported itself unsupervised in the Senseval-3 lexical sample task 
used  manually sense-tagged training data for constructing glosses.
3 The verb lexical sample was done  as a separate exercise for Senseval-2, and for brevity we have not 
included the results from this task.
4 The all-words task organizers used  the first sense as listed in WordNet. This is based  on the SemCor first 
sense because  WordNet senses are ordered according to the frequency data  in SemCor. However, where 
senses are not found in WordNet, the ordering is arbitrarily determined as a function of the “grind” 
program (see http://wordnet.princeton.edu/man/grind.1WN.htm). The lexical sample task organizers 
state that they use the “most  frequent sense”  but do not stipulate if this is taken  from WordNet, or 
directly from SemCor.
5 This figure is the arithmetic mean  of two published estimates (Snyder  and Palmer  2004), the difference 
being due to the treatment of multiwords.

1978) and  WordNet (Fellbaum 1998). These  both  provide a ranking of senses  accord- 
ing  to  their  predominance. The  sense  ordering in  LDOCE  is based  on  lexicographer 
intuition, whereas in WordNet the senses  are ordered according to their  frequency in 
SemCor (Miller et al. 1993).
    There are two major problems with deriving a first sense heuristic from these types 
of resources. The  first  is that  the  predominant sense  of a word varies  according to 
the  source  of the  document (McCarthy and  Carroll  2003) and  with  the  domain. For 
example, the first sense of star as derived from SemCor is celestial body, but if one were 
disambiguating popular news  stories  then  celebrity  would be more  likely.  Domain, 
topic, and  genre  are important in WSD (Martinez and  Agirre  2000; Magnini et al. 2002) 
and  the  sense-frequency distributions of words depend on  all of these  factors.  Any 
dictionary will provide only a single sense ranking, whether this is derived from sense- 
tagged data as in WordNet, lexicographer intuition as in LDOCE, or inspection of corpus 
data  as in the Oxford  Advanced Learner ’s Dictionary (Hornby 1989). A fixed order  of 
senses may not reflect the data that an NLP system  is dealing with.
    The second  problem with  obtaining predominant sense information applies to the 
use of hand-tagged resources, such as SemCor.  Such resources are relatively small due 
to the cost of manual tagging (Kilgarriff 1998). Many words will simply  not be covered, 
or occur only a few times. For many  words in WordNet the ordering of word senses  is 
based  on a very  small  number of occurrences in SemCor.  For example, the first sense 
of tiger is an audacious  person  whereas most  people  would assume the  carnivorous 
animal sense is more prevalent. This is because  the two senses each occur exactly once 
in SemCor,  and  when  there  is no frequency information to break  the tie the WordNet 
sense  ordering is assigned arbitrarily. There  are many  fairly  common words (such  as 
the  noun  crane) which  do  not  occur  at all in SemCor.  Table  2 gives  the  number and 
percentage of words6 in WordNet and  the BNC which  do not occur in SemCor.  As one 
would expect from Zipf’s law, a substantial number of words do not occur in SemCor, 
even when we do not consider multiwords. Many of these words are extremely rare, but


6 Here and elsewhere in this article we give figures  only for words without embedded spaces, that is, not 
multiwords.

in any given document it is likely that there will be at least some words without SemCor 
data. Table 3 quantifies this, for the Senseval-2 and -3 all-words tasks test data, showing 
the percentage of polysemous word types with no frequency information in SemCor, the 
percentage with zero or one occurrences, and the percentage with up to five occurrences. 
(For example, the table indicates that 12.9% of nouns in the Senseval-2  data,  and 16.7% 
in Senseval-3,  have five or fewer  occurrences in SemCor.) Thus, although SemCor  may 
cover many  frequently occurring word types in a given document, there are likely to be 
a substantial proportion for which  there is very little or no information available.
    Tables  4 and  5 present an analysis of the  actual  ambiguity of polysemous words 
within the  six documents making up  the  Senseval-2  and  -3 all-words test  data.  They 
show  the  extent  to  which  these  words are  used  in  a  predominant sense,  within a 
document, and  the extent  to which  this is the same  as that  given  by SemCor.  The two 
tables share a common format: columns 2–5 give percentages over all “document/word 
type”  combinations. The second  column shows  the percentage of the “document/word 
type”  combinations where the word is used  in the document in only one of its senses. 
The fourth column shows  the same percentage but for “document/word type”  combi- 
nations where the word is used  in more than  one sense in the document. The third  and 
fifth columns give the percentage of the words in the preceding columns (second  and 
fourth, respectively) where the first sense for the word in the document is the same as in 
SemCor (FS = SC FS). For the third  column, this is the only sense that this word appears 
in within the document. (Note that for any row, columns 2 and 4 account for all possibil- 
ities so will always add up to 100.) The sixth column gives the mean degree of polysemy, 
according to WordNet, for the set of words that these figures  are calculated for.

    The figures  in Table 4 are for words occurring more  than  once in a given  Senseval 
test  document. The  tendency for  words to  be  used  in  only  one  sense  in  any  given 
document7  is strongest for nouns, although adverbs and  adjectives also tend  towards 
one sense. Verbs are on average much  more polysemous than  the other  parts  of speech 
yet still 45.6% of polysemous verbs which occur more than once are used in only a single 
sense. However, because  verbs  are in general more  polysemous, it makes  it less likely 
that if a verb occurs in only one sense in a document then it will be the one indicated by 
SemCor.
    The figures in Table 5 are for all words in the Senseval documents (not just those oc- 
curring more than once), showing the accuracy of a SemCor-derived first-sense heuristic 
for words with a frequency below a specified  threshold (column 1) in SemCor. The table 
shows  that although having a first sense from SemCor is certainly useful,  when  looking 
at figures  for all the  words in the  Senseval  documents a good  proportion have  first 
senses  other  than  the one indicated by SemCor.  Furthermore, the lower  the frequency 
in SemCor the more likely that the first sense indicated by SemCor is wrong. (However, 
the  situation is slightly  different for  adverbs because  there  are  not  many  with  low 
frequency in SemCor  and  they are on average not very polysemous, so for them  a first 
sense derived from a resource like SemCor—where one exists—is possibly sufficient.)
    These results show  that although SemCor is a useful  resource, there  will always be 
words for which  its coverage is inadequate. In addition, few languages have extensive 
hand-tagged resources or sense orderings produced by lexicographers. Moreover, gen- 
eral resources containing word sense information are not likely to be appropriate when 
processing language for a wider variety of domains, topics, and genres.  What is needed 
is a means  to find predominant senses automatically.


3. Related Work

Most research in WSD to date  has concentrated on using  contextual features, typically 
neighboring words, to help  infer  the  correct  sense  of a target  word.  In contrast, our 
work  is aimed  at discovering the predominant sense of a word from raw  text because


7 The tendency for words to be used  in only one sense in a given discourse is weaker for fine-grained 
distinctions (Krovetz  1998) compared to coarse-grained distinctions (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992). 
Nevertheless, even with a fine-grained inventory the first sense heuristic is certainly powerful, as shown 
in Table 1.

the first sense heuristic is so powerful, and  because  manually sense-tagged data  is not 
always available.
    Lapata  and  Brew (2004) highlighted the importance of a good  prior  in WSD. They 
used  syntactic evidence to find  a prior  distribution for Levin  (1993) verb  classes,  and 
incorporated this  in  a WSD  system.  Lapata  and  Brew  obtained their  priors for  verb 
classes  directly from  subcategorization evidence in a parsed corpus, whereas we use 
parsed data  to  find  distributionally similar  words (nearest neighbors) to  the  target 
word which  reflect the different senses  of the word and  have  associated distributional 
similarity scores  which  can  be used  for ranking the  senses  according to prevalence. 
We would, however, agree  that  subcategorization evidence should be very  useful  for 
disambiguating verbs,  and  would hope  to combine such  evidence with  our  ranking 
models for context-based WSD.
    A major benefit of our work is that this method permits us to produce predominant 
senses  for any desired domain and  text type.  Buitelaar  and  Sacaleanu (2001) explored 
ranking and  selection  of synsets in GermaNet for specific  domains using  the  words 
in  a  given  synset,  and  those  related by  hyponymy, and  a  term  relevance measure 
taken  from  information retrieval. Buitelaar  and  Sacaleanu evaluated their  method on 
identifying domain-specific concepts using human judgments on 100 items. We evaluate


560





our  method using  publicly available resources for  balanced text,  and,  for  domain- 
specific  investigations, resources we  have  developed ourselves (Koeling,  McCarthy, 
and  Carroll  2005). Magnini and  Cavaglia` (2000) associated WordNet word senses  with 
particular domains, and  this  has  proved useful  for  high  precision WSD  (Magnini et 
al. 2001); indeed, we  have  used  their  domain labels  (or subject  field  codes,  SFCs) for 
evaluation (Section 6.3). Identification of these SFCs for word senses was semi-automatic 
and required a considerable amount of hand-labeling. Our approach requires only raw 
text from the given domain and because  of this it can easily be applied to a new domain 
or sense inventory, as long as there is enough appropriate text.
    There  are  other  approaches aimed  at gleaning domain-specific information from 
raw data. Gliozzo, Giuliano, and Strapparava (2005) induced domain models from raw 
data  using  unsupervised latent  semantic models and  then  fed  this  into  a supervised 
WSD  model  and  evaluated on Senseval-3  lexical sample data  in four  languages. Chan 
and Ng (2005) obtained probability distributions to feed into their supervised WSD mod- 
els. They used  multilingual parallel corpus data  to provide probability estimates for a 
subset of 22 nouns from the lexical sample task. They then fed this into a supervised WSD 
model  and verified  that the estimates for prior  distributions improved performance for 
supervised WSD. We intend eventually to use  our  prevalence scores  to feed  into  un- 
supervised WSD models. Although unsupervised models seem to be beaten  whenever 
there is training data to be had, we anticipate that unsupervised models with improved 
priors from the ranking might  outperform supervised systems in situations where there 
is little training data available. Whereas this article is about  finding predominant senses 
for back-off in a WSD system, the method could be applied to finding a prior distribution 
over all word senses of each target word. It is our intention that the back-off models pro- 
duced by our  prevalence ranking, either  as predominant senses  or prior  distributions 
over word senses, could be combined with contextual information for WSD.
   Mohammad and Hirst (2006) describe an approach to acquiring predominant senses 
from corpora which makes use of the category information in the Macquarie Thesaurus. 
Evaluation is performed on an artificially constructed test set from unambiguous words 
in the same  category as the 27 test words (nouns, verbs,  and  adjectives). The senses  of 
the words are the categories of the thesaurus and  the experiment uses only two senses 
of each word, the two most predominant ones. The predominance of the two senses  is 
altered systematically. The results are encouraging because  a much  smaller  amount of 
corpus data is needed compared to our approach. However, their method has only been 
applied to an artificially constructed test set, rather than a publicly available corpus, and 
has yet to be applied in a domain-specific setting,  which  is the chief motivation of our 
work.
    The  work  of  Pantel  and  Lin  (2002) is  probably the  most  closely  related study 
that  predates ours,  although their  ultimate goal  is different. Pantel  and  Lin devised 
a  method called  CBC (clustering by  committee) where the  10 nearest neighbors of 
a word in  a distributional thesaurus are  clustered to  identify the  various senses  of 
the  word. Pantel  and  Lin use  a measure of semantic similarity (Lin 1997) to evaluate 
the discovered classes  with  respect  to WordNet as a gold  standard. The CBC method 
obtained a  precision of  61% (the  percentage of  senses  discovered that  did  exist  in 
WordNet) and  a recall of 51% (the percentage of senses  discovered from  the union  of 
those discovered with different clustering algorithms that they tried).8



8 The calculation of recall was over the union  of senses discovered automatically, rather than over the 
senses in WordNet, because  senses in WordNet may be unattested in the data.


561





    Pantel  and  Lin’s approach is related to ours  in that,  in their  sense  discovery pro- 
cedure, predominant senses  have  more  of a chance  of being  found than  other  senses, 
although their  algorithm is specifically  tailored to  look  for  senses  regardless of fre- 
quency. To do  this  the  algorithm removes neighbors of  the  target  word once  they 
are assigned to a cluster  so that  less frequent senses  can be discovered. Our  method, 
described in detail  in Section  4, associates the  nearest neighbors to the  senses  of the 
target  in a predefined inventory (we use WordNet). We rank the senses using a measure 
which  sums  over the distributional similarity of neighbors weighted by the strength of 
the association between the neighbors and  the sense.  This is done  on the assumption 
that  more  prevalent senses  will have  strong associations with  more  nearest neighbors 
because  they  have  occurred in  more  contexts  in  the  corpus used  for  producing the 
thesaurus. Both the number and  the distributional similarity of the neighbors are used 
in our prevalence ranking measure. Pantel and Lin process  the possible  clusters in order 
of their  average distributional similarity and  number of neighbors but do not take the 
number of neighbors into  account in the  scores  given  for the  clusters. The measures 
that  Pantel  and  Lin associate  with  their  clusters are  determined by the  cohesiveness 
of the  cluster  with  the  target  word because  their  aim  is one of sense  discovery. Their 
measure is the similarity between the cluster  and  the target  word and  does  not retain 
the distributional similarity of the neighbors within the cluster.  It is quite  possible  that 
there is a low frequency sense of a target  word with synonyms that form a nice cohesive 
group.
   Although the  number of neighbors assigned to a cluster  may  correlate with  our 
ranking score, intuition suggests that  a combination of the quantity and  distributional 
similarity of neighbors to the  target  word sense  is best  for  determining the  relative 
predominance of senses. In Section 6 we test this hypothesis using  a simplified version 
of our  method which  only  uses  the  number of neighbors, and  assigns  each  to  one 
sense.  Comparisons with  the  CBC algorithm as it stands would be difficult  because 
in order  to evaluate acquisition of predominance information we have  used  publicly 
available gold-standard  sense-tagged corpora, and  these  have  WordNet senses.  CBC 
will not always find WordNet senses.  For example, using  the on-line  demonstration  of 
CBC,9  several  common senses  from  nouns from  the Senseval-2  lexical sample are not 
discovered, including the upright  object  sense  of post, the block  of something sense 
of bar, the daytime  sense of day and  the meaning  of the word sense of the word sense. 
Automatic acquisition of sense  inventories is an important endeavor, and  we hope  to 
look at ways  of combining our method for detecting predominance with  automatically 
induced inventories such as those produced by CBC. Evaluation of induced inventories 
should be done  in the context of an application, because  the senses will be keyed  to the 
acquisition corpus and not to WordNet.
   Induction of senses  allows  coverage of senses  appearing in the  data  that  are  not 
present in a predefined inventory. Although we could  adapt our  method for use with 
an automatically induced inventory, our  method which  uses  WordNet might  also be 
combined with  one that  can automatically find  new  senses  from  text and  then  relate 
these  to WordNet synsets,  as Ciaramita and  Johnson  (2003) and  Curran (2005) do with 
unknown nouns.





9 We used  the demonstration at http://www.isi.edu/~pantel/Content/Demos/LexSem/cbc.htm with the 
option to include all corpora (TREC-2002, TREC-9, and COSMOS).

4. Method

In our  method, the predominant sense  for a target  word is determined from  a preva- 
lence ranking of the possible  senses  for that  word. The senses  come from a predefined 
inventory (which  might   be  a  dictionary or  WordNet-like resource). The  ranking  is 
derived using  a distributional thesaurus automatically produced from  a large  corpus, 
and  a semantic similarity measure defined over the sense inventory. The distributional 
thesaurus contains a set of words that  are “nearest neighbors” to the target  word with 
respect  to similarity of the way in which  they are distributed. (Distributional similarity 
is based  on the hypothesis of Harris, 1968, that  words which  occur  in similar  contexts 
have  related meanings.) The thesaurus assigns  a distributional similarity score to each 
neighbor word, indicating its closeness  to the target  word. For example, the nearest10 
neighbors of sandwich might  be:


salad, pizza, bread, soup...


and the nearest neighbors of the polysemous noun  star11 might  be:


actor, footballer, planet, circle...


These neighbors reflect the various senses of the word, which  for star might  be:

•	a celebrity
•	a celestial body
•	a shape
•	a sign of the zodiac12

We assume that the number and distributional similarity scores of neighbors pertaining 
to a given  sense of a target  word will reflect the prevalence of that  sense  in the corpus 
from which  the thesaurus was derived. This is because  the more prevalent senses of the 
word will appear more frequently and in more contexts than other, less prevalent senses. 
The neighbors of the  target  word relate  to its senses,  but  are themselves word forms 
rather than  senses.  The senses  of the target  word are predefined in a sense  inventory 
and  we use a semantic similarity score  defined over  the sense  inventory to relate  the 
neighbors to the various senses  of the target  word. The two semantic similarity scores 
that we use in this article are implemented in the WordNet similarity package. One uses 
the  overlap in definitions of word senses,  based  on Lesk (1986), and  the  other  uses  a 
combination of corpus statistics and  the WordNet hyponym hierarchy, based  on Jiang 
and  Conrath (1997). We describe these fully in Section 4.2. We now describe  intuitively



10 In this and other  examples we restrict  ourselves to four neighbors for brevity.
11 In this example we assume that the sense inventory assigns  four senses to star, but the inventory could 
assign  fewer or more depending on its level of granularity and level of detail.
12 Note that this zodiac or horoscope sense of star usually occurs as part of the multiword star sign (e.g.,
your star sign secrets revealed) or in plural form (your stars today—free online).

the measure for ranking the senses  according to predominance, and  then  give a more 
formal  definition.
The measure uses the sum total of the distributional similarity scores of the k nearest
neighbors. This total is divided between the senses  of the target  word by apportioning 
the  distributional similarity of each  neighbor to the senses.   The contribution of each 
neighbor is measured in terms  of its distributional similarity score  so that  “nearer ” 
neighbors count for more. The distributional similarity score of each neighbor is divided 
between the various senses rather than  attributing the neighbor to only one sense. This 
is done  because  neighbors can relate  to more  than  one sense due  to relationships such 
as systematic polysemy. For  example, in the  thesaurus we  describe  subsequently in 
Section 4.1 acquired from the BNC, chicken has neighbors duck and goose which  relate  to 
both the meat and  animal senses.  We apportion the contribution of a neighbor to each 
of the word senses  according to a weight which  is the normalized semantic similarity 
score between the sense and  the neighbor. We normalize the semantic similarity scores 
because  some  of the  semantic similarity scores  that  we  use,  described in Section  4.2, 
can get disproportionately large. Because we normalize the semantic similarity scores, 
the sum of the ranking scores for a word equals  the sum of the distributional similarity 
scores. To summarize, we rank the senses of the target  word, such as star, by apportion- 
ing the distributional similarity scores of the top k neighbors between the senses.  Each 
distributional similarity score  (dss) is weighted by  a normalized semantic similarity 
score (sss) between the sense and the neighbor. This process  is illustrated in Figure  1.
    More  formally, to find  the  predominant sense  of a word (w) we  take  each  sense 
in turn  and  obtain  a prevalence score. Let Nw  = {n1 , n2 ...nk } be the ordered set of the
top  scoring  k neighbors of w from  the distributional thesaurus with  associated scores
{dss(w, n1 ), dss(w, n2 ), ...dss(w, nk )}. Let senses(w) be the  set of senses  of w in the  sense 
inventory. For each sense of w (si  ∈ senses(w)) we obtain  a prevalence score by summing 
over the dss(w, nj ) of each neighbor (nj  ∈ Nw ) multiplied by a weight. This weight is the
sss between the target  sense (si ) and nj divided by the sum of all sss scores for senses(w)

and nj . sss is the maximum WordNet similarity score (ssst) between si  and the senses of
nj (sx  ∈ senses(nj )).13 Each sense si  ∈ senses(w) is therefore assigned a score as follows:

sss(si, nj )


Prevalence Score(w, si ) = )
nj ∈Nw


dss(w, nj ) ×
siit ∈senses(w)

, n )	(1)



where



sss(si, nj ) = 	max
sx ∈senses(nj )


ssst (si , sx )	(2)



We describe  dss and  ssst in Sections  4.1 and  4.2. Note  that  the dss for a given  neighbor
is shared between the  different senses  of w depending on  the  weight given  by  the 
normalized sss.

4.1 The Distributional Similarity Score

Measures of distributional similarity take  into  account the shared contexts  of the two 
words. Several  measures of distributional similarity have  been described in the litera- 
ture.  In our  experiments, dss is computed using  Lin’s similarity measure (Lin 1998a). 
We set the number of nearest neighbors to equal  50.14 We use three  different sources  of 
data  for our  first two experiments, resulting in three  distributional thesauruses. These 
are described in the next section. We use domain-specific data  for our third  and  fourth 
experiments. The data  sources  for these are described in Sections 6.3 and 6.4.
    A word, w, is described by a set of features, f , each with  an associated frequency, 
where each  feature is a pair  (r, x) consisting of a grammatical relation name  and  the
other word in the relation. We computed distributional similarity scores for every pair of 
words of the same PoS where each word’s  total feature frequency was at least 10. A the- 
saurus entry of size k for a target word w is then defined as the k most similar words to w.
    A large  number of distributional similarity measures have  been  proposed in the 
literature (see Weeds 2003 for a review) and comparing them is outside the scope of this 
work.  However, the study of Weeds  and  Weir (2005) provides interesting insights into 
what makes a “good” distributional similarity measure in the contexts of semantic simi- 
larity prediction and language modeling. In particular, weighting features by pointwise 
mutual information (Church and  Hanks 1989) appears to be beneficial.  The pointwise 
mutual information (I(w, f )) between a word and a feature is calculated as



I(w, f ) = log P( f |w)
P( f )



(3)



Intuitively, this means  that  the occurrence of a less-common feature is more  important 
in describing a word than  a more-common feature. For example, the verb  eat is more 
selective and tells us more about  the meaning of its arguments than the verb be.


13 We use sss for the semantic similarity between a WordNet sense and another word, the neighbor. We use
ssst for the semantic similarity between two WordNet senses, si and a sense of the neighbor (sx ).
14 From previous work  (McCarthy et al. 2004b), the value  of k has a minimal effect on finding the
predominant sense; however, we will continue experimentation with this in the future for using  our 
ranking score for estimating probability distributions of senses, because  a sufficiently large value  of k will 
be needed to include neighbors for rarer  senses.


565





    We chose to use the distributional similarity score described by Lin (1998a) because 
it is an unparameterized measure which  uses pointwise mutual information to weight 
features and  which  has been  shown (Weeds  2003) to be highly  competitive in making 
predictions of semantic similarity. This measure is based  on Lin’s information-theoretic 
similarity theorem (Lin 1997):

The similarity between A and B is measured by the ratio between the amount of 
information needed to state the commonality of A and B and the information needed to 
fully describe  what  A and B are.

In our  application, if T(w) is the set of features f such  that  I(w, f ) is positive, then  the 
similarity between two words, w and n, is
'Sf ∈T(w)∩T(n)  I(w, f ) + I(n, f )1


dss(w, n) =
f ∈T(w) I(w, f ) +


'Sf ∈T(n) I(n, f )


(4)



However, due to this choice of dss and the openness of the domain, we restrict ourselves 
to only considering words with a total feature frequency of at least 10. Weeds et al. (2005) 
do show  that  distributional similarity can be computed for lower  frequency words but 
this is using  a highly  specialized corpus of 400,000 words from the biomedical domain. 
Further, it has been shown (Weeds  et al. 2005; Weeds  and  Weir 2005) that  performance 
of Lin’s distributional similarity score decreases more significantly than other measures 
for low frequency nouns. We leave  the investigation of other  distributional similarity 
scores and the application to smaller  corpora as areas for further study.

4.2 The Semantic Similarity  Scores

WordNet is widely used  for research in WSD because  it is publicly available and  there 
are a number of associated sense-tagged corpora (Miller et al. 1993; Cotton  et al. 2001; 
Preiss and Yarowsky 2001; Mihalcea  and Edmonds 2004) available for testing  purposes. 
Several  semantic similarity scores  have  been  proposed that  leverage the  structure of
WordNet; for ssst  we experiment with  two  of these,  as implemented in the  WordNet
Similarity Package  (Patwardhan and Pedersen 2003).
    The WordNet Similarity Package implements a range of similarity scores. McCarthy 
et al. (2004b) experimented with  six of these  for the ssst used  in the prevalence score,
Equation (2). In the experiments reported here  we use the two  scores  that  performed 
best  in that  previous work.  We briefly  summarize them  here;  Patwardhan, Banerjee, 
and Pedersen (2003) give a more detailed discussion. The scores measure the similarity 
between two WordNet senses (s1 and s2).

lesk		This measure (Banerjee  and  Pedersen 2002) maximizes the number of overlap- 
ping words in the gloss, or definition, of the senses. It uses the glosses of semanti- 
cally related (according to WordNet) senses too. We use the default version of the 
measure in the package with  no normalizing for gloss length,  and  the default set 
of relations:

lesk(s1, s2) = |{W1 ∈ definition(s1)}| ∩ |{W2 ∈ definition(s2)}|	(5)

where definitions(s) is the gloss definition of sense  s concatenated with  the gloss 
definitions of the senses related to s where the relationships are defined by the de-


566






fault set of relations in the relations.dat file supplied with the WordNet Similarity 
package. W ∈ definition(s) is the set of words from the concatenated definitions.
jcn		This  measure (Jiang  and  Conrath 1997) uses  corpus data  to populate classes 
(synsets)  in the WordNet hierarchy with  frequency counts.  Each synset  is incre- 
mented with  the  frequency counts  (from  the  corpus) of all words belonging to 
that  synset,  directly or via the hyponymy relation. The frequency data  is used  to 
calculate  the “information content” (IC; Resnik 1995) of a class as follows:

                             IC(s) = −log(p(s))	(6) 
Jiang and Conrath specify a distance measure:
Djcn (s1, s2) = IC(s1) + IC(s2) − 2 × IC(s3)	(7)


where the third  class (s3) is the most informative, or most specific, superordinate 
synset  of the  two  senses  s1  and  s2. This  is converted to  a similarity measure 
in the  WordNet Similarity package by  taking  the  reciprocal as in Equation (8) 
(which  follows).  For this  reason,  the  jcn values  can get very  large  indeed when 
the distances are negligible, for example where the neighbor has a sense which  is 
a synonym. This is a motivation for our normalizing the sss in Equation (1).
                           jcn(s1, s2) = 1/Djcn (s1, s2)	(8) 
The IC data  required for the jcn measure can be acquired automatically from  raw
text. We used  raw data from the BNC to create the IC files. There are various parameters 
that  can be set in the WordNet Similarity Package  when  creating these  files; we used 
the RESNIK method of counting frequencies in WordNet (Resnik 1995), the stop  words 
provided with the package, and no smoothing.
The  lesk score  is applicable to  all parts  of speech,  whereas the  jcn is applicable
only  to nouns and  verbs  because  it relies  on IC counts  which  are obtained using  the 
hyponym links  and  these  only  exist for nouns and  verbs.15 However, we did  not  use 
jcn for verbs  because  in previous experiments (McCarthy et al. 2004c) the lesk measure 
outperformed jcn because  the structure of the hyponym hierarchy is very  shallow for 
verbs  and the measure is therefore considerably less informative for verbs  than  it is for 
nouns.



4.3 An Example

We illustrate the application of our measure with  an example. For star, if we set16  k = 4 
and  have  the dss for the previously given  neighbors as in the first row  of Table 6, and



15 For verbs these pointers actually encode  troponymy, which  is a particular kind of entailment relation, 
rather than hyponymy.
16 In this example, as before, we set k to 4 for the sake of brevity.

so the method would select celebrity  as the predominant sense.

5. Experimental Setup

5.1 The Distributional Thesauruses

The three  thesauruses used  in our first two experiments were  all created automatically 
from raw corpus data, based  either on grammatical relations between words computed 
by syntactic parsers or alternatively on word proximity relations.
    We created the first thesaurus, which we call BNC, from grammatical relation output 
produced by the RASP system  (Briscoe and  Carroll  2002) applied to the 90M words of 
the “written” portion of the British National Corpus (Leech 1992), for all polysemous 
nouns, verbs,  adjectives,  and  adverbs in WordNet. For each  word we  considered  co- 
occurring words in the grammatical contexts  listed in Table 7.
    In  the  first  two  experiments, we  also  use  two  further automatically computed 
distributional thesauruses, produced by Dekang Lin from 125M words of text from the 
Wall Street Journal, San Jose Mercury News, and AP Newswire, using  the same similarity 
measure. The thesauruses are publicly available.17 One was constructed based  on word


17 The thesauruses are available for download from http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/

similarities computed from syntactic dependencies produced by MINIPA R (Lin 1998b), 
and the other was constructed based on textual  proximity relationships between words. 
We refer below  to the original corpus as NEWSWIRE, and  these  two thesauruses as DEP 
and PROX, respectively. We restricted our experiments to the nouns in these thesauruses.
    Table 8 contains details  of the numbers of polysemous (according to WordNet 1.6) 
words contained in these  thesauruses, the number of words in SemCor  that  were  not 
found in these  thesauruses (NITH)  and  the  number of words in the  thesauruses that 
were not in SemCor (NISC).
    For  the  experiments described in  Sections  6.3 and  6.4 we  use  exactly  the  same 
method as that  proposed for the  BNC  thesaurus, however the data  source  is different 
and is described in those sections.


5.2 The Sense  Inventory

We use WordNet version 1.6 as the sense inventory for our first three experiments, and
1.7.1 for our last experiment.18
For  ssst  we  use  the  WordNet  Similarity Package  version 0.05 (Patwardhan and
Pedersen 2003).



18 We use 1.6 which  is a rather old version of WordNet so that we can directly evaluate on the SemCor data 
released with this version;  we also use it to enable comparison with the results of McCarthy et al. (2004a). 
We use WordNet 1.7.1 for the fourth experiment, because  this is the version that was used  for annotating 
the test data  in that experiment. We plan to move to more recent versions of WordNet and experiment 
with other sense inventories in the future.


569





6. Experiments

In this section  we describe four experiments using  our method for acquiring predomi- 
nant  sense information.
    The first experiment evaluates automatically acquired predominant senses  for all 
parts  of speech,  using  SemCor  as the  test  corpus. This extends previous work  which 
had only evaluated all PoS on Senseval-2  (Cotton  et al. 2001) and Senseval-3 (Mihalcea 
and Edmonds 2004) data. The SemCor corpus is composed of 220,000 words, in contrast 
to the 6 documents in the Senseval-2  and -3 English  all-words data  (10,000 words). We 
examine the effects of using  the two different semantic similarity scores that performed 
well  in previous work:  jcn is quick  to compute but  lesk has  the  advantage that  it is 
applicable to all PoS and  can  be implemented for any  dictionary with  sense  defini- 
tions.  We compare three  thesauruses: one is derived from  the  BNC  and  two  from  the 
NEWSWIRE corpus. The two from the NEWSWIRE corpus examine the requirement for 
a parser by contrasting results obtained when  the thesaurus is built  using  parsed data 
compared to a proximity approach. We contrast the results of the BNC  thesaurus with 
a simplified version of the prevalence score which  uses the number of the k neighbors 
closest  to a sense  for ranking without using  the dss and  without sharing the credit  for 
a neighbor between senses.  We also  perform an  error  analysis on  a random sample 
of words for which  a predominant sense  was  found that  differed from  that  given  by 
SemCor,  identifying and  giving  an indication of the frequencies of the main  sources  of 
error.
    The second  experiment is on nouns in the Senseval-2  all-words data,  again  using 
predominant senses  acquired using  each  of the  three  distributional thesauruses, but 
in this  experiment we explore  the  benefits  of an automatic first sense  heuristic when 
there  is inadequate data  in available resources. Although McCarthy et al. (2004c) show 
that on Senseval-2  and Senseval-3 test data  a first sense heuristic derived from SemCor 
outperforms the automatic method, we look at whether the method’s performance is 
relatively stronger on words for which  there  is little data  in SemCor.  This is important 
because,  as we have  shown in Table 5, low frequency words are used  often  in senses 
other than  the sense that is ranked first according to SemCor.
    In addition to the issue of lack of coverage of manually annotated resources, sense 
frequency will depend on the domain of the data.  In the third  experiment, we revisit 
some previous work  on noun  senses and domain (McCarthy et al. 2004a) using  corpora 
of news text about  sports and finance. Using distributional thesauruses computed from 
these  corpora and  a gold  standard  domain labeling of word senses  we  look  at  the 
potential for computing domain-specific predominant senses  for parts  of speech  other 
than  nouns.
   Continuing the  line  of research on  automatic acquisition of domain-specific pre- 
dominant senses,  the  fourth experiment compares results when  we  train  and  test  on 
domain-specific corpora, where the training data is (1) manually categorized for domain 
and from the same corpus as the gold-standard test data, and (2) where the training data 
is harvested automatically from another corpus which  is categorized automatically.

6.1 Experiment 1: All Parts of Speech

In this  experiment, we  evaluate the  accuracy  of automatically acquired predominant 
senses for all open class parts  of speech,  taking  SemCor as the gold standard. For nouns 
we use the semantic similarity measures lesk and jcn, and for other  parts  of speech,  lesk. 
We use the three distributional thesauruses BNC, DEP, and  PROX.


570





    The gold standard is derived from the Brown Corpus files publicly released as part 
of SemCor,  rather than  the  processed data  provided in the cntlist file in the WordNet 
distribution. The released SemCor  files contain  only  the  tagged data  from  the Brown 
Corpus and do not include data from The Red Badge of Courage. We use the released data 
rather than  that  in cntlist because  this includes the actual  tagged examples which  are 
marked for genre by the Brown files. We envisage the possibility of further experiments 
with  these  genre  markers. We only evaluate on instances where a single,  unique sense 
is supplied by the annotators. So, for example, we ignore  instances like the following 
with multiple wnsn values:

<wf cmd=done pos=NN lemma=tooth wnsn=3;1 lexsn=1:05:02::;1:08:00::>tooth</wf>

We also only evaluate on polysemous words (according to WordNet) having one sense 
in SemCor which  is more frequent than  any other,  and for which  both SemCor and our 
thesauruses have  at least  a minimal amount of data.  Specifically,  a word must  occur 
three  or more times in SemCor; it must  also occur in ten or more grammatical relations 
in the parsed version of the BNC and have neighbors in the distributional thesaurus, or 
be present in Dekang Lin’s thesaurus.19
    We evaluate on nouns, verbs, adjectives,  and adverbs separately, computing a num- 
ber  of accuracy  measures, both  type-based and  token-based. PSacc  is calculated over 
word types in SemCor which have one sense which occurs more than any other. It is the 
accuracy  of identifying the predominant sense in SemCor.  If the automatic ranking has 
a tie for the top ranked sense then we score that word as incorrect.20 So we have



PS	= |correcttyp |
|typesmf |   ×



100	(9)



where typesmf   are  the  types  in  SemCor  such  that  one  sense  is  more  frequent than 
any  other,  the  word has  occurred at  least  three  times  in  SemCor  and  has  an  entry
in the  thesaurus. |correcttyp | is the  number of these  where the  automatically acquired
predominant sense matches the first sense in SemCor.
PSacc BL is the predominant sense random baseline,  obtained as follows:




PSacc BL =


'S	 	1 	
∈	mf  |senses(w)|
|typesmf |



× 100	(10)



    WSDsc  is a token-based measure. It is the  WSD  accuracy  that  would be obtained 
by using  the  first sense  heuristic with  the  automatically acquired predominant sense 
information, in cases where there was a unique automatic top ranked sense:
correcttok |


WSDsc =  |
|SCtokensafs |


× 100	(11)





19 Although we do not evaluate words for which  there were no neighbors in the thesaurus, we could extend 
the thesaurus to include some of these by widening the range  of grammatical relations covered and 
compensating for some systematic PoS tagging errors.
20 If we exclude  these words with joint top ranking from the automatic method (precision rather than recall)
then we obtain  marginally higher accuracy  for the jcn measure but no difference for lesk.


571





where |correcttok | is the number of tokens  disambiguated correctly  out of the tokens  in
SemCor having an automatically acquired first sense (SCtokensafs ).
SC FS is the  WSD  accuracy  of the  SemCor  first sense  heuristic on the  same  set of
tokens (SCtokensafs ), which is the upper bound because the information it uses is derived 
from  the  test  data  itself.  RBL is the  random baseline  for the  WSD  task,  calculated by 
splitting the credit  for each token to be tagged in the test data  evenly  between all of the 
word’s  senses.




RBL =


'S	 	1 	
∈	afs   |senses(w)|
|SCtokensafs |



× 100	(12)



    The results are shown in Table 9. We examined differences between the semantic 
similarity measures (lesk and  jcn), the  BNC  and  DEP  thesauruses, and  the  DEP  and 
PROX thesauruses using  the χ2 test of significance with  one degree of freedom (Siegel 
and  Castellan 1988). None  of the differences between the different combinations of 
similarity measures and  thesauruses for the type-based measure PSacc  are significant. 
The differences between lesk and jcn are significant for the token-based measure WSDsc 
for both the BNC and  PROX thesauruses (both p < .001), however not when  comparing 
lesk and  jcn for the DEP  thesaurus. Although lesk is more  accurate than  jcn, at least on 
the  WSD  task,  jcn is much  faster  because  of the precompilation of IC in the  WordNet 
similarity package;  however, lesk has the additional benefit of being applicable to other 
parts  of speech.  The method gives  particularly good  results for adjectives,  given  that 
they  have  a similar  random baseline  to nouns. It does  not do so well for adverbs and 
verbs,  but  still performs well  above  the  random baseline  which  is low  for verbs  due 
to their  high  degree of polysemy. Given  that  the  first sense  heuristic from  SemCor  is 
particularly strong for adverbs, it is disappointing that  the automatic method does not 
perform as well  as it does  on  adjectives. One  possible  reason  for this  might  be that 
adverbs are often less strongly associated to the verbs that they modify than  adjectives 
are to the  nouns that  they  modify, so the  distributional thesaurus information is less 
reliable.  Another reason  may  be that  less data  are  available for adverbs, both  in the 
thesaurus and also in WordNet.

   Comparing the results for the DEP and the PROX thesauruses, we see that although 
there  is no  significant difference in PSacc  (with  either  lesk or jcn), there  is for WSDsc 
when using jcn (p < .001), but not when comparing the lesk values for these thesauruses. 
Even though the differences between jcn DEP and jcn PROX are significant, the absolute 
differences are nevertheless relatively small; this bodes  well for applying the automatic 
predominant sense  method to  languages less  well  resourced than  English,  because 
the  PROX  thesaurus was  produced without using  a parser. The differences in results 
between jcn BNC  and  jcn DEP  for nouns are  statistically significant (p < .001).21  The 
better  accuracy  with  DEP  may  be because  the  NEWSWIRE  corpus is larger  than  the 
BNC. We intend to investigate the effects of corpus size in the future. The differences in 
results between lesk BNC and lesk DEP for nouns are not significant.


6.1.1 Results Using  Simplified  Prevalence Score. A simple  variation of our method is just to 
associate  each neighbor with just one sense and use the number of neighbors associated 
with  a sense  for the  prevalence score.  This  gives  a modified version of Equation (1)
where each sense si  ∈ senses(w) is assigned a score as follows:


Simplified Prevalence Score(w, si ) = |{nj  ⊂ Nw } :  arg max (sss(sk , nj )) = si |	(13)
sk ∈senses(w)


where




sss(sk , nj ) = 	max
sx ∈senses(nj )


ssst (sk , sx )	(14)




    For the example in Table 6, celebrity  would get the top score of 2 (due  to it having 
the highest sss for actor and  footballer), celestial body would get a score of 1 (due  to its 
sss with planet), shape would get 1 (due to circle), and zodiac would obtain  a Simplified 
Prevalence Score of 0 because  it does not have the highest sss for any of the neighbors.
    As the results from Table 10 show,  we do not get such good  results with  this score. 
This supports our  intuition that  a combination of both  the  number of neighbors and 
their  distributional similarity scores  is important for determining predominance. The 
rest of the article gives results and analysis for our original prevalence score as given in 
Equation (1).


6.1.2 Error Analysis. We took a random sample of 80 words that occurred more than five 
times in SemCor, 20 words for each PoS, from those where the automatically identified 
predominant sense  was  different from  the  SemCor  first sense  when  using  the lesk sss 
and  BNC thesaurus and  our ranking score as defined in Equation (1) (i.e., the data

21 The coverage of the SemCor data by the DEP  and  PROX  thesauruses is slightly  lower  than that of the
BNC-derived thesaurus due to mismatches in spelling and capitalization and also probably because  the
NEWSWIRE corpus is narrower in genre and domain than the BNC.

manually inspected the data  for each  of the words to find  the source  of the problem. 
We did  not  have  the  (substantial) resources that  would be required to sense  tag  all 
occurrences of these words in the BNC to see what their actual first senses were. Instead, 
we examined the parses, grammatical relations, and  sense definitions for the words to 
see why  the AUTO  FS was ranked above  the SemCor  FS. We found the following main 
types  of error:22

corpora 	The difference appears to be due  to genuine divergence between the  BNC 
and SemCor. For this error type we looked  at the BNC parses  to see if the acquired 
predominant sense  was clearly  due  to differences in the corpus data.  There  may 
be other  errors  that  should have  been  assigned this category, but  without access 
to sense  tagged BNC  data  we could  not be sure  of this, so we used  this category 
conservatively. An example of this error  is the adjective  solid which  has the good 
quality  first sense  in the Brown  files in SemCor,  but  the firm sense  according to 
our BNC automatic ranking.
related    The automatic predominant sense is closely related to the SemCor first sense.
Although many  word senses  are related to some extent,  the category was picked 
where a close relationship seemed to be the main  cause of the error.  An example 
is the noun  straw which  has two  senses  in WordNet 1.6, fibre used  for hats and 
fodder and plant material. The SemCor FS was the former  whereas our AUTO  FS 
was the latter.
competing   Two or more  related senses  are ranked highly  but they are overtaken by 
an unrelated sense. For example, the ranking and scores for the noun  transmission 
are:

The act of sending a message sense  is overtaken by the gears sense  because  the 
credit  from shared distributional neighbors is split between it and  the communi- 
cation sense.
neighbors	There  are not many  neighbors related to the sense. There  can be various 
reasons for this, such as the sense having restricted contexts  of occurrence or only 
a small  number of near  synonyms existing  for the  sense.  An example of this  is 
the  adjective  live where the SemCor  FS unrecorded  sense  seems  to occur  in the 
BNC  corpus more  than  the alive  sense; there  are plenty  of grammatical relations 
pertaining to this sense, but there are few distributional neighbors near in meaning 
to unrecorded.23
spurious  similarity    The WordNet similarity scores were misled  by spurious relation- 
ships  to neighbors; this  can  occur  in dense  areas  such  as the  “physical object” 
region  of the noun  hyponym hierarchy. An example of this is the verb tap which 
has neighbors push and  press which  are related to the AUTO  FS (solicit)  as well as 
the SemCor FS (strike lightly).

    The results of the  error  analysis are  shown in Table  11. The analysis shows  that 
differences between the training (BNC) and  testing  (SemCor)  corpora are not a major 
source  of  error.  Although SemCor  itself  (the  released files  from  the  Brown  corpus 
comprising only  200,000 words) is not large  enough to build  a thesaurus with  entries 
for a reasonable portion of the words, we did  build  a thesaurus from the entire  Brown 
corpus (1 million  words) to see the  effect  of corpus data.  The  results are  compared 
to those  from  the  BNC  in Table  12 on  the  set  of words which  had  thesaurus entries 
in the  Brown  data  (to make  the  results more  comparable, because  the  corpora are of 
such  different sizes).  We also show  the  average results for 10 random selections of a
1 million  word random sample of the BNC. To do this we randomly selected  1  th of the 
tuples.24 The differences in the WSDsc for the BNC   1   sample and the Brown corpus are 
significant ( p < .01 on the χ2 ), but the differences in PSacc  are not significant. Although 
the entire  BNC produced better  results than  the Brown data,  this is undoubtedly due  to 
the difference in size of the corpus. Taking  a comparably sized  sample, the results are
slightly  better  from Brown which  is the corpus from which  SemCor is taken.
    For nouns, it was apparent that in two cases less-prevalent senses were receiving a 
higher ranking simply  because  the credit  for some  neighbors associated with  another 
meaning was  split  between related senses  (error  type  competing). This  was  not  ob- 
served for other  parts  of speech,  possibly because  the AUTO  FS was rarely  unrelated to 
the SemCor FS.
    There  were  some  problems arising  from  spurious  similarity.  One possible  source 
of such  problems is due  to the ambiguity of the  neighbor; in the  future we will look 
at reducing this  source  of error  by removing neighbors which  have  a value  for sx  in 
Equation (2) which  is not  the same  as that  preferred by the other  senses  of the target 
word (w). For adverbs, all the cases that  were  categorized as spurious  similarity  were 
also noted to be related to the SemCor  FS, though they were not categorized as related 
as this was not considered the primary cause of the error.
    The analysis was  hardest for verbs.  Verbs are on average highly  polysemous, and 
often have  senses  that  are related. Furthermore, the structure of the WordNet verb tro- 
ponym hierarchy is very shallow compared to the noun  hyponymy hierarchy, so there

and australian weekly.

are more possibilities for spurious similarities from overlap of glosses. So, although we 
tried  to identify the main  problem source,  for verbs  the problems usually arose  from a 
combination of factors and the relatedness of the senses was usually one of these.
   Relatedness of senses and fine-grained distinctions are major sources  of error. There 
have  been  various attempts to group WordNet senses  both  manually and  automati- 
cally (Agirre  and  Lopez  de Lacalle 2003; McCarthy 2006; Palmer,  Dang,  and  Fellbaum
2007). Indeed, McCarthy demonstrated that  distributional and  semantic similarity can 
be  used  for  relating word senses  and  that  such  methods increase  accuracy  of  first 
sense heuristics, including the automatic method proposed here. WSD is improved with 
coarser-grained inventories but  ultimately, performance depends on  the  application. 
For example, the noun  bar has 11 senses  in WordNet 1.6. These include the pub sense 
as well as the counter sense  and  these  are related to a certain  extent.  One might  want 
to group them  when  acquiring predominant senses, but there  may be situations where 
they should be distinguished. For example, if one were to ask a robot to “go to the bar ” 
one would hope it could use the context to go get the drinks rather than  replying that it 
is already there! Even in cases where fine-grained distinctions are ultimately required, it 
may be helpful to have a coarse-grained prior  and then use contextual features to tease 
apart  subtle  sense distinctions.
    From our error  analysis, the problem of semantically isolated senses  (identified as 
neighbors) was not a major source of error, but still causes some problems. One possible 
remedy might  be to identify these cases by looking  for neighbors which  relate strongly 
to a sense  which  none  of the other  neighbors relate  to and  weighting the contribution 
from these neighbors more. This may however give rise to further errors  because  of the 
noise introduced by focusing on individual neighbors. We will explore  such directions 
in future work.

    In this  experiment we  did  not  assign  any  credit  for  near  misses.  In many  cases 
of error  the  SemCor  FS nonetheless received a high  prevalence score.  In the  future 
we hope  to use the score for probability estimation, and  combine this with  contextual 
information for WSD as in related work  by Lapata  and  Brew (2004) and  Chan  and  Ng 
(2005).

6.2 Experiment 2: Frequency and the SemCor First Sense  Heuristic

In the  previous section  we  described an  evaluation of the  accuracy  of automatically 
acquired predominant sense information. We carried out the evaluation with respect  to 
SemCor  in order  to have  as much  test  data  as possible.  To obtain  reasonably reliable 
gold-standard  first-sense data  and  first-sense heuristic upper bounds, we limited the 
evaluation to words occurring at least  three  times  in SemCor.  Clearly  this  scenario  is 
unrealistic. For many  words, and particularly for nouns, there is very little or no data in 
SemCor; Table 2 shows  that  81.9% of nouns (excluding multiwords) listed  in WordNet 
do not occur at all in SemCor.  Thus, even for English,  which  has substantial manually 
sense-tagged resources, coverage is severely limited for many  words.
    For a more  realistic  comparison of automatic and  manual heuristics, we therefore 
now change  to a different test corpus, the Senseval-2 English all-words task data set. We 
focus on nouns and evaluate using  all words regardless of their frequencies in SemCor. 
We examine the  effect of frequency in SemCor  on performance of a SemCor-derived 
heuristic in comparison to results from our automatic method on the same words. Our 
hypothesis is that although automatically acquired predominant sense information may 
not outperform first-sense data obtained from a hand-tagged resource over all words in 
a text, the information may well be more accurate for low frequency items.
We use a mapping between different WordNet versions25 (Daude´ , Padro´ , and Rigau
2000) to obtain  the Senseval-2 all words noun  data (originally distributed with 1.7 sense 
numbers) with 1.6 sense numbers. As well as examining the performance of our method 
in contrast to the  SemCor  heuristic, we  calculate  an  upper bound for this  using  the 
first sense heuristic from the Senseval-2  all-words data  itself. This is obtained for nouns 
with  two or more occurrences in the Senseval-2  data  and  where one sense occurs  more 
than  any  of the  others.  We calculate  type,  precision, and  recall,  using  this  Senseval-2 
first-sense as  the  gold  standard. The  recall  measure is the  same  as  PSacc described 
previously, except  that  we include items  which  do  not  have  entries  in the  thesaurus, 
scoring  them  incorrect. Precision only  includes items  where there  is a sense  ranked 
higher than any other for that word with the prevalence score, that is, it does not include 
items with a joint automatic ranking. We also calculate  token precision and recall (WSD). 
These measures relate  to WSDsc , but  again,  recall includes words not in the thesaurus 
which  are scored  incorrect, and precision does not include items with a joint automatic 
ranking. We also separately compute WSD  precision for words not  in SemCor  (NISC). 
The results are shown in Table 13.26
    The automatically acquired predominant sense results (the first six lines of results 
in the table) are approaching the SemCor-derived results (third  line from the bottom of 
the table). The NISC results are particularly encouraging, but with  the caveat  that there 
are  only  17 such  words in the  data.  The precision for these  items  is higher than  the

26 Note that these figures  are lower  than those of McCarthy et al. (2004a) in a similar  experiment because 
the evaluation here is only on polysemous words.

overall  figure.  This is because  the nouns involved are less frequent so tend  to be less 
polysemous and  consequently have  a higher random baseline.  There  are a few nouns 
that  are not  in the  automatic ranking, but  this  is due  to the  fact that  neighbors were 
not  collected  for these  nouns in the  thesaurus because  of tagging or parser errors  or 
the  particular set  of grammatical relations used.  It should be possible  to extend  the 
range  of grammatical relations, or use proximity-based relations, so that neighbors can 
be obtained in these cases. It would also be possible  to assign  some credit  in the case of 
joint top ranked senses to increase  coverage.
    Looking  at Table 13 in more  detail,  it seems  to be the case that  although the  BNC 
thesaurus does well in identifying the first sense of a word (the type results), the PROX 
and  DEP  thesauruses from  the  NEWSWIRE  corpus return better  WSD  results when 
used  with  the jcn measure. This is possibly because  jcn works  well for more  frequent 
items  due  to its incorporation of frequency information, and  the NEWSWIRE  corpus 
has  more  data  for  frequent words, although coverage is not  as good  as the  BNC  as 
seen  by the  bigger  differences in precision and  recall  and  the  figures  in Table  8. The 
lower  coverage may  be due  to the  narrower domain and  genre  of the  NEWSWIRE 
corpus, though spelling and  capitalization differences probably also account for some 
differences.
    Table  14 shows  results on  the  Senseval-2  nouns for  the  best  similarity measure 
and  thesaurus combinations in  Table  13 for  nouns at  or  below  various frequencies 
in SemCor.  (The differences between the  DEP  and  PROX  thesauruses are negligible at 
frequencies of 10 or below,  so for those we report only the results for DEP.) As we 
anticipated, for low  frequency words the  automatic methods do  give  more  accurate 
predominant sense information than SemCor. The low number of test items at frequency 
five or less means  that results for jcn with the BNC thesaurus are not significantly better 
when  compared with  SemCor  ( p = .05); however the lesk WSD results are significantly
better ( p < .01 for the ≤ 1 threshold and p < .05 for the ≤ 5 threshold). On the whole, we
see that the automatic method, using  either  jcn or lesk and any of the three thesauruses,
tend  to give better  results than  SemCor on nouns which  have low coverage in SemCor.
    Figures  2 and  3 show  the precision for type  and  token  (WSD) evaluation where the 
items have a frequency at or below given thresholds in SemCor. Although the manually

produced SemCor  first-sense heuristic outperforms the automatic methods over all the 
test items (see the “all” results in Table 14), when  items are below a frequency threshold 
of five the  automatic methods give  better  results. Indeed, as the  threshold is moved 
up  to 20 and  even  30, more  nouns are  covered, and  the  automatic methods are  still 
comparable and in some cases competitive with the SemCor heuristic.


6.3 Experiment 3: The Influence of Domain

In this  experiment, we investigate the  potential of the  automatic ranking method for 
computing predominant senses  with  respect  to  particular domains. We  have  previ- 
ously  demonstrated that  the  method produces intuitive domain-specific models for 
nouns (McCarthy et al. 2004a), and that these can be more accurate than first senses de- 
rived from SemCor for words salient to a domain (Koeling, McCarthy, and Carroll 2005). 
Here we investigate the behavior for other parts  of speech, using a similar  experimental 
setup  to that  of McCarthy et al. That work  used  the subject field codes (SFC) (Magnini


and  Cavaglia`


2000)27  as  a  
gold  standard. 
In  SFC  the  
Princeton 
English  
WordNet  is


augmented with  some  domain labels.  Every  synset  in WordNet’s sense  inventory is 
annotated with at least one domain label, selected  from a set of about  200 labels. These 
labels are organized in a tree structure. Each synset  of WordNet 1.6 is labeled  with  one 
or more  labels. The label factotum is assigned if any other  is inadequate. The first level 
consists  of five main  categories (e.g., doctrines and  social science) and  factotum.doctrines



27 More recently  referred to as WordNet Domains (WN -DOMAINS).

has  subcategories such  as art, religion, and  psychology. Some  subcategories are  further 
divided in subcategories (e.g., dance, music, and theatre are subcategories of art).
   McCarthy et al. (2004a) used  two domain-specific corpora for input to the method 
for finding predominant senses.  The corpora were  obtained from  the Reuters  Corpus, 
Volume  1 (RCV1; Rose, Stevenson, and Whitehead 2002) using  the Reuters topic codes. 
The two domain-specific corpora were:

SPORTS (Reuters topic code GSPO), 9.1 million  words
FINANCE  (Reuters topic codes ECAT and  MCAT), 32.5 million  words

    In  that  work  we  produced sense  rankings for  a set  of 38 nouns which  have  at 
least one synset  with an economy SFC label and one with a sport SFC label. We then 
demonstrated that  there  were  more  sport labels  assigned to the  predominant  senses 
acquired from  the SPORTS corpus and  more  economy labels assigned to those  from  the 
FINANCE   corpus. The  predominant senses  from  both  domains had  a similarly high 
percentage of factotum (domain-independent) labels. We reproduce the results here  (in 
Figure  4) for ease of reference, and  for comparison with  other  results presented in this 
section.  The y-axis in this figure  shows  the percentage of the predominant sense labels 
for these 38 nouns that have the SFC label indicated by the x-axis.
    We envisaged running the  same  experiment with  verbs,  adjectives,  and  adverbs, 
although we  suspected that  these  would show  less  domain-specific tendencies and 
there  would be fewer  candidate words to work  with.  The SFC labels  for all senses  of 
polysemous words (excluding multiwords) in the various parts  of speech  are shown in 
Table 15. We see from the distribution of factotum labels across  the parts  of speech  that 
nouns are certainly the PoS most likely to be influenced by domain.
    To produce results like Figure  4 for each PoS, we needed words having at least one 
synset  with  a sport label and  one with  an economy label. There  were  20 such  verbs  but

only  two  adjectives and  no  adverbs meeting this  condition. We therefore performed 
the experiment only with  verbs.  To do this we used  the SPORTS and  FINANCE  corpora 
as before,  computing thesauruses for verbs  using  the  grammatical relations specified 
in Table 7. The results for the distribution of domain labels of the predominant senses

acquired from the SPORTS and FINANCE  corpora are shown in Figure 5. We see the same 
tendency for sport labels  for predominant senses  from  the  SPORTS corpus and  economy 
labels  for  the  predominant senses  from  the  FINANCE   corpus, but  the  relationship  is 
less marked compared with  nouns because  of the high  proportions of factotum senses 
in both  corpora for verbs.  We believe  that  acquisition of domain-specific predominant 
senses  should be focused on those  words which  show  domain-specific tendencies. We 
hope  to put  more  work  into  automatic detection of these  tendencies using  indicators 
such as domain salience and words that have different sense rankings in a given domain 
compared to the BNC (as discussed by Koeling, McCarthy, and Carroll  2005).

6.4 Experiment 4: Domain-Specific Predominant  Sense  Acquisition

In the final set of experiments we evaluate the acquired predominant senses for domain- 
specific corpora. The first of the two experiments was reported by Koeling,  McCarthy, 
and  Carroll  (2005), but  we extend  it by the second  experiment reported subsequently. 
Because there are no publicly available domain-specific manually sense-tagged corpora, 
we created our own gold standard. The two chosen domains (SPORTS and FINANCE) and 
the domain-neutral corpus (BNC) are the same  as we used  in the previous experiment. 
We selected  40 words and  we sampled (randomly) sentences containing these  words 
from the three  corpora and  asked  annotators to choose  the correct  sense  for the target 
words. The set consists  of 17 words which  have at least one sense assigned an economy 
domain label and  at least one sense  assigned a sports label: club, manager, record, right, 
bill, check, competition,   conversion,  crew, delivery, division, fishing, reserve,  return, score, 
receiver,  running; eight  words that  are  particular salient  in  the  SPORTS  domain: fan, 
star, transfer, striker, goal, title, tie, coach; eight  words that  are  particular salient  in the

FINANCE  domain: package, chip, bond, market, strike, bank, share, target;  and  seven  words 
that  are equally  salient  in both  domains: will, phase, half, top, performance, level, country. 
Koeling, McCarthy, and Carroll (2005) give further details of the construction of the gold 
standard.
    In the first experiment, we train  on a corpus of documents with manually assigned 
domain labels (i.e., sub-corpora of the Reuters  corpus, see Section 6.3), and  we test on 
data  from  the  same  source.  In a second  experiment we build  a text classifier,  use  the 
text classifier to obtain  SPORTS and FINANCE  corpora (using  general newswire text from 
the English  Gigaword Corpus; Graff 2003) and  test on the gold-standard data  from the 
Reuters corpus. The second  experiment eliminates issues  about  dependencies between 
training and  test data  and  will shed  light  on the question of how  robust the acquired 
predominant sense method is with respect  to noise in the input data.  At the same time, 
the second  experiment paves  the way towards creating predominant sense inventories 
for any conceivable domain.


6.4.1 Experiment Using Hand-Labeled Data. In this section  we focus on the predominant 
sense evaluation of the experiments described by Koeling, McCarthy, and Carroll (2005). 
After running the predominant sense finding algorithms on the raw text of the two do- 
main corpora (SPORTS and FINANCE) and the domain-neutral corpus (BNC), we evaluate 
the accuracy  of performing WSD on the sample of 40 words purely with  the first sense 
heuristic using  all nine combinations of training and test corpora. The results (as given 
in Table 16) are compared with  a random baseline  (“Random BL”)28 and  the accuracy 
using  the first sense heuristic from SemCor (“SemCor  FS”).29
    The results in Table 16 show that the best results are obtained when the predominant 
senses  are acquired using  the appropriate domain (i.e., test and  training data  from the 
same  domain). Moreover, when  trained on the  domain-relevant corpora, the random 
baseline  as well as the baseline  provided by SemCor  are comfortably beaten.  It can be 
observed from  these  results that  apparently the  BNC  is more  similar  to the  FINANCE 
corpus than it is to the SPORTS corpus. The results for the SPORTS domain lag behind the 
results for the FINANCE  domain by almost  6 percentage points.  This could  be because

of the smaller  amount of training data  available (32M words versus 9M words), but it 
could also be an artifact  of this particular selection  of words.

6.4.2 Experiment Using Automatically  Classified Data. Although the previous experiment 
shows that it is possible  to acquire domain-specific predominant senses successfully, the 
usefulness of doing  this will be far greater if there  is no need  to classify  corpora with 
respect  to domain by hand. There  is no such  thing  as a standard domain specification 
because  the definition of a domain depends on user  and  application. It would be 
advantageous if we could automatically obtain a user-/application-specific corpus from 
which  to acquire predominant senses.
    In this  section  we  describe an  experiment where we  build  a text  classifier  using 
WordNet as  a sense  inventory and  the  SFC  domain extension (see  Section  6.3). We 
extracted bags of domain-specific words from WordNet for all the defined domains by 
collecting  all the word senses (synsets)  and corresponding glosses associated with each 
domain label. These  bags  of words are the fingerprints for the domains and  we used 
them  to train a Support Vector Machine  (SVM) text classifier using  TwentyOne.30
    The classifier  distinguishes between 48 classes  (the  first and  second  levels  of the 
SFC  hierarchy). When  a  document is evaluated by  the  classifier,  it  returns a  list  of 
all the classes  (domains) it recognizes and  an associated confidence  score reflecting  the 
certainty that the document belongs  to that particular domain. We classified 10 months’ 
worth of data from the English Gigaword Corpus using this classifier and assigned each 
document to the corpus belonging to the highest scoring  class of the classifier ’s output. 
The level of confidence was ignored at this stage.
    This  resulted in  a SPORTS  corpus comprising about  11M words and  a FINANCE 
corpus of about  27M words. The predominant sense finding algorithm was run  on the 
raw text of these two corpora and  we followed exactly the same evaluation strategy as 
in the  previous section.  The results are summarized in Table 17 and  are  very  similar 
to those  based  on hand-labeled corpora. Again,  the best results are obtained when  test 
and  training data  are  derived from  the  same  domain. The  FINANCE–FINANCE  result 
is slightly  worse,  but  is still well  above  both  Random and  the  SemCor  baseline.  The 
SPORTS–SPORTS result  has  slightly  improved over  the  result  reported in the  previous

section. The reason  for these differences may well be because  the FINANCE  corpus used 
for this experiment is smaller and the SPORTS corpus is slightly  larger than  those used  in 
the hand-labeled experiment.
   Automatically classifying documents inherently introduces noise  in  the  training 
corpora. This experiment to test the robustness of our method for finding predominant 
senses  suggests that it deals  well with  the noise. Further experiments that take the 
confidence levels of the classifier  into account will allow  us to create  corpora with  less 
noise and will allow us to find the right balance between corpus size and corpus quality.

7. Conclusions

In this article  we have  argued that  information on the predominant sense  of words is 
important, and  that  it is desirable to be able to infer this automatically from unlabeled 
text. We presented a number of evaluations investigating various facets of a previously 
proposed method for automatically acquiring this information (McCarthy et al. 2004a). 
The evaluations extend  ones  in previous publications in a number of ways:  they  use 
larger,  balanced test data  sets, and  they compare alternative semantic similarity scores 
and  distributional thesauruses derived from  different corpora and  based  on different 
kinds  of relations. We also looked  in detail  at areas  where the method performs well 
and also where it does not, and carried out a manual error analysis to identify the types 
of mistakes it makes.
Our main results are:

•	The predominant sense acquisition method produces promising results 
overall  for all open  class parts  of speech,  when  evaluated on SemCor, a 
large balanced corpus.
•	The highest accuracies are for nouns and adjectives;  overall  accuracy  for 
verbs is lower, but they have the lowest  random baseline;  adverbs have the 
lowest  average polysemy but gains over the random baseline  are lower 
than for other  PoS.
•	Using a thesaurus computed from proximity-based relations produces 
almost  as good results as using  an otherwise identical one computed from 
syntactic dependency-based relations.
•	Lesk’s semantic similarity score (Banerjee and Pedersen 2002, lesk) 
produces particularly good results for nouns which  have low corpus 
frequencies; Jiang and Conrath’s (1997, jcn) score does well on higher 
frequency words.31
•	For low frequency nouns in SemCor, the method, using  any combination 
of automatically acquired thesaurus and semantic similarity score that we 
tried, produces more accurate predominant sense information than 
SemCor. In particular, for nouns with a frequency of five or less (12.9% of 
the polysemous nouns in the Senseval-2  data)  it outperforms the SemCor 
first sense heuristic. As the threshold is increased, the SemCor first sense



31 The lesk score has wider applicability than  jcn since it can be applied to all parts  of speech.  It can also be 
used  with any sense inventory which  has textual  definitions for its senses even if the inventory does not 
contain  WordNet-like semantic relations.


586





heuristic becomes  more competitive, but some of the automatic methods 
are still outperforming it for nouns occurring 20 or fewer times in SemCor.
•	Nouns show  a stronger tendency for domain-specific meanings than other 
parts  of speech,  but predominant senses for verbs acquired automatically 
with respect  to domain-specific corpora also correlate with the appropriate 
domain labeling for those senses.
•	Predominant senses acquired using  domain-specific corpora outperform 
those from SemCor ina WSD task, for a selection  of nouns, using  corpora 
consisting of either  hand-classified or automatically-classified documents.

8. Further Work

We are continuing to work  on automatic ranking of word senses for WSD. Our next step 
will be to use the numeric values  of sense  prevalence scores  to compare the skews  in 
the  distributions of word senses  across  different corpora and  see if this  enables  us to 
detect automatically words for which a domain- or genre-specific ranking is warranted. 
Looking  at skews  should also  help  in predicting words for which  contextual WSD  is 
likely  to be particularly powerful, for example when  more  than  one  sense  is scored 
as  being  highly  prevalent. In  such  situations we  will  combine our  method with  an 
approach to unsupervised context-based WSD  which  uses  the  collocates  of the  distri- 
butional neighbors associated with each of the senses as contextual features.
    Our  error  analysis shows  that  many  errors  in identifying predominant senses  are 
caused by the sense  distinctions in WordNet being  particularly fine-grained. We have 
recently  (Koeling  and  McCarthy 2007) evaluated our  method on  the  coarse-grained 
English all words task at SemEval (Navigli, Litkowski, and Hargraves 2007). We will fol- 
low work  on finding relationships between WordNet senses  to induce coarser-grained 
classes  (McCarthy 2006), and  on automatic induction of senses  (Pantel  and  Lin 2002) 
and  adapt our method to acquire prevalence rankings for these. The granularity of the 
inventory will  depend on  the  application and  we  plan  to apply rankings over  such 
inventories for WSD within the context of a task, such as lexical substitution (McCarthy 
and Navigli 2007).
    To  date  we  have  only  applied our  methods to  English.  We  plan  to  apply our 
approach to other languages for which  sense tagged resources of the size of SemCor are 
not available. Given  the good  results with  Lin’s proximity based  thesaurus we believe 
our  method should work  even  for languages which  do not  have  high  quality parsers 
available.
