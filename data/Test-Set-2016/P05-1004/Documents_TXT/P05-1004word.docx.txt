Abstract

The limited coverage of lexical-semantic re- 
sources is a significant problem for NLP sys- 
tems  which  can  be  alleviated  by  automati- 
cally classifying the unknown words.   Su- 
persense tagging assigns unknown nouns one 
of 26 broad semantic categories used by lex- 
icographers  to  organise  their  manual  inser- 
tion into WORDNET.  Ciaramita and Johnson 
(2003) present a tagger which uses synonym 
set glosses as annotated training examples. We 
describe an unsupervised approach, based on 
vector-space similarity, which does not require 
annotated examples but significantly outper- 
forms their tagger. We also demonstrate the use 
of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for 
calculating vector-space semantic similarity.


1   Introduction

Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful 
to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce,
2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), 
to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and 
question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001). In par- 
ticular, WORDNET (Fellbaum, 1998) has significantly in- 
fluenced research in NLP.
  Unfortunately, these resource are extremely time- 
consuming and labour-intensive to manually develop and 
maintain, requiring considerable linguistic and domain 
expertise.   Lexicographers cannot possibly keep pace 
with language evolution:  sense distinctions are contin- 
ually made and merged, words are coined or become 
obsolete, and technical terms migrate into the vernacu- 
lar.  Technical domains, such as medicine, require sepa- 
rate treatment since common words often take on special 
meanings, and a significant proportion of their vocabu- 
lary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary.   Bur- 
gun and Bodenreider (2001) compared an alignment of


WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found 
only a very small degree of overlap.   Also, lexical- 
semantic resources suffer from:

bias towards concepts and senses from particular topics.
Some specialist topics are better covered in WORD- 
NET than others, e.g. dog has finer-grained distinc- 
tions than cat and worm although this does not re- 
flect finer distinctions in reality;

limited coverage of infrequent words and senses.  Cia- 
ramita and Johnson (2003) found that common 
nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every
8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus. By WORDNET 2.0, 
coverage has improved but the problem of keeping 
up with language evolution remains difficult.

consistency when classifying similar words into cate- 
gories. For instance, the WORDNET lexicographer 
file for ionosphere (location) is different to exo- 
sphere and stratosphere (object), two other layers 
of the earth’s atmosphere.

These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or 
semi-automatic methods for the creation and mainte- 
nance of lexical-semantic resources.   Broad semantic 
classification is currently used by lexicographers to or- 
ganise the manual insertion of words into WORDNET, 
and is an experimental precursor to automatically insert- 
ing words directly into the WORDNET hierarchy.  Cia- 
ramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging 
and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses 
WORDNET’s hierarchical structure to create many anno- 
tated training instances from the synset glosses.
  This paper describes an unsupervised approach to su- 
persense tagging that does not require annotated sen- 
tences.  Instead, we use vector-space similarity to re- 
trieve a number of synonyms for each unknown common 
noun. The supersenses of these synonyms are then com- 
bined to determine the supersense.  This approach sig- 
nificantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the 
same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6 and 1.7.1.

2	Supersenses

There are 26 broad semantic classes employed by lex- 
icographers in the initial phase of inserting words into 
the WORDNET hierarchy, called lexicographer files (lex- 
files). For the noun hierarchy, there are 25 lex-files and a 
file containing the top level nodes in the hierarchy called 
Tops.  Other syntactic classes are also organised using 
lex-files: 15 for verbs, 3 for adjectives and 1 for adverbs. 
Lex-files form a set of coarse-grained sense distinc- 
tions within WORDNET. For example, company appears 
in the following lex-files in WORDNET 2.0: group, which 
covers company in the social, commercial and troupe 
fine-grained senses; and state, which covers companion- 
ship.  The names and descriptions of the noun lex-files 
are shown in Table 1.   Some lex-files map directly to 
the top level nodes in the hierarchy, called unique begin- 
ners, while others are grouped together as hyponyms of 
a unique beginner (Fellbaum, 1998, page 30). For exam- 
ple, abstraction subsumes the lex-files attribute, quantity,
relation, communication and time.
  Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call the noun lex-file 
classes supersenses.  There are 11 unique beginners in 
the WORDNET noun hierarchy which could also be used 
as supersenses.  Ciaramita (2002) has produced a mini- 
WORDNET by manually reducing the WORDNET hier- 
archy to 106 broad categories.  Ciaramita et al. (2003) 
describe how the lex-files can be used as root nodes in a 
two level hierarchy with the WORDNET synsets appear-



ing directly underneath.
  Other alternative sets of supersenses can be created by 
an arbitrary cut through the WORDNET hierarchy near 
the top, or by using topics from a thesaurus such as 
Roget’s (Yarowsky, 1992).  These topic distinctions are 
coarser-grained than WORDNET senses, which have been 
criticised for being too difficult to distinguish even for 
experts.  Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the 
key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses. 
They suggest that supersense tagging is similar to named 
entity recognition, which also has a very small set of cat- 
egories with similar granularity (e.g. location and person) 
for labelling predominantly unseen terms.
  Supersense tagging can provide automated or semi- 
automated assistance to lexicographers adding words to 
the WORDNET hierarchy. Once this task is solved suc- 
cessfully,  it may be possible to insert words directly 
into the fine-grained distinctions of the hierarchy itself. 
Clearly, this is the ultimate goal, to be able to insert 
new terms into lexical resources, extending the structure 
where necessary.  Supersense tagging is also interesting 
for many applications that use shallow semantics, e.g. in- 
formation extraction and question answering.

3   Previous Work

A considerable amount of research addresses structurally 
and statistically manipulating the hierarchy of WORD- 
NET and the construction of new wordnets using the con- 
cept structure from English. For lexical FreeNet, Beefer- 
man (1998) adds over 350 000 collocation pairs (trigger 
pairs) extracted from a 160 million word corpus of broad- 
cast news using mutual information. The co-occurrence 
window was 500 words which was designed to approxi- 
mate average document length.
  Caraballo and Charniak (1999) have explored deter- 
mining noun specificity from raw text.  They find that 
simple frequency counts are the most effective way of 
determining the parent-child ordering, achieving 83% ac- 
curacy over types of vehicle, food and occupation.  The 
other measure they found to be successful was the en- 
tropy of the conditional distribution of surrounding words 
given the noun.  Specificity ordering is a necessary step 
for building a noun hierarchy.  However, this approach 
clearly cannot build a hierarchy alone. For instance, en- 
tity is less frequent than many concepts it subsumes. This 
suggests it will only be possible to add words to an ex- 
isting abstract structure rather than create categories right 
up to the unique beginners.
  Hearst and Schu¨ tze (1993) flatten WORDNET into 726 
categories using an algorithm which attempts to min- 
imise the variance in category size. These categories are 
used to label paragraphs with topics, effectively repeat- 
ing Yarowsky’s (1992) experiments using the their cat- 
egories rather than Roget’s thesaurus.  Schu¨ tze’s (1992)


WordSpace system was used to add topical links, such 
as between ball, racquet and game (the tennis problem). 
Further, they also use the same vector-space techniques 
to label previously unseen words using the most common 
class assigned to the top 20 synonyms for that word.
  Widdows (2003) uses a similar technique to insert 
words into the WORDNET hierarchy.  He first extracts 
synonyms for the unknown word using vector-space sim- 
ilarity measures based on Latent Semantic Analysis and 
then searches for a location in the hierarchy nearest to 
these synonyms.  This same technique as is used in our 
approach to supersense tagging.
  Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) implement a super- 
sense tagger based on the multi-class perceptron classi- 
fier (Crammer and Singer, 2001), which uses the standard 
collocation, spelling and syntactic features common in 
WSD and named entity recognition systems. Their insight 
was to use the WORDNET glosses as annotated training 
data and massively increase the number of training in- 
stances using the noun hierarchy. They developed an effi- 
cient algorithm for estimating the model over hierarchical 
training data.

4   Evaluation

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) propose a very natural 
evaluation for supersense tagging:  inserting the extra 
common nouns that have been added to a new version 
of WORDNET.  They use the common nouns that have 
been added to WORDNET 1.7.1 since WORDNET 1.6 and 
compare this evaluation with a standard cross-validation 
approach that uses a small percentage of the words from 
their WORDNET 1.6 training set for evaluation.  Their 
results suggest that the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set is sig- 
nificantly harder because of the large number of abstract 
category nouns, e.g. communication and cognition, that 
appear in the 1.7.1 data, which are difficult to classify.
  Our evaluation will use exactly the same test sets as 
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003). The WORDNET 1.7.1 test 
set consists of 744 previously unseen nouns, the majority 
of which (over 90%) have only one sense. The WORD- 
NET 1.6 test set consists of several cross-validation sets 
of 755 nouns randomly selected from the BLLIP train- 
ing set used by Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).   They 
have kindly supplied us with the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set 
and one cross-validation run of the WORDNET 1.6 test 
set. Our development experiments are performed on the 
WORDNET 1.6 test set with one final run on the WORD- 
NET 1.7.1 test set. Some examples from the test sets are 
given in Table 2 with their supersenses.

5   Corpus

We have developed a 2 billion word corpus, shallow- 
parsed with a statistical NLP pipeline, which is by far the

(NANTC); the NANTC Supplement (NANTS); and the 
ACQUAINT Corpus. The components and their sizes 
including punc- tuation are given in Table 3.  The LDC 
has recently re- leased the English Gigaword corpus 
which includes most of the corpora listed above.

Table 3: 2 billion word corpus statistics

  We have tokenized the text using the Grok-
OpenNLP tokenizer (Morton, 2002) and split the 
sentences using MXTerminator (Reynar and 
Ratnaparkhi, 1997).   Any sentences less than 3 words 
or more than 100 words long were rejected, along with 
sentences containing more than
5 numbers or more than 4 brackets, to reduce noise. 
The rest of the pipeline is described in the next section.

6   Semantic 
Similarity

Vector-space models of similarity are based on the 
distri- butional hypothesis that similar words appear in 
similar contexts.  This hypothesis suggests that 
semantic simi- larity can be measured by comparing 
the contexts each word appears in. In vector-space 
models each headword is represented by a vector of 
frequency counts record- ing the contexts that it 
appears in.  The key parameters are the context 
extraction method and the similarity mea- sure used to 
compare context vectors.  Our approach to


vector-space similarity is based on the SEXTANT system 
described in Grefenstette (1994).
  Curran and Moens (2002b) compared several context 
extraction methods and found that the shallow pipeline 
and grammatical relation extraction used in SEXTANT 
was both extremely fast and produced high-quality re- 
sults.   SEXTANT  extracts relation tuples (w, r, wt ) for 
each noun, where w is the headword, r is the relation type 
and wt is the other word. The efficiency of the SEXTANT 
approach makes the extraction of contextual information 
from over 2 billion words of raw text feasible.  We de- 
scribe the shallow pipeline in detail below.
  Curran and Moens (2002a) compared several differ- 
ent similarity measures and found that Grefenstette’s 
weighted JACCARD measure performed the best:


R E L AT I O N 	D E S C R I P T I O N
adj	noun–adjectival modifier relation
dobj	verb–direct object relation 
iobj	verb–indirect object relation 
nn	noun–noun modifier relation
nnprep	noun–prepositional head relation
subj	verb–subject relation

Table 4: Grammatical relations from SEXTANT


against the CELEX lexical database (Minnen et al., 2001)
– and is very efficient, analysing over 80 000 words per 
second. morpha often maintains sense distinctions be- 
tween singular and plural nouns; for instance:  specta- 
cles is not reduced to spectacle, but fails to do so in 
other cases: glasses is converted to glass. This inconsis-


L min(wgt(w1 , ∗r , ∗wI ), wgt(w2 , ∗r , ∗wI ))
L max(wgt(w1 , ∗r , ∗wI ), wgt(w2 , ∗r , ∗wI ))



(1)


tency is problematic when using morphological 
analysis to smooth vector-space models. 
However, morphological smoothing still 
produces better results in practice.


where wgt(w, r, wt ) is the weight function for relation
(w, r, wt ).   Curran and Moens (2002a) introduced the 
TTEST weight function, which is used in collocation ex- 
traction. Here, the t-test compares the joint and product 
probability distributions of the headword and context:



6.3   Grammatical Relation Extraction
After the raw text has been POS  tagged and chunked, 
the grammatical relation extraction algorithm is run over 
the chunks.  This consists of five passes over each sen- 
tence that first identify noun and verb phrase heads and


p(w, r, wt ) − p(∗, r, wt )p(w, ∗, ∗)
 p(∗, r, wt )p(w, ∗, ∗)


(2)


then collect grammatical relations between 
each common noun and its modifiers and 
verbs. A global list of gram- matical 
relations generated by each pass is 
maintained


where ∗ indicates a global sum over that element of the
relation tuple.   JACCARD  and TTEST  produced better
quality synonyms than existing measures in the literature, 
so we use Curran and Moen’s configuration for our super- 
sense tagging experiments.

6.1   Part of Speech Tagging and Chunking
Our implementation of SEXTANT uses a maximum en- 
tropy POS tagger designed to be very efficient, tagging 
at around 100 000 words per second (Curran and Clark,
2003), trained on the entire Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.,
1994). The only similar performing tool is the Trigrams
‘n’ Tags tagger (Brants, 2000) which uses a much simpler 
statistical model.  Our implementation uses a maximum 
entropy chunker which has similar feature types to Koel- 
ing (2000) and is also trained on chunks extracted from 
the entire Penn Treebank using the CoNLL 2000 script. 
Since the Penn Treebank separates PPs and conjunctions 
from NPs, they are concatenated to match Grefenstette’s 
table-based results, i.e. the SEXTANT always prefers noun 
attachment.

6.2   Morphological Analysis
Our implementation uses morpha, the Sussex morpho- 
logical analyser (Minnen et al., 2001), which is imple- 
mented using lex grammars for both affix splitting and 
generation. morpha has wide coverage – nearly 100%


across the passes. The global list is used to determine if a 
word is already attached. Once all five passes have been 
completed this association list contains all of the noun- 
modifier/verb pairs which have been extracted from the 
sentence. The types of grammatical relation extracted by 
SEXTANT are shown in Table 4.  For relations between 
nouns (nn and nnprep), we also create inverse relations 
(wt , rt , w) representing the fact that wt  can modify w. 
The 5 passes are described below.
Pass 1: Noun Pre-modifiers
This pass scans NPs,  left to right,  creating adjectival 
(adj) and nominal (nn) pre-modifier grammatical rela- 
tions (GRs) with every noun to the pre-modifier’s right, 
up to a preposition or the phrase end. This corresponds to 
assuming right-branching noun compounds. Within each 
NP only the NP and PP heads remain unattached.
Pass 2: Noun Post-modifiers
This pass scans NPs, right to left, creating post-modifier 
GRs between the unattached heads of NPs and PPs.  If 
a preposition is encountered between the noun heads, a 
prepositional noun (nnprep) GR is created, otherwise an 
appositional noun (nn) GR is created.  This corresponds 
to assuming right-branching PP  attachment.  After this 
phrase only the NP head remains unattached.
Tense Determination
The rightmost verb in each VP is considered the head. A


VP is initially categorised as active. If the head verb is a 
form of be then the VP becomes attributive.  Otherwise, 
the algorithm scans the VP from right to left: if an auxil- 
iary verb form of be is encountered the VP becomes pas- 
sive; if a progressive verb (except being) is encountered 
the VP becomes active.
  Only the noun heads on either side of VPs remain 
unattached.  The remaining three passes attach these to 
the verb heads as either subjects or objects depending on 
the voice of the VP.
Pass 3: Verb Pre-Attachment
This pass scans sentences, right to left, associating the 
first NP head to the left of the VP with its head. If the VP 
is active, a subject (subj) relation is created; otherwise, 
a direct object (dobj) relation is created.  For example, 
antigen is the subject of represent.
Pass 4: Verb Post-Attachment
This pass scans sentences, left to right, associating the 
first NP or PP head to the right of the VP with its head. 
If the VP was classed as active and the phrase is an NP 
then a direct object (dobj) relation is created.  If the VP 
was classed as passive and the phrase is an NP  then a 
subject (subj) relation is created. If the following phrase 
is a PP then an indirect object (iobj) relation is created. 
The interaction between the head verb and the preposi- 
tion determine whether the noun is an indirect object of 
a ditransitive verb or alternatively the head of a PP that is 
modifying the verb. However, SEXTANT always attaches 
the PP to the previous phrase.
Pass 5: Verb Progressive Participles
The final step of the process is to attach progressive verbs 
to subjects and objects (without concern for whether they 
are already attached). Progressive verbs can function as 
nouns, verbs and adjectives and once again a na¨ıve ap- 
proximation to the correct attachment is made. Any pro- 
gressive verb which appears after a determiner or quan- 
tifier is considered a noun.  Otherwise, it is a verb and 
passes 3 and 4 are repeated to attach subjects and objects. 
Finally, SEXTANT collapses the nn, nnprep and adj re- 
lations together into a single broad noun-modifier gram- 
matical relation. Grefenstette (1994) claims this extractor 
has a grammatical relation accuracy of 75% after manu-
ally checking 60 sentences.

7   Approach

Our approach uses voting across the known supersenses 
of automatically extracted synonyms, to select a super- 
sense for the unknown nouns.  This technique is simi- 
lar to Hearst and Schu¨ tze (1993) and Widdows (2003). 
However, sometimes the unknown noun does not appear 
in our 2 billion word corpus, or at least does not appear 
frequently enough to provide sufficient contextual infor- 
mation to extract reliable synonyms. In these cases, our


SUFFIX	EXAMPLE	SUPERSENSE
-ness	remoteness	attribute
-tion, -ment	annulment	act
-ist, -man	statesman	person
-ing, -ion	bowling	act
-ity	viscosity	attribute
-ics, -ism	electronics	cognition
-ene, -ane, -ine	arsine	substance
-er, -or, -ic, -ee, -an	mariner	person
-gy	entomology	cognition

Table 5: Hand-coded rules for supersense guessing


fall-back method is a simple hand-coded classifier which 
examines the unknown noun and makes a guess based on 
simple morphological analysis of the suffix. These rules 
were created by inspecting the suffixes of rare nouns in 
WORDNET 1.6. The supersense guessing rules are given 
in Table 5.  If none of the rules match, then the default 
supersense artifact is assigned.
  The problem now becomes how to convert the ranked 
list of extracted synonyms for each unknown noun into 
a single supersense selection.  Each extracted synonym 
votes for its one or more supersenses that appear in 
WORDNET 1.6. There are many parameters to consider:
• how many extracted synonyms to use;
• how to weight each synonym’s vote;
• whether unreliable synonyms should be filtered out;
• how to deal with polysemous synonyms.
The experiments described below consider a range of op- 
tions for these parameters. In fact, these experiments are 
so quick to run we have been able to exhaustively test 
many combinations of these parameters. We have exper- 
imented with up to 200 voting extracted synonyms.
  There are several ways to weight each synonym’s con- 
tribution. The simplest approach would be to give each 
synonym the same weight.  Another approach is to use 
the scores returned by the similarity system.  Alterna- 
tively, the weights can use the ranking of the extracted 
synonyms.  Again these options have been considered 
below.  A related question is whether to use all of the 
extracted synonyms, or perhaps filter out synonyms for 
which a small amount of contextual information has been 
extracted, and so might be unreliable.
  The final issue is how to deal with polysemy. Does ev- 
ery supersense of each extracted synonym get the whole 
weight of that synonym or is it distributed evenly between 
the supersenses like Resnik (1995)? Another alternative 
is to only consider unambiguous synonyms with a single 
supersense in WORDNET.
  A disadvantage of this similarity approach is that it re- 
quires full synonym extraction, which compares the un- 
known word against a large number of words when, in

fact, we want to calculate the similarity to a small number 
of supersenses.  This inefficiency could be reduced sig- 
nificantly if we consider only very high frequency words, 
but even this is still expensive.



8   Results

We have used the  WORDNET  1.6 test set to experi- 
ment with different parameter settings and have kept the 
WORDNET 1.7.1 test set as a final comparison of best 
results with Ciaramita and Johnson (2003). The experi- 
ments were performed by considering all possible config- 
urations of the parameters described above.
  The following voting options were considered for each 
supersense of each extracted synonym:  the initial vot- 
ing weight for a supersense could either be a constant 
(IDENTITY) or the similarity score (SCORE) of the syn- 
onym.  The initial weight could then be divided by the 
number of supersenses to share out the weight (SHARED). 
The weight could also be divided by the rank (RANK) to 
penalise supersenses further down the list. The best per- 
formance on the 1.6 test set was achieved with the SCORE 
voting, without sharing or ranking penalties.
  The extracted synonyms are filtered before contribut- 
ing to the vote with their supersense(s). This filtering in- 
volves checking that the synonym’s frequency and num- 
ber of contexts are large enough to ensure it is reliable. 
We have experimented with a wide range of cutoffs and 
the best performance on the 1.6 test set was achieved us- 
ing a minimum cutoff of 5 for the synonym’s frequency 
and the number of contexts it appears in.
  The next question is how many synonyms are consid- 
ered. We considered using just the nearest unambiguous 
synonym, and the top 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 syn- 
onyms. All of the top performing configurations used 50 
synonyms. We have also experimented with filtering out 
highly polysemous nouns by eliminating words with two, 
three or more synonyms.  However, such a filter turned 
out to make little difference.
  Finally, we need to decide when to use the similarity 
measure and when to fall-back to the guessing rules. This 
is determined by looking at the frequency and number of 
attributes for the unknown word.  Not surprisingly, the 
similarity system works better than the guessing rules if 
it has any information at all.
  The results are summarised in Table 6.  The accuracy 
of the best-performing configurations was 68% on the


















Table 7: Breakdown of results by supersense


WORDNET 1.6 test set with several other parameter com- 
binations described above performing nearly as well. On 
the previously unused WORDNET 1.7.1 test set, our accu- 
racy is 63% using the best system on the WORDNET 1.6 
test set.  By optimising the parameters on the 1.7.1 test 
set we can increase that to 64%, indicating that we have 
not excessively over-tuned on the 1.6 test set. Our results 
significantly outperform Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) 
on both test sets even though our system is unsupervised. 
The large difference between our 1.6 and 1.7.1 test set 
accuracy demonstrates that the 1.7.1 set is much harder.
  Table 7 shows the breakdown in performance for each 
supersense. The columns show the number of instances 
of each supersense with the precision, recall and f-score 
measures as percentages. The most frequent supersenses 
in both test sets were person, attribute and act.  Of the 
frequent categories, person is the easiest supersense to 
get correct in both the 1.6 and 1.7.1 test sets, followed 
by food, artifact and substance.  This is not surprising 
since these concrete words tend to have very fewer other 
senses, well constrained contexts and a relatively high 
frequency. These factors are conducive for extracting re- 
liable synonyms.
  These results also support Ciaramita and Johnson’s 
view that abstract concepts like communication, cognition 
and state are much harder. We would expect the location


supersense to perform well since it is quite concrete, but 
unfortunately our synonym extraction system does not 
incorporate proper nouns, so many of these words were 
classified using the hand-built classifier. Also, in the data 
from Ciaramita and Johnson all of the words are in lower 
case, so no sensible guessing rules could help.

9   Other Alternatives and Future Work

An alternative approach worth exploring is to create con- 
text vectors for the supersense categories themselves and 
compare these against the words. This has the advantage 
of producing a much smaller number of vectors to com- 
pare against. In the current system, we must compare a 
word against the entire vocabulary (over 500 000 head- 
words), which is much less efficient than a comparison 
against only 26 supersense context vectors.
  The question now becomes how to construct vectors 
of supersenses. The most obvious solution is to sum the 
context vectors across the words which have each su- 
persense.  However, our early experiments suggest that 
this produces extremely large vectors which do not match 
well against the much smaller vectors of each unseen 
word.   Also, the same questions arise in the construc- 
tion of these vectors.  How are words with multiple su- 
persenses handled? Our preliminary experiments suggest 
that only combining the vectors for unambiguous words 
produces the best results.
  One solution would be to take the intersection between 
vectors across words for each supersense (i.e. to find the 
common contexts that these words appear in). However, 
given the sparseness of the data this may not leave very 
large context vectors. A final solution would be to con- 
sider a large set of the canonical attributes (Curran and 
Moens, 2002a) to represent each supersense. Canonical 
attributes summarise the key contexts for each headword 
and are used to improve the efficiency of the similarity 
comparisons.
  There are a number of problems our system does not 
currently handle. Firstly, we do not include proper names 
in our similarity system which means that location enti- 
ties can be very difficult to identify correctly (as the re- 
sults demonstrate).  Further, our similarity system does 
not currently incorporate multi-word terms.  We over- 
come this by using the synonyms of the last word in 
the multi-word term. However, there are 174 multi-word 
terms (23%) in the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set which we 
could probably tag more accurately with synonyms for 
the whole multi-word term.  Finally, we plan to imple- 
ment a supervised machine learner to replace the fall- 
back method, which currently has an accuracy of 37% 
on the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set.
  We intend to extend our experiments beyond the Cia- 
ramita and Johnson (2003) set to include previous and


more recent versions of WORDNET to compare their dif- 
ficulty, and also perform experiments over a range of cor- 
pus sizes to determine the impact of corpus size on the 
quality of results.
  We would like to move onto the more difficult task 
of insertion into the hierarchy itself and compare against 
the initial work by Widdows (2003) using latent seman- 
tic analysis.   Here the issue of how to combine vec- 
tors is even more interesting since there is the additional 
structure of the WORDNET inheritance hierarchy and the 
small synonym sets that can be used for more fine-grained 
combination of vectors.

10   Conclusion

Our application of semantic similarity to supersense tag- 
ging follows earlier work by Hearst and Schu¨ tze (1993) 
and Widdows (2003).  To classify a previously unseen 
common noun our approach extracts synonyms which 
vote using their supersenses in WORDNET 1.6. We have 
experimented with several parameters finding that the 
best configuration uses 50 extracted synonyms, filtered 
by frequency and number of contexts to increase their re- 
liability. Each synonym votes for each of its supersenses 
from WORDNET 1.6 using the similarity score from our 
synonym extractor.
  Using this approach we have significantly outper- 
formed the supervised multi-class perceptron Ciaramita 
and Johnson (2003).  This paper also demonstrates the 
use of a very efficient shallow NLP pipeline to process 
a massive corpus.  Such a corpus is needed to acquire 
reliable contextual information for the often very rare 
nouns we are attempting to supersense tag.  This appli- 
cation of semantic similarity demonstrates that an unsu- 
pervised methods can outperform supervised methods for 
some NLP tasks if enough data is available.
