<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">We are given a source string fJ 1 = f1:::fj :::fJ of length J, which is to be translated into a target string eI 1 = e1:::ei:::eI of length I. Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability</S>
<S sid ="19" ssid = "3">(1), Pr(eI 1) is the language model, which is a trigram language model in this case.</S>
<S sid ="20" ssid = "4">For the translation model Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1), we go on the assumption that each source word is aligned to exactly one target word.</S
<S sid ="27" ssid = "11">What is important and is not expressed by the notation is the so-called coverage constraint: each source position j should be &apos;hit&apos; exactly once by the path of the inverted alignment bI 1 = b1:::bi:::bI . Using the inverted alignments in the maximum approximation</S>
<S sid ="39" ssid = "2">In order to handle the necessary word reordering as an optimization problem within our dynamic programming approach, we describe a solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) which is based on dynamic programming (Held, Karp, 1962).</S>
<S sid ="46" ssid = "9">The algorithm works due to the fact that not all permutations of cities have to be considered explicitly.</S><S sid ="47" ssid = "10">For a given partial hypothesis (C; j), the order in which the cities in C have been visited can be ignored (except j), only the score for the best path reaching j has to be stored.</S>
<S sid ="58" ssid = "21">The type of alignment we have considered so far requires the same length for source and target sentence, i.e. I = J. Evidently, this is an unrealistic assumption, therefore we extend the concept of inverted alignments as follows: When adding a new position to the coverage set C, we might generate either Æ = 0 or Æ = 1 new target words.</S>
<S sid ="94" ssid = "57">When translating the sentence monotonically from left to right, the translation of the German finite verb &apos;kann&apos;, which is the left verbal brace in this case, is postponed until the German noun phrase &apos;mein Kollege&apos; is translated, which is the subject of the sentence.</S>
ssid = "102">This approach leads to a search procedure with complexity O(E3 J4).</S>
<S sid ="136" ssid = "99">A dynamic programming recursion similar to the one in Eq. 2 is evaluated.</S><S sid ="165" ssid = "25">We apply a beam search concept as in speech recognition.</S>
<S sid ="139" ssid = "102">This approach leads to a search procedure with complexity O(E3 J4).</S>

<S sid ="169" ssid = "29">For each source word f, the list of its possible translations e is sorted according to p(fje) puni(e), where puni(e) is the unigram probability of the English word e. It is suÆcient to consider only the best 50 words.</S>
<S sid ="179" ssid = "39">For our demonstration system, we typically use the pruning threshold t0 = 5:0 to speed up the search by a factor 5 while allowing for a small degradation in translation accuracy.</S>
