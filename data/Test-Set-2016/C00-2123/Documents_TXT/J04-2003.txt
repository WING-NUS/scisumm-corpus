In statistical machine translation, correspondences between the words in the source and the
target language are learned from parallel corpora, and often little or no linguistic knowledge is
used to structure the underlying models. In particular, existing statistical systems for machine
translation often treat different inflected forms of the same lemma as if they were independent of one
another. The bilingual training data can be better exploited by explicitly taking into account the
interdependencies of related inflected forms. We propose the construction of hierarchical lexicon
models on the basis of equivalence classes of words. In addition, we introduce sentence-level
restructuring transformations which aim at the assimilation of word order in related sentences.
We have systematically investigated the amount of bilingual training data required to maintain
an acceptable quality of machine translation. The combination of the suggested methods for
improving translation quality in frameworks with scarce resources has been successfully tested:
We were able to reduce the amount of bilingual training data to less than 10% of the original
corpus, while losing only 1.6% in translation quality. The improvement of the translation results
is demonstrated on two German-English corpora taken from the Verbmobil task and the Nespole!
task.
1. Introduction
The statistical approach to machine translation has proved successful in various com-
parative evaluations since its revival by the work of the IBM research group more
than a decade ago. The IBM group dispensed with linguistic analysis, at least in its
earliest publications. Although the IBM group finally made use of morphological and
syntactic information to enhance translation quality (Brown et al 1992; Berger et al
1996), most of today?s statistical machine translation systems still consider only surface
forms and use no linguistic knowledge about the structure of the languages involved.
In many applications only small amounts of bilingual training data are available
for the desired domain and language pair, and it is highly desirable to avoid at least
parts of the costly data collection process. The main objective of the work reported in
this article is to introduce morphological knowledge in order to reduce the amount
of bilingual data necessary to sufficiently cover the vocabulary expected in testing.
This is achieved by explicitly taking into account the interdependencies of related
inflected forms. In this work, a hierarchy of equivalence classes at different levels of
abstraction is proposed. Features from those hierarchy levels are combined to form
hierarchical lexicon models, which can replace the standard probabilistic lexicon used

in most statistical machine translation systems. Apart from the improved coverage,
the proposed lexicon models enable the disambiguation of ambiguous word forms by
means of annotation with morpho-syntactic tags.
1.1 Overview
The article is organized as follows. After briefly reviewing the basic concepts of the
statistical approach to machine translation, we discuss the state of the art and related
work as regards the incorporation of morphological and syntactic information into
systems for natural language processing. Section 2 describes the information provided
by morpho-syntactic analysis and introduces a suitable representation of the analyzed
corpus. Section 3 suggests solutions for two specific aspects of structural difference,
namely, question inversion and separated verb prefixes. Section 4 is dedicated to hi-
erarchical lexicon models. These models are able to infer translations of word forms
from the translations of other word forms of the same lemma. Furthermore, they use
morpho-syntactic information to resolve categorial ambiguity. In Section 5, we describe
how disambiguation between different readings and their corresponding translations
can be performed when no context is available, as is typically the case for conven-
tional electronic dictionaries. Section 6 provides an overview of our procedure for
training model parameters for statistical machine translation with scarce resources.
Experimental results are reported in Section 7. Section 8 concludes the presentation
with a discussion of the achievements of this work.
1.2 Statistical Machine Translation
In statistical machine translation, every target language string eI1 = e1 ? ? ? eI is assigned
a probability Pr(eI1) of being a valid word sequence in the target language and a
probability Pr(eI1|f
J
1) of being a translation for the given source language string f
J
1 =
f1 ? ? ? fJ. According to Bayes? decision rule, the optimal translation for f J1 is the target
string that maximizes the product of the target language model Pr(eI1) and the string
translation model Pr(f J1 |eI1). Many existing systems for statistical machine translation
(Garc??a-Varea and Casacuberta 2001; Germann et al 2001; Nie?en et al 1998; Och,
Tillmann, and Ney 1999) implement models presented by Brown, Della Pietra, Della
Pietra, and Mercer (1993): The correspondence between the words in the source and
the target strings is described by alignments that assign target word positions to each
source word position. The probability that a certain target language word will occur
in the target string is assumed to depend basically only on the source words aligned
with it.
1.3 Related Work
1.3.1 Morphology. Some publications have already dealt with the treatment of mor-
phology in the framework of language modeling and speech recognition: Kanevsky,
Roukos, and Sedivy (1997) propose a statistical language model for inflected languages.
They decompose word forms into stems and affixes. Maltese and Mancini (1992) re-
port that a linear interpolation of word n-grams, part of speech n-grams, and lemma
n-grams yields lower perplexity than pure word-based models. Larson et al (2000)
apply a data-driven algorithm for decomposing compound words in compounding
languages as well as for recombining phrases to enhance the pronunciation lexicon
and the language model for large-vocabulary speech recognition systems.
As regards machine translation, the treatment of morphology is part of the analysis
and generation step in virtually every symbolic machine translation system. For this
purpose, the lexicon should contain base forms of words and the grammatical category,
183
Nie?en and Ney SMT with Scarce Resources
subcategorization features, and semantic information in order to enable the size of the
lexicon to be reduced and in order to account for unknown word forms, that is, word
forms not present explicitly in the dictionary.
Today?s statistical machine translation systems build upon the work of P. F. Brown
and his colleagues at IBM. The translation models they presented in various papers
between 1988 and 1993 (Brown et al 1988; Brown et al 1990; Brown, Della Pietra, Della
Pietra, and Mercer 1993) are commonly referred to as IBM models 1?5, based on the
numbering in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993). The underlying
(probabilistic) lexicon contains only pairs of full forms. On the other hand, Brown
et al (1992) had already suggested word forms be annotated with morpho-syntactic
information, but they did not perform any investigation on the effects.
1.3.2 Translation with Scarce Resources. Some recent publications, like Al-Onaizan
et al (2000), have dealt with the problem of translation with scarce resources. Al-
Onaizan et al report on an experiment involving Tetun-to-English translation by dif-
ferent groups, including one using statistical machine translation. Al-Onaizan et al
assume the absence of linguistic knowledge sources such as morphological analyzers
and dictionaries. Nevertheless, they found that the human mind is very well capable
of deriving dependencies such as morphology, cognates, proper names, and spelling
variations and that this capability was finally at the basis of the better results produced
by humans compared to corpus-based machine translation. The additional information
results from complex reasoning, and it is not directly accessible from the full-word-
form representation in the data.
This article takes a different point of view: Even if full bilingual training data
are scarce, monolingual knowledge sources like morphological analyzers and data for
training the target language model as well as conventional dictionaries (one word
and its translation[s] per entry) may be available and of substantial usefulness for
improving the performance of statistical translation systems. This is especially the case
for more-inflecting major languages like German. The use of dictionaries to augment
or replace parallel corpora has already been examined by Brown, Della Pietra, Della
Pietra, and Goldsmith (1993) and Koehn and Knight (2001), for instance.
2. Morpho-syntactic Information
A prerequisite for the methods for improving the quality of statistical machine trans-
lation described in this article is the availability of various kinds of morphological
and syntactic information. This section describes the output resulting from morpho-
syntactic analysis and explains which parts of the analysis are used and how the
output is represented for further processing.
2.1 Description of the Analysis Results
For obtaining the required morpho-syntactic information, the following analyzers for
German and English were applied: gertwol and engtwol for lexical analysis and gercg
and engcg for morphological and syntactic disambiguation. For a description of the
underlying approach, the reader is referred to Karlsson (1990). Tables 1 and 2 give
examples of the information provided by these tools.
2.2 Treatment of Ambiguity
The examples in Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate the capability of the tools to disambiguate
among different readings: For instance, they infer that the word wollen is a verb in the
indicative present first-person plural form. Without any context taken into account,

wollen has other readings. It can even be interpreted as derived from an adjective
with the meaning ?made of wool.? The inflected word forms on the German part of
the Verbmobil (cf. Section 7.1.1) corpus have on average 2.85 readings (1.86 for the
English corpus), 58% of which can be eliminated by the syntactic analyzers on the
basis of sentence context.
Common bilingual corpora normally contain full sentences, which provide enough
context information for ruling out all but one reading for an inflected word form. To
reduce the remaining uncertainty, preference rules have been implemented. For in-
stance, it is assumed that the corpus is correctly true-case-converted beforehand, and
as a consequence, non-noun readings of uppercase words are dropped. Furthermore,
indicative verb readings are preferred to subjunctive or imperative. In addition, some
simple domain-specific heuristics are applied. The reading ?plural of Esse? for the
German word form Essen, for instance, is much less likely in the domain of appoint-
ment scheduling and travel arrangements than the readings ?proper name of the town
Essen? or the German equivalent of the English word meal. As can be seen in Table 3,
the reduction in the number of readings resulting from these preference rules is fairly
small in the case of the Verbmobil corpus.
The remaining ambiguity often lies in those parts of the information which are
not used or which are not relevant to the translation task. For example, the analyzers
cannot tell accusative from dative case in German, but the case information is not
essential for the translation task (see also Table 4). Section 2.4 describes a method

By selecting relevant tags 1.06 1.01
By resorting to unambiguous part 1.00 1.00
for selecting morpho-syntactic tags considered relevant for the translation task, which
results in a further reduction in the number of readings per word form to 1.06 for
German and 1.01 for English. In these rare cases of ambiguity it is admissible to resort
to the unambiguous parts of the readings, that is, to drop all tags causing mixed
interpretations. Table 3 summarizes the gradual resolution of ambiguity.
The analysis of conventional dictionaries poses some special problems, because
they do not provide enough context to enable effective disambiguation. For handling
this special situation, dedicated methods have been implemented; these are presented
in Section 5.1.
2.3 The Lemma-Tag Representation
A full word form is represented by the information provided by the morpho-syntactic
analysis: from the interpretation gehen verb indicative present first singular, that
is, the base form plus part of speech plus the other tags, the word form gehe can be
restored. It has already been mentioned that the analyzers can disambiguate among
different readings on the basis of context information. In this sense, the information
inherent in the original word forms is augmented by the disambiguating analyzer.
This can be useful for choosing the correct translation of ambiguous words. Of course,
these disambiguation clues result in an enlarged vocabulary. The vocabulary of the new
representation of the German part of the Verbmobil corpus, for example, in which full
word forms are replaced by base form plus morphological and syntactic tags (lemma-
tag representation), is one and a half times as large as the vocabulary of the original
corpus. On the other hand, the information in the lemma-tag representation can be
accessed gradually and ultimately reduced: For example, certain instances of words
can be considered equivalent. This fact is used to better exploit the bilingual training
data along two directions: detecting and omitting unimportant information (see Section
2.4) and constructing hierarchical translation models (see Section 4). To summarize,
the lemma-tag representation of a corpus has the following main advantages: It makes
context information locally available, and it allows information to be explicitly accessed
at different levels of abstraction.
2.4 Equivalence Classes of Words with Similar Translation
Inflected word forms in the input language often contain information that is not rel-
evant for translation. This is especially true for the task of translating from a more
inflecting language like German into English, for instance: In parallel German/English
corpora, the German part contains many more distinct word forms than the English
part (see, for example, Table 5). It is useful for the process of statistical machine trans-
lation to define equivalence classes of word forms which tend to be translated by
the same target language word: The resulting statistical translation lexicon becomes

and case (nominative, dative, accusative)

smoother, and the coverage is considerably improved. Such equivalence classes are
constructed by omitting those items of information from morpho-syntactic analysis
which are not relevant for translation.
The lemma-tag representation of the corpus helps to identify the unimportant
information. The definition of relevant and unimportant information, respectively, de-
pends on many factors like the languages involved, the translation direction, and the
choice of the models. We detect candidates for equivalence classes of words automat-
ically from the probabilistic lexicon trained for translation from German to English.
For this purpose, those inflected forms of the same base form which result in the same
translation are inspected. For each set of tags T, the algorithm counts how often an
additional tag t1 can be replaced with a certain other tag t2 without effect on the trans-
lation. As an example, let T = ?blau-adjective?, t1 =?masculine? and t2 =?feminine?.
The two entries (?blau-adjective-masculine?|?blue?) and (?blau-adjective-feminine?|?blue?)
are hints for detecting gender as nonrelevant when translating adjectives into English.
Table 4 lists some of the most frequently identified candidates to be ignored while
translating: The gender of nouns is irrelevant for their translation (which is straight-
forward, as the gender of a noun is unambiguous), as are the cases nominative, dative,
accusative. (For the genitive forms, the translation in English differs.) For verbs the
candidates number and person were found: The translation of the first-person singular
form of a verb, for example, is often the same as the translation of the third-person
plural form. Ignoring (dropping) those tags most often identified as irrelevant for
translation results in the building of equivalence classes of words. Doing so results in
a smaller vocabulary, one about 65.5% the size of the vocabulary of the full lemma-
tag representation of the Verbmobil corpus, for example?it is even smaller than the
vocabulary of the original full-form corpus.
The information described in this section is used to improve the quality of statis-
tical machine translation and to better exploit the available bilingual resources.
3. Treatment of Structural Differences
Difference in sentence structure is one of the main sources of errors in machine trans-
lation. It is thus promising to ?harmonize? the word order in corresponding sentences.
The presentation in this section focuses on the following aspects: question inversion
and separated verb prefixes. For a more detailed discussion of restructuring for statis-
tical machine translation the reader is referred to Nie?en and Ney (2000, 2001).
3.1 Question Inversion
In many languages, the sentence structure of questions differs from the structure in
declarative sentences in that the order of the subject and the corresponding finite verb
is inverted. From the perspective of statistical translation, this behavior has some dis-
187
Nie?en and Ney SMT with Scarce Resources
advantages: The algorithm for training the parameters of the target language model
Pr(eI1), which is typically a standard n-gram model, cannot deduce the probability
of a word sequence in an interrogative sentence from the corresponding declarative
form. The same reasoning is valid for the lexical translation probabilities of multiword-
phrase pairs. To harmonize the word order of questions with the word order in declar-
ative sentences, the order of the subject (including the appendant articles, adjectives
etc.) and the corresponding finite verb is inverted. In English questions supporting
dos are removed. The application of the described preprocessing step in the bilingual
training corpus implies the necessity of restoring the correct forms of the translations
produced by the machine translation algorithm. This procedure was suggested by
Brown et al (1992) for the language pair English and French, but they did not re-
port on experimental results revealing the effect of the restructuring on the translation
quality.
3.2 Separated Verb Prefixes
German prefix verbs consist of a main part and a detachable prefix, which can be
shifted to the end of the clause. For the automatic alignment process, it is often dif-
ficult to associate one English word with more than one word in the corresponding
German sentence, namely, the main part of the verb and the separated prefix. To solve
the problem of separated prefixes, all separable word forms of verbs are extracted
from the training corpus. The resulting list contains entries of the form prefix|main.
In all clauses containing a word matching a main part and a word matching the cor-
responding prefix part occurring at the end of the clause, the prefix is prepended to
the beginning of the main part.
4. Hierarchical Lexicon Models
In general, the probabilistic lexicon resulting from training the translation model con-
tains all word forms occurring in the training corpus as separate entries, not taking
into account whether or not they are inflected forms of the same lemma. Bearing in
mind that typically more than 40% of the word forms are seen only once in training
(see, for example, Table 5), it is obvious that for many words, learning the correct
translations is difficult. Furthermore, new input sentences are expected to contain un-
known word forms, for which no translation can be retrieved from the lexicon. This
problem is especially relevant for more-inflecting languages like German: Texts in Ger-
man contain many more distinct word forms than their English translations. Table 5
also reveals that these words are often generated via inflection from a smaller set of
base forms.
4.1 A Hierarchy of Equivalence Classes of Inflected Word Forms
As mentioned in Section 2.3, the lemma-tag representation of the information from
morpho-syntactic analysis makes it possible to gradually access information with dif-
ferent grades of abstraction. Consider, for example, the German verb form ankomme,
which is the indicative present first-person singular form of the lemma ankommen and
can be translated into English by arrive. The lemma-tag representation provides an
?observation tuple? consisting of
? the original full word form (e.g., ankomme),
? morphological and syntactic tags (part of speech, tense, person, case, . . . )
(e.g., verb, indicative, present tense, 1st person singular), and
188
Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 2
? the base form (e.g., ankommen).
In the following, ti0 = t0, . . . , ti denotes the representation of a word where the base
form t0 and i additional tags are taken into account. For the example above, t0 =
ankommen, t1 = verb, and so on. The hierarchy of equivalence classes F0, . . . ,Fn is as
follows:
Fn = F(tn0) = ankommen verb indicative present singular 1
Fn?1 = F(tn?10 ) = ankommen verb indicative present singular
Fn?2 = F(tn?20 ) = ankommen verb indicative present
...
F0 = F(t0) = ankommen
where n is the maximum number of morpho-syntactic tags. The mapping from the
full lemma-tag representation back to inflected word forms is generally unambigu-
ous; thus Fn contains only one element, namely, ankomme. Fn?1 contains the forms
ankomme, ankommst, and ankommt; in Fn?2 the number (singular or plural) is ig-
nored, and so on. The largest equivalence class contains all inflected forms of the
base form ankommen.1 Section 4.2 introduces the concept of combining information at
different levels of abstraction.
4.2 Log-Linear Combination
In modeling for statistical machine translation, a hidden variable aJ1, denoting the
hidden alignment between the words in the source and target languages, is usually
introduced into the string translation probability:
Pr(f J1 |eI1) =
?
aJ1
Pr(f J1, a
J
1|eI1) =
?
aJ1
Pr(aJ1|eI1) ? Pr(f

J
1, e
I
1) (1)
In the following, Tj =
(
tn0
)
j denotes the lemma-tag representation of the jth word in
the input sentence. The sequence TJ1 stands for the sequence of readings for the word
sequence f J1 and can be introduced as a new hidden variable:
Pr(f J1 |a
J

1 The order of omitting tags can be defined in a natural way depending on the part of speech. In
principle this decision can also be left to the maximum-entropy training, when features for all possible
sets of tags are defined, but this would cause the number of parameters to explode. As the experiments
in this work have been carried out only with up to three levels of abstraction as defined in Section 4.2,
the set of tags of the intermediate level is fixed, and thus the priority of the tags needs not be specified.
The relation between this equivalence class hierarchy and the suggestions in Section 2.4 is clear:
Choosing candidates for morpho-syntactic tags not relevant for translation amounts to fixing a level in
the hierarchy. This is exactly what has been done to define the intermediate level in Section 4.2.
189
Nie?en and Ney SMT with Scarce Resources
Let T (fj) be the set of interpretations which are regarded valid readings of fj by the
morpho-syntactic analyzers on the basis of the whole-sentence context f J1. We assume
that the probability functions defined above yield zero for all other readings, that is,
when Tj ? T (fj). Under the usual independence assumption, which states that the
probability of the translation of words depends only on the identity of the words
associated with each other by the word alignment, we get
Pr(f J1 |a

I
1) =

Tj ? T (fj)
J

j=1
p(fj, Tj|eaj) (4)
As has been argued in Section 2.2, the number of readings |T (fj)| per word form can
be reduced to one for the tasks for which experimental results are reported here.
The elements in equation (4) are the joint probabilities p(f , T|e) of f and the read-
ings T of f given the target language word e. The maximum-entropy principle rec-
ommends choosing for p the distribution which preserves as much uncertainty as
possible in terms of maximizing the entropy, while requiring p to satisfy constraints
which represent facts known from the data. These constraints are encoded on the basis
of feature functions hm(x), and the expectation of each feature hm over the model p is
required to be equal to the observed expectation. The maximum-entropy model can
be shown to be unique and to have an exponential form involving a weighted sum
over the feature functions hm (Ratnaparkhi 1997). In equation (5), the notation tn0 is
used again for the lemma-tag representation of an input word (this was denoted by T
in equations (2)?(4) for notational simplicity):
p(f , T|e) = p?(f , tn0 |e) =
exp
[
?
m
?mhm(e, f , tn0)
]
?
f? ,?tn0
exp
[
?
m
?mhm(e, f? , t?n0)
] (5)
where ? = {?m} is the set of model parameters with one weight ?m for each feature
function hm. These model parameters can be trained using converging iterative training
procedures like the ones described by Darroch and Ratcliff (1972) or Della Pietra, Della
Pietra, and Lafferty (1995).
In the experiments presented in this article, the sum over the word forms f? and
the readings t?n0 in the denominator of equation (5) is restricted to the readings of word
forms having the same base form and partial reading as a word form f ?? aligned at
least once to e.
The new lexicon model p?(f , tn0 |e) can now replace the usual lexicon model p(f |e),
over which it has the following main advantages:
? The decomposition of the modeled events into feature functions allows
meaningful probabilities to be provided for word forms that have not
occurred during training as long as the feature functions involved are
well-defined. (See also the argument later in the article and the definition
of first-level and second-level feature functions presented in
Section 4.2.1.)
? Introducing the hidden variable T = tn0 and constraining the lexicon
probability to be zero for interpretations considered nonvalid readings of
190
Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 2
f (that is, for tn0 ? T (f )) amounts to making context information from the
complete sentence f J1 locally available: The sentence context was taken
into account by the morpho-syntactic analyzer, which chose the valid
readings T (f ).
4.2.1 Definition of Feature Functions. There are numerous possibilities for defining
feature functions. We do not need to require that they all have the same parametric
form or that the components be disjoint and statistically independent. Still, it is nec-
essary to restrict the number of parameters so that optimizing them is practical. We
used the following types of feature functions, which have been defined on the basis
of the lemma-tag representation (see Section 2.3):
First level: m = {L, e?}, where L is the base form:
h1L,?e(e, f , t
n
0) =
{
1 if e = e? and t0 = L and f ? F(tn0) (?)
0 otherwise
Second level: m = {T, L, e?}, with subsets T of cardinality ? n of morpho-syntactic
tags considered relevant (see Section 2.4 for a description of the detection
of relevant tags):
h2T,L,?e(e, f , t
n
0) =
{
1 if (?) and T ? tn1 (??)
0 otherwise
Third level: m = {F, T, L, e?}, with the fully inflected original word form F:
h3F,T,L,?e(e, f , t
n
0) =
{
1 if (??) and F = f
0 otherwise
In terms of the hierarchy introduced in Section 4.1, this means that information at three
different levels in the hierarchy is combined. The subsets T of relevant tags mentioned
previously fix the intermediate level.2 This choice of the types of features as well as
the choice of the subsets T is reasonable but somewhat arbitrary. Alternatively one
can think of defining a much more general set of features and applying some method
of feature selection, as has been done, for example, by Foster (2000), who compared
different methods for feature selection within the task of translation modeling for
statistical machine translation. Note that the log-linear model introduced here uses one
parameter per feature. For the Verbmobil task, for example, there are approximately
162, 000 parameters: 47,800 for the first-order features, 55,700 for the second-order
features, and 58,500 for the third-order features. No feature selection or threshold was
applied: All features seen in training were used.
4.2.2 Training Procedure. The overall process of training and testing with hierarchical
lexicon models is depicted in Figure 1. This figure includes the possibility of using
restructuring operations as suggested in Section 3 in order to deal with structural dif-
ferences between the languages involved. This can be especially advantageous in the
case of multiword phrases which jointly fulfill a syntactic function: Not merging them
2 Of course, there is not only one set of relevant tags, but at least one per part of speech. In order to
keep the notation as simple as possible, this fact is not accounted for in the formulas and the textual
descriptions.

would raise the question of how to distribute the syntactic tags which have been asso-
ciated with the whole phrase. In Section 5.2 we describe a method of learning multi-
word phrases using conventional dictionaries. The alignment on the training corpus
is trained using the original source language corpus containing inflected word forms.
This alignment is then used to count the co-occurrences of the annotated ?words? in
the lemma-tag representation of the source language corpus with the words in the tar-
get language corpus. These event counts are used for the maximum-entropy training
of the model parameters ?.
The probability mass is distributed over (all readings of) the source language
word forms to be supported for test (not necessarily restricted to those occurring dur-
ing training). The only precondition is that the firing features for these unseen events
are known. This ?vocabulary supported in test,? as it is called in Figure 1, can be a
predefined closed vocabulary, as is the case in Verbmobil, in which the output of a
speech recognizer with limited output vocabulary is to be translated. In the easiest
case it is identical to the vocabulary found in the source language part of the training
corpus. The other extreme would be an extended vocabulary containing all automati-
cally generated inflected forms of all base forms occurring in the training corpus. This
vocabulary is annotated with morpho-syntactic tags, ideally under consideration of all
possible readings of all word forms.

To enable the application of the hierarchical lexicon model, the source language
input sentences in test have to be analyzed and annotated with their lemma-tag rep-
resentation before the actual translation process. So far, the sum over the readings in
equation (4) has been ignored, because when the techniques for reducing the amount
of ambiguity described in Section 2.2 and the disambiguated conventional dictionaries
resulting from the approach presented in Section 5.1 are applied, there remains almost
always only one reading per word form.
5. Conventional Dictionaries
Conventional dictionaries are often used as additional evidence to better train the
model parameters in statistical machine translation. The expression conventional dictio-
nary here denotes bilingual collections of word or phrase pairs predominantly collected
?by hand,? usually by lexicographers, as opposed to the probabilistic lexica, which are
learned automatically. Apart from the theoretical problem of how to incorporate ex-
ternal dictionaries in a mathematically sound way into a statistical framework for
machine translation (Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Goldsmith 1993) there are
also some pragmatic difficulties: As discussed in Section 2.2, one of the disadvantages
of these conventional dictionaries as compared to full bilingual corpora is that their
entries typically contain single words or short phrases on each language side. Conse-
quently, it is not possible to distinguish among the translations for different readings
of a word. In normal bilingual corpora, the words can often be disambiguated by
taking into account the sentence context in which they occur. For example, from the
context in the sentence Ich werde die Zimmer buchen, it is possible to infer that Zimmer
in this sentence is plural and has to be translated by rooms in English, whereas the
correct translation of Zimmer in the sentence Ich ha?tte gerne ein Zimmer is the singular
form room. The dictionary used by our research group for augmenting the bilingual
data contains two entries for Zimmer: (?Zimmer?|?room?) and (?Zimmer?|?rooms?).
5.1 Disambiguation without Context
The approach described in this section is based on the observation that in many of the
cases of ambiguous entries in dictionaries, the second part of the entry?that is, the
other-language side?contains the information necessary to decide upon the interpre-
tation. In some other cases, the same kind of ambiguity is present in both languages,
and it would be possible and desirable to associate the (semantically) corresponding
readings with one another. The method proposed here takes advantage of these facts
in order to disambiguate dictionary entries.
Figure 2 sketches the procedure for the disambiguation of a conventional dictio-
nary D. In addition to D, a bilingual corpus C1 of the same language pair is required
to train the probability model for tag sequence translations. The word forms in C1
need not match those in D. C1 is not necessarily the training corpus for the translation
task in which the disambiguated version of D will be used. It does not even have to
be taken from the same domain.
A word alignment between the sentences in C1 is trained with some automatic
alignment algorithm. Then the words in the bilingual corpus are replaced by a reduced
form of their lemma-tag representation, in which only a subset of their morpho-syntactic
tags is retained?even the base form is dropped. The remaining subset of tags, in
the following denoted by Tf for the source language and Te for the target language,
consists of tags considered relevant for the task of aligning corresponding readings.
This is not necessarily the same set of tags considered relevant for the task of translation
which was used, for example, to fix the intermediate level for the log-linear lexicon

combination in Section 4.2.1. In the case of the Verbmobil corpus, the maximum length
of a tag sequence is five.
The alignment is used to count the frequency of a certain tag sequence tf in the
source language to be associated with another tag sequence te in the target language
and to compute the tag sequence translation probabilities p(tf |te) as relative frequen-
cies. For the time being, these tag sequence translation probabilities associate readings
of words in one language with readings of words in the other language: Multiword
sequences are not accounted for.
To alleviate this shortcoming it is possible and advisable to automatically detect
and merge multiword phrases. As will be described in Section 5.2, the conventional
bilingual dictionary itself can be used to learn and validate these phrases. The resulting
multiword phrases Pe for the target language and Pf for the source language are
afterwards concatenated within D to form entries consisting of pairs of ?units.?
The next step is to analyze the word forms in D and generate all possible readings
of all entries. It is also possible to ignore those readings that are considered unlikely
for the task under consideration by applying the domain-specific preference rules
proposed in Section 2.2. The process of generating all readings includes replacing word
forms with their lemma-tag representation, which is thereafter reduced by dropping
all morpho-syntactic tags not contained in the tag sets Tf and Te.
Using the tag sequence translation probabilities p(tf |te), the readings in one lan-
guage are aligned with readings in the other language. These alignments are applied to
the full lemma-tag representation (not only tags in Tf and Te) of the expanded dictio-
nary containing one entry per reading of the original word forms. The highest-ranking
aligned readings according to p(tf |te) for each lemma are preserved.
194
Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 2
The resulting disambiguated dictionary contains two entries for the German word
Zimmer: (?Zimmer-noun-sg.?|?room-noun-sg.?) and (?Zimmer-noun-pl.?|?room-noun-
pl.?). The target language part is then reduced to the surface forms: (?Zimmer-noun-sg.?|
?room?) and (?Zimmer-noun-pl.?|?rooms?). Note that this augmented dictionary, in the
following denoted by D?, has more entries than D as a result of the step of generating
all readings. The two entries (?beabsichtigt?|?intends?) and (?beabsichtigt?|?intended?),
for example, produce three new entries: (?beabsichtigt-verb-ind.-pres.-sg.-
3rd?|?intends?), (?beabsichtigt-verb-past-part.?|?intended?), and (?beabsichtigt-
adjective-pos.?|?intended?).
5.2 Multiword Phrases
Some recent publications deal with the automatic detection of multiword phrases (Och
and Weber 1998; Tillmann and Ney 2000). These methods are very useful, but they have
one drawback: They rely on sufficiently large training corpora, because they detect
the phrases from automatically learned word alignments. In this section a method for
detecting multiword phrases is suggested which merely requires monolingual syntactic
analyzers and a conventional dictionary.
Some multiword phrases which jointly fulfill a syntactic function are provided
by the analyzers. The phrase irgend etwas (?anything?), for example, may form either
an indefinite determiner or an indefinite pronoun. irgend=etwas is merged by the
analyzer in order to form one single vocabulary entry. In the German part of the Verb-
mobil training corpus 26 different, nonidiomatic multiword phrases are merged, while
there are 318 phrases suggested for the English part. In addition, syntactic informa-
tion like the identification of infinitive markers, determiners, modifying adjectives (for
example, single room), premodifying adverbials (more comfortable), and premodifying
nouns (account number) are used for detecting multiword phrases. When applied to
the English part of the Verbmobil training corpus, these hints suggest 7,225 different
phrases.
Altogether, 26 phrases for German and about 7,500 phrases for English are detected
in this way. It is quite natural that there are more multiword phrases found for English,
as German, unlike English, uses compounding. But the experiments show that it is not
advantageous to use all these phrases for English. Electronic dictionaries can be useful
for detecting those phrases which are important in a statistical machine translation
context: A multiword phrase is considered useful if it is translated into a single word
or a distinct multiword phrase (suggested in a similar way by syntactic analysis) in
another language. There are 290 phrases chosen in this way for the English language.
6. Overall Procedure for Training with Scarce Resources
Taking into account the interdependencies of inflected forms of the same base form
is especially relevant when inflected languages like German are involved and when
training data are sparse. In this situation many of the inflected word forms to account
for in test do not occur during training. Sparse bilingual training data also make ad-
ditional conventional dictionaries especially important. Enriching the dictionaries by
aligning corresponding readings is particularly useful when the dictionaries are used
in conjunction with a hierarchical lexicon, which can access the information neces-
sary to distinguish readings via morpho-syntactic tags. The restructuring operations
described in Section 3 also help in coping with the data sparseness problem, because
they make corresponding sentences more similar. This section proposes a procedure
for combining all these methods in order to improve the translation quality despite
sparseness of data. Figure 3 sketches the proposed procedure.

Two different bilingual corpora C1 and C2, one monolingual target language cor-
pus, and a conventional bilingual dictionary D can contribute in various ways to the
overall result. It is important to note here that C1 and C2 can, but need not, be dis-
tinct, and that the monolingual corpus can be identical to the target language part of
C2. Furthermore these corpora can be taken from different domains, and C1 can be
(very) small. Only C2 has to represent the domain and the vocabulary for which the
translation system is built, and only the size of C2 and the monolingual corpus have
a substantial effect on the translation quality. It is interesting to note, though, that
a basic statistical machine translation system with an accuracy near 50% can be built
without any domain-specific bilingual corpus C2, solely on the basis of a disambiguated
dictionary and the hierarchical lexicon models, as Table 9 shows.
? In the first step, multiword phrases are learned and validated on the
dictionary D in the way described in Section 5.2. These multiword
phrases are concatenated in D. Then an alignment is trained on the first
bilingual corpus C1. On the basis of this alignment, the tag sequence
translation probabilities which are needed to align corresponding
readings in the dictionary are extracted, as proposed in Section 5.1. The
result of this step is an expanded and disambiguated dictionary D?. For
this purpose, C1 does not have to cover the vocabulary of D. Besides C1
196
Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 2
can be comparatively small, given the limited number of tag sequence
pairs (tf |te) for which translation probabilities must be provided: In the
Verbmobil training corpus, for example, there are only 261 different
German and 110 different English tag sequences.
? In the next step, the second bilingual corpus C2 and D? are combined,
and a word alignment A for both is trained. C2, D?, and A are presented
as input to the maximum-entropy training of a hierarchical lexicon
model as described in Section 4.2.
? The language model can be trained on a separate monolingual corpus.
As monolingual data are much easier and cheaper to compile, this
corpus might be (substantially) larger than the target language part of C2.
7. Experimental Results
7.1 The Tasks and the Corpora
Tests were carried out on Verbmobil data and on Nespole! data. As usual, the sentences
from the test sets were not used for training. The training corpora were used for
training the parameters of IBM model 4.
7.1.1 Verbmobil. Verbmobil was a project for automatic translation of spontaneously
spoken dialogues. A detailed description of the statistical translation system within
Verbmobil is given by Ney et al (2000) and by Och (2002). Table 5 summarizes the
characteristics of the English and German parallel corpus used for training the param-
eters of IBM model 4. A conventional dictionary complements the training corpus (see
Table 6 for the statistics). The vocabulary in Verbmobil was considered closed: There
are official lists of word forms which can be produced by the speech recognizers. Such
lists exist for German and English (see Table 7). Table 8 lists the characteristics of the
two test sets Test and Develop taken from the end-to-end evaluation in Verbmobil, the
development part being meant to tune system parameters on a held-out corpus dif-
ferent from the training as well as the test corpus. As no parameters are optimized on
the development set for the methods described in this article, most of the experiments
were carried out on a joint set containing both test sets.

It aimed to provide multimodel support for negotiation (Nespole! 2000; Lavie et al
2001). Table 5 summarizes the corpus statistics of the Nespole! training set. Table 8
provides the corresponding figures for the test set used in this work.
7.2 The Translation System
For testing we used the alignment template translation system, described in Och,
Tillmann, and Ney (1999). Training the parameters for this system entails training of
IBM model 4 parameters in both translation directions and combining the resulting
alignments into one symmetrized alignment. From this symmetrized alignment, the
lexicon probabilities as well as the so-called alignment templates are extracted. The
latter are translation patterns which capture phrase-level translation pairs.
7.3 Performance Measures
The following evaluation criteria were used in the experiments:
BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): This score, proposed by Papineni et
al. (2001), is based on the notion of modified n-gram precision, with
n ? {1, . . . , 4}: All candidate unigram, bigram, trigram, and four-gram
counts are collected and clipped against their corresponding maximum
reference counts. The reference n-gram counts are calculated on a corpus
198
Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 2
of reference translations for each input sentence. The clipped candidate
counts are summed and normalized by the total number of candidate n-
grams. The geometric mean of the modified precision scores for a test
corpus is calculated and multiplied by an exponential brevity penalty fac-
tor to penalize too-short translations. BLEU is an accuracy measure, while
the others are error measures.
m-WER (multireference word error rate): For each test sentence there is a set of
reference translations. For each translation hypothesis, the edit distance
(number of substitutions, deletions, and insertions) to the most similar
reference is calculated.
SSER (subjective sentence error rate): Each translated sentence is judged by a
human examiner according to an error scale from 0.0 (semantically and
syntactically correct) to 1.0 (completely wrong).
ISER (information item semantic error rate): The test sentences are segmented
into information items; for each of these items, the translation candidates
are assigned either ?OK? or an error class. If the intended information
is conveyed, the translation of an information item is considered correct,
even if there are slight syntactic errors which do not seriously deteriorate
the intelligibility.
For evaluating the SSER and the ISER, we have used the evaluation tool EvalTrans
(Nie?en and Leusch 2000), which is designed to facilitate the work of manually judging
evaluation quality and to ensure consistency over time and across evaluators.
7.4 Impact of the Corpus Size
It is a costly and time-consuming task to compile large texts and have them translated
to form bilingual corpora suitable for training the model parameters for statistical
machine translation. As a consequence, it is important to investigate the amount of
data necessary to sufficiently cover the vocabulary expected in testing. Furthermore,
we want to examine to what extent the incorporation of morphological knowledge
sources can reduce this amount of necessary data. Figure 4 shows the relation between
the size of a typical German corpus and the corresponding number of different full
forms. At the size of 520,000 words, the size of the Verbmobil corpus used for training,
this curve still has a high growth rate.
To investigate the impact of the size of the bilingual corpus available for train-
ing, on translation quality three different setups for training the statistical lexicon on
Verbmobil data have been defined:
? using the full training corpus as described in Table 5, comprising 58,000
sentences
? restricting the corpus to 5,000 sentences (approximately every 11th
sentence)
? using no bilingual training corpus at all (only a bilingual dictionary; see
subsequent discussion)
The language model is always trained on the full English corpus. The argument for
this is that monolingual corpora are always easier and less expensive to obtain than
bilingual corpora. A conventional dictionary is used in all three setups to complement

the bilingual corpus. In the last setup, the lexicon probabilities are trained exclusively
on this dictionary
As Table 9 shows, the quality of translation drops significantly when the amount
of bilingual data available during training is reduced: When the training corpus is
restricted to 5,000 sentences, the SSER increases by about 7% and the ISER by about
3%. As could be expected, the translations produced by the system trained exclusively
on a conventional dictionary are very poor: The SSER jumps over 60%.
7.5 Results for Log-Linear Lexicon Combination
7.5.1 Results on the Verbmobil Task. As was pointed out in Section 4, the hierarchi-
cal lexicon is expected to be especially useful in cases in which many of the inflected
word forms to be accounted for in test do not occur during training. To systematically
investigate the model?s generalization capability, it has been applied on the three dif-
ferent setups described in Section 7.4. The training procedure was the one proposed
in Section 6, which includes restructuring transformations in training and test. Table 9
summarizes the improvement achieved for all three setups.
Training on 58,000 sentences plus conventional dictionary: Compared to the ef-
fect of restructuring, the additional improvement achieved with the hier-
archical lexicon is relatively small in this setup. The combination of all
methods results in a relative improvement in terms of SSER of almost
13% and in terms of information ISER of more than 16% as compared to
the baseline.
Training on 5,000 sentences plus conventional dictionary: Restructuring alone
can improve the translation quality from 37.3% to 33.6%. The benefit from
the hierarchical lexicon is larger in this setup, and the resulting in SSER is
31.8%. This is a relative improvement of almost 15%. The relative improve-
ment in terms of ISER is almost 22%. Note that by applying the methods
200

?Restructuring? entails treatment of question inversion and separated verb prefixes as
well as merging of phrases in both languages. A conventional dictionary is available in
all three setups. The language model is always trained on the full monolingual English
corpus. Task: Verbmobil. Testing on 527 sentences (Test and Develop).

proposed here, the corpus for training can be reduced to less than 10%
of the original size while increasing the SSER only from 30.2% to 31.8%
compared to the baseline when using the full corpus.
Training only on conventional dictionary: In this setup the impact of the hierar-
chical lexicon is clearly larger than the effect of the restructuring methods,
because here the data sparseness problem is much more important than
the word order problem. The overall relative reduction in terms of SSER
is 13.7% and in terms of ISER 19.1%. An error rate of about 52% is still
very poor, but it is close to what might be acceptable when only the gist
of the translated document is needed, as is the case in the framework of
document classification or multilingual information retrieval.
Examples taken from the Verbmobil Eval-2000 test set are given in Table 10.
Smoothing the lexicon probabilities over the inflected forms of the same lemma en-
ables the translation of sind as would instead of are. The smoothed lexicon contains the
translation convenient for any inflected form of bequem. The comparative more conve-
nient would be the completely correct translation. The last two examples in the table
demonstrate the effect of the disambiguating analyzer, which on the basis of the sen-
tence context identifies Zimmer as plural (it has been translated into the singular form
room by the baseline system) and das as an article to be translated by the instead of a
pronoun which would be translated as that. The last example demonstrates that over-
fitting on domain-specific training can be problematic in some cases: Generally, because
is a good translation for the co-ordinating conjunction denn, but in the appointment-
scheduling domain, denn is often an adverb, and it often occurs in the same sentence
as dann, as in Wie wa?re es denn dann?. The translation for this sentence is something
like How about then?. Because of the frequency of this domain-specific language use,
the word form denn is often aligned to then in the training corpus. The hierarchical

7.5.2 Results on the Nespole! Task. We were provided with a small German-English
corpus from the Nespole! project (see Section 7.1 for a description). From Table 5 it
is obvious that this task is an example of very scarce training data, and it is thus
interesting to test the performance of the methods proposed in this article on this
task. The same conventional dictionary as was used for the experiments on Verbmobil
data (cf. Table 6) complemented the small bilingual training corpus. Furthermore, the
(monolingual) English part of the Verbmobil corpus was used in addition to the English
part of the Nespole! corpus for training the language model. Table 11 summarizes the
results. Information items have not been defined for this test set. An overall relative
improvement of 16.5% in the SSER can be achieved.
8. Conclusion
In this article we have proposed methods of incorporating morphological and syntactic
information into systems for statistical machine translation. The overall goal was to
improve translation quality and to reduce the amount of parallel text necessary to

inversion and separated verb prefixes as well as
merging of phrases in both languages. The same
conventional dictionary was used as in the
experiments the Verbmobil. The language model
was trained on a combination of the English parts

train the model parameters. Substantial improvements on the Verbmobil task and the
Nespole! task were achieved.
Some sentence-level restructuring transformations have been introduced which
are motivated by knowledge about the sentence structure in the languages involved.
These transformations aim at the assimilation of word orders in related sentences.
A hierarchy of equivalence classes has been defined on the basis of morpholog-
ical and syntactic information beyond the surface forms. The study of the effect of
using information from either degree of abstraction led to the construction of hier-
archical lexicon models, which combine different items of information in a log-linear
way. The benefit from these combined models is twofold: First, the lexical coverage is
improved, because the translation of unseen word forms can be derived by consider-
ing information from lower levels in the hierarchy. Second, category ambiguity can be
resolved, because syntactical context information is made locally accessible by means
of annotation with morpho-syntactic tags. As a side effect of the preparative work for
setting up the underlying hierarchy of morpho-syntactic information, those pieces of
information inherent in fully inflected word forms that are not relevant for translation
are detected.
A method for aligning corresponding readings in conventional dictionaries con-
taining pairs of fully inflected word forms has been proposed. The approach uses
information deduced from one language side to resolve category ambiguity in the
corresponding entry in the other language. The resulting disambiguated dictionar-
ies have proven to be better suited for improving the quality of machine translation,
especially if they are used in combination with the hierarchical lexicon models.
The amount of bilingual training data required to achieve an acceptable quality of
machine translation has been systematically investigated. All the methods mentioned
previously contribute to a better exploitation of the available bilingual data and thus
to improving translation quality in frameworks with scarce resources. Three setups for
training the parameters of the statistical lexicon on Verbmobil data have been exam-
ined: (1) Using the full 58,000 sentences comprising the bilingual training corpus, (2)
restricting the corpus to 5,000 sentences, and (3) using only a conventional dictionary.
For each of these setups, a relative improvement in terms of subjective sentence error
rate between 13% and 15% as compared to the baseline could be obtained using combi-
nations of the methods described in this article. The amount of bilingual training data
could be reduced to less than 10% of the original corpus, while losing only 1.6% in
accuracy as measured by the subjective sentence error rate. A relative improvement of
16.5% in terms of subjective sentence error rate could also be achieved on the Nespole!
task.
