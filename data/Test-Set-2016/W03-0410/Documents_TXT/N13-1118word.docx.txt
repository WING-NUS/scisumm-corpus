Abstract

We  present  a  novel approach  to automatic 
metaphor  identification, that discovers  both 
metaphorical  associations  and metaphorical 
expressions  in unrestricted  text.   Our sys- 
tem first performs hierarchical graph factor- 
ization clustering (HGFC) of nouns and then 
searches the resulting  graph for metaphorical 
connections between concepts. It then makes 
use of the salient features of the metaphori- 
cally connected clusters to identify the actual 
metaphorical expressions.  In contrast to pre- 
vious work, our method is fully unsupervised. 
Despite this fact, it operates with an encour- 
aging precision (0.69) and recall (0.61). Our 
approach is also the first one in NLP to exploit 
the cognitive findings on the differences in or- 
ganisation of abstract and concrete concepts in 
the human brain.


1   Introduction

Metaphor has traditionally been viewed as a form  of 
linguistic creativity, that gives our expression more 
vividness, distinction  and artistism. While this is 
true on the surface,  the mechanisms of metaphor 
have a much  deeper origin in our reasoning.   To- 
day metaphor is widely understood   as a cognitive 
phenomenon operating at the level of mental pro- 
cesses, whereby  one concept or domain is system- 
atically viewed in terms of the properties of another 
(Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). Consider the examples 
(1) “He shot down all of my arguments” and (2) “He 
attacked every weak point in my argument”.  They 
demonstrate a metaphorical  mapping of the concept 
of argument to that of war. The argument, which is 
the target concept, is viewed in terms of a battle (or


a war), the source concept. The existence of such a 
link allows us to systematically describe arguments 
using the war terminology,  thus leading to a num- 
ber of metaphorical expressions. Lakoff and John- 
son call such generalisations a source–target domain 
mapping, or conceptual metaphor.
  The ubiquity of metaphor in language  has been 
established in a number of corpus studies (Cameron,
2003; Martin, 2006; Steen et al., 2010; Shutova 
and Teufel, 2010) and the role it plays in human 
reasoning has been confirmed  in psychological ex- 
periments (Thibodeau and Boroditsky,  2011). This 
makes metaphor an important research area for com- 
putational and cognitive linguistics, and its auto- 
matic processing indispensable for any semantics- 
oriented NLP application. The problem of metaphor 
modeling is gaining interest  within NLP,  with a 
growing number of approaches exploiting statisti- 
cal techniques (Mason, 2004; Gedigian et al., 2006; 
Shutova, 2010; Shutova et al., 2010; Turney et al.,
2011; Shutova et al., 2012).  Compared  to more 
traditional approaches based on hand-coded knowl- 
edge (Fass, 1991;  Martin, 1990; Narayanan, 1997; 
Narayanan, 1999; Feldman and Narayanan, 2004; 
Barnden and Lee, 2002; Agerri et al., 2007), these 
more recent methods tend to have  a wider cover- 
age,  as well as be more efficient,  accurate and ro- 
bust. However,  even the statistical metaphor pro- 
cessing approaches so far often focused on a lim- 
ited domain or a subset  of phenomena (Gedigian 
et al., 2006; Krishnakumaran  and Zhu, 2007), and 
only addressed one of the metaphor processing sub- 
tasks: identification of metaphorical mappings (Ma- 
son, 2004) or identification of metaphorical expres- 
sions (Shutova et al., 2010; Turney et al., 2011). In 
this paper, we present the first computational method

that identifies the generalisations  that govern the 
production of metaphorical  expressions, i.e.  con- 
ceptual metaphors, and then uses these generalisa- 
tions to identify metaphorical expressions in unre- 
stricted text. As opposed to previous works on sta- 
tistical metaphor processing that were supervised or 
semi-supervised, and thus required training data, our 
method is fully unsupervised. It relies on building  a 
hierarchical graph of concepts connected by their as- 
sociation strength (using hierarchical clustering) and 
then searching for metaphorical links in this graph.
  Shutova et al. (2010) introduced the hypothesis 
of “clustering by association”  and claimed  that in 
the course of distributional  noun clustering, abstract 
concepts tend to cluster together if they are associ- 
ated with the same source domain,  while concrete 
concepts cluster by meaning similarity.  We share 
this intuition, but take this idea a significant   step 
further. Our approach is theoretically grounded in 
the cognitive  science findings suggesting that ab- 
stract and concrete  concepts  are organised  differ- 
ently in the human brain (Crutch  and Warrington,
2005; Binder et al., 2005; Wiemer-Hastings  and 
Xu, 2005; Huang et al., 2010; Crutch and Warring- 
ton, 2010; Adorni and Proverbio,  2012). Accord- 
ing to Crutch and Warrington  (2005), these differ- 
ences emerge from their general patterns of relation 
with other concepts.  However,  most NLP systems 
to date treat abstract and concrete concepts as iden- 
tical.  In contrast,  we incorporate this distinction 
into our model by creating a network  (or a graph) 
of concepts, and automatically  learning the differ- 
ent patterns of association of abstract and concrete 
concepts with other concepts. We expect that, while 
concrete concepts would tend to naturally organise 
into a tree-like  structure (with more specific terms 
descending from the more general terms), abstract 
concepts would exhibit a more complex  pattern of 
associations. Consider the example in Figure 1. The 
figure schematically   shows a small portion of the 
graph describing the concepts of mechanism (con- 
crete), political system and relationship  (abstract) 
at two levels of generality. One can see from this 
graph that if concrete concepts, such as bike or en- 
gine tend to be connected to only one concept at the 
higher level in the hierarchy (mechanism), abstract 
concepts may have multiple  higher-level  associates: 
the literal ones and the metaphorical  ones.  For ex-


ample, the abstract concept of democracy is liter- 
ally associated with a more general concept of po- 
litical system,  as well as metaphorically  associated 
with the concept of mechanism.  Such multiple  as- 
sociations  are due to the fact that political systems 
are metaphorically  viewed as mechanisms, they can 
function, break, they can be oiled etc. We often dis- 
cuss them using mechanism terminology,  and thus a 
corpus-based distributional learning approach would 
learn that they share features with political systems 
(from  their literal  uses), as well as with mechanisms 
(from their metaphorical  uses, as shown next to the 
respective graph edges in the figure). Our system 
discovers such association patterns within the graph 
and uses them to identify metaphorical connections 
between the concepts.
  To the best of our knowledge, our method is the 
first one to use a hierarchical  clustering  model  for 
the metaphor processing task. The original graph of 
concepts is built using hierarchical graph factoriza- 
tion clustering (HGFC) (Yu et al., 2006) of nouns, 
yielding a network  of clusters with different levels 
of generality.  The weights  on the edges of the graph 
indicate association between the clusters (concepts). 
HGFC has not been previously  employed for noun 
clustering in NLP, but showed successful results in 
the verb clustering task (Sun and Korhonen, 2011).
  In summary, our system (1) builds a graph of con- 
cepts using HGFC, (2) traverses it to find metaphor- 
ical associations between clusters using weights on 
the edges of the graph, (3) generates lists of salient 
features for the metaphorically  connected clusters 
and (4) searches the British National Corpus (BNC) 
(Burnard, 2007) for metaphorical  expressions de- 
scribing the target domain concepts using the verbs 
from the set of salient features. We evaluated the 
performance of the system with the aid of human 
judges in precision- and recall-oriented  settings. In 
addition, we compared its performance to that of two 
baselines, an unsupervised baseline using agglom- 
erative clustering (AGG) and a supervised baseline 
built upon WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) (WN).

2   Method

2.1   Dataset and Feature Extraction

Our noun dataset used for clustering contains 2000 
most frequent nouns in the BNC (Burnard, 2007).


 


Figure 1: Organisation of the hierarchical graph of concepts




Following  previous semantic noun classification ex- 
periments (Pantel and Lin, 2002; Bergsma et al.,
2008), we use  the grammatical  relations (GRs) 
as features  for clustering. We extracted the fea- 
tures from  the Gigaword  corpus (Graff  et al.,
2003), which was  first parsed  using the RASP 
parser (Briscoe  et al., 2006).  The verb lemmas 
in  VERB–SUBJECT,   VERB–DIRECT OBJECT   and 
VERB–INDIRECT OBJECT  relations with the nouns 
in the dataset were then extracted from the GR out- 
put of the parser. The feature values were the relative 
frequencies of the features.


2.2   Hierarchical Graph Factorization
Clustering

The most widely used method for hierarchical word 
clustering  is AGG  (Schulte  im Walde and Brew,
2001; Stevenson  and Joanis,  2003; Ferrer, 2004; 
Devereux and Costello,  2005). The method treats 
each word as a singleton  cluster  and then succes- 
sively merges two closest clusters until all the clus- 
ters have been merged into one. The cluster simi- 
larity is measured using linkage criteria (e.g. Ward 
(1963) measures the decrease  in variance for the 
clusters being merged).  As opposed to this, HGFC 
derives probabilistic  bipartite graphs from the sim- 
ilarity matrix (Yu et al., 2006). Since we require  a 
graph of concepts, our task is rather different from 
standard hierarchical word clustering that produces 
a tree of concepts.  In a tree,  each word can only


erarchical clustering tasks (Yu et al., 2006; Sun and 
Korhonen, 2011), but its hierarchical graph output 
is also a more suitable representation of the concept 
graph. In addition, HGFC can detect the number of 
levels and the number of clusters on each level of 
the hierarchical graph automatically.  This is essen- 
tial for our task as these settings are difficult to pre- 
define for a general-purpose concept graph.
  Given  a set of nouns, V = {vn}N    , the similar- 
ity matrix	for HGFC is constructed using Jensen-
Shannon Divergence.  W can be encoded by an undi- 
rected graph G (Figure 2(a)), where the nouns are 
mapped to vertices and Wij  is the edge weight be- 
tween vertices i and j.  The graph G and the clus- 
ter structure can be represented by a bipartite graph
K (V, U ).  V are the vertices on G. U = {up  m
represent the hidden m clusters. For example, look-
ing at Figure 2(b), V on G can be grouped into three 
clusters u1, u2 and u3.  The matrix B denotes the
n × m adjacency matrix, with bip being the connec-
tion weight between the vertex vi and the cluster up.
Thus, B represents the connections between clus- 
ters at an upper and lower level of clustering. A 
flat clustering algorithm  can be induced by assign- 
ing a lower level node to the parent node that has the 
largest connection weight. The number of clusters 
at any level can be determined by only counting the 
number of non-empty nodes (namely the nodes that 
have at least one lower level node associated).
The bipartite graph K also induces  a similarity


have a unique parent cluster at each level. Our con-


(W t) between vi  and vj :  wt


m 	bip bjp


ij  = 2:p=1


λp 	=


cept graph does not have this constraint:  at any level
a word can be associated with an arbitrary number 
of parent clusters. Therefore, not only HGFC out- 
performed agglomerative clustering methods in hi-


(BΛ−1BT )ij  where Λ = diag(λ1, ..., λm).  There- 
fore, B can be found by minimizing  the divergence 
distance (ζ ) between the similarity matrices W and 
W t:

The matrices B
and Λ are initialized randomly. 
We found that the


  Yu et al. (2006) showed that this cost function is 
non-increasing under the update rule:

wij


actual initialization  values have little impact on 
the
final result. The rows in B are normalized after 
the initialization so the values in each row add up to 
one. For a word vi, the probability of assigning it to 
clus-


h˜ip  ∝ hip

The cost function can thus be optimized by updating
h and λ alternately.
  The similarity between clusters p(up, uq ) can be 
induced from B, as follows:


p(up , uq )   =  p(up )p(up |uq ) = (BT D−1 B)pq 	(4)
m
D 	=  diag(d1 , ..., dn ) where di  =     bip 
p=0

We can then construct  a new graph G1  (Figure
2(d)) with the clusters U as vertices,  and the clus- 
ter similarity p as the connection  weight. The clus- 
tering algorithm can now be applied again (Figure
2(e)). This process can go on iteratively, leading to 
a hierarchical  graph.
  The number  of levels (L)  and the number  of 
clusters (ml ) are detected automatically,  using the 
method of Sun and Korhonen  (2011). Clustering 
starts with an initial setting of number of clusters 
(m0) for the first level. In our experiment,  we set the


=   (D(−1)	−1 	−1
1 	B1 D2    B2 ...Dl    Bl )ip 	(5)


Due to the random walk property of the graph, 
ml is non-increasing for higher levels (Sun and 
Korho- nen, 2011). The algorithm can thus 
terminate when all nouns are assigned to one 
cluster.  We run 1000 iterations of updates of h 
and λ (equation 2 and 3) for each two adjacent 
levels.
  The resulting graph is composed of a set of 
bipar- tite graphs defined by Bl , Bl−1, ..., B1.  A 
bipartite graph  has a similar structure  as in 
Figure 1. For a given noun, we can rank the 
clusters at any level ac- cording to the soft 
assignment probability  (eq. 5). The clusters that 
have no member noun were hidden from the 
ranking since they do not explicitly repre- sent 
any concept.  However,  these clusters are still part 
of the organisation of conceptual  space within the 
model and they contribute to the probability for 
the clusters on upper levels (eq. 5). We call the 
view of the hierarchical  graph where these empty 
clusters


are hidden an explicit graph. The whole algorithm 
can be summarized  as follows:


SOURCE: fire
TARGET 1: sense hatred emotion  passion enthusiasm


 		sentiment hope interest feeling resentment optimism

Compute the similarity matrix W0 from V

l ← l + 1 ; ml  ← No. non-empty clusters (eq. 5)
end while
return Bl , Bl−1 ...B1


2.3   Identification of Metaphorical  Associations

Once we obtained the explicit graph of concepts, we 
can now identify  metaphorical associations based on 
the weights connecting the clusters at different levels 
(eq. 5). Taking a single noun (e.g. fire) as input, the 
system computes the probability  of its cluster mem- 
bership for each cluster  at each level, using these 
weights. We expect the cluster membership prob- 
abilities to indicate the level of association of the 
input noun with the clusters.  The system can then 
rank the clusters at each level based on these prob- 
abilities. We chose level 3 as the optimal level of 
generality for our experiments,  based on our qualita- 
tive analysis of the graph. The system selects 6 top- 
ranked clusters from this level (we expect an average 
source concept to have no more than 5 typical tar- 
get associates) and excludes the literal cluster con- 
taining the input concept (e.g. “fire flame blaze”). 
The remaining clusters represent the target concepts 
associated with the input source concept. Example 
output for the input concepts of fire and disease is 
shown in Figure 3.  One  can see from the Figure 
that each of the noun-to-cluster mappings represents 
a new conceptual metaphor, e.g. EMOTION is FIRE, 
VIOLENCE is FIRE, CRIME is a DISEASE etc. These 
mappings are exemplified  in language by a number 
of metaphorical  expressions (e.g. “His anger will 
burn him”, “violence flared again”, “it’s time they 
found a cure for corruption”).

2.4   Identification of Salient Features and
Metaphorical Expressions

After extracting the source–target domain mappings, 
we now move on to the identification of the cor-


SOURCE: disease
TARGET 1:  fraud outbreak offense connection  leak 
count crime violation  abuse conspiracy corruption  ter- 
rorism suicide
TARGET 2: opponent critic rival
TARGET 3: execution destruction signing
TARGET 4: refusal absence fact failure lack delay

Figure 4: Salient features for fire and the violence cluster

responding metaphorical  expressions.  The system 
does this by harvesting the salient features that lead 
to the input noun being strongly associated with the 
extracted clusters.  The salient features are selected 
by ranking the features according to the joint prob- 
ability of the feature (f ) occurring both with the in- 
put noun (w) and the cluster (c). Under a simplified
independence assumption, p(w, c|f )  = p(w|f ) ×
p(c|f ). p(w|f ) and p(c|f ) are calculated  as the ra-
tio of the frequency of the feature f to the total
frequency of the input noun and the cluster respec- 
tively.  The features ranked higher  are expected to 
represent the source domain vocabulary that can be 
used to metaphorically  describe the target concepts. 
We selected the top 50 features from the ranked list. 
Example features (verbs and their grammatical rela- 
tions) extracted for the source domain noun fire and 
the violence cluster are shown in Figure 4.
  We then refined the lists of features by means of 
selectional preference (SP) filtering. We use SPs to


FEELING IS FIRE
hope lit (Subj), anger blazed (Subj), optimism raged 
(Subj), enthusiasm engulfed them (Subj), hatred flared 
(Subj), passion flared (Subj), interest lit (Subj), fuel re- 
sentment (Dobj),  anger crackled (Subj), feelings roared 
(Subj), hostility blazed (Subj), light with hope (Iobj)

CRIME IS A DISEASE
cure crime (Dobj), abuse transmitted  (Subj), eradicate 
terrorism (Dobj), suffer from corruption (Iobj), diag- 
nose  abuse  (Dobj), combat fraud (Dobj), cope with 
crime (Iobj), cure abuse (Dobj),  eradicate  corruption

Figure 5:  Identified metaphorical  expressions for the 
mappings FEELING IS FIRE and CRIME IS A DISEASE

quantify how well the extracted features describe the 
source domain (e.g. fire).  We extracted nominal ar- 
gument distributions of the verbs in our feature lists 
for VERB–SUBJECT,  VERB–DIRECT OBJECT   and 
VERB–INDIRECT OBJECT relations.  We used the al- 
gorithm of Sun and Korhonen (2009) to create SP 
classes and the measure of Resnik (1993) to quantify 
how well a particular  argument  class fits the verb. 
Resnik measures  selectional  preference  strength 
SR(v) of a predicate  as a Kullback-Leibler  distance 
between two distributions:  the prior probability of 
the noun class P (c) and the posterior probability
of the noun class given the verb P (c|v).  SR(v) =
P (c|v)


3   Evaluation and Discussion

3.1   Baselines

AGG:    the agglomerative  clustering baseline is 
constructed using SciPy implementation (Oliphant,
2007) of Ward’s linkage method (Ward, 1963). The 
output tree is cut according to the number of lev- 
els and the number of clusters of the explicit graph 
detected by HGFC. The resulting tree is converted 
into a graph by adding connections from each clus- 
ter to all the clusters one level above. The connec- 
tion weight (the cluster distance) is measured us- 
ing Jensen-Shannon Divergence between the cluster 
centroids.  This graph is used in place of the HGFC 
graph in the metaphor identification  experiments.
WN: in the WN baseline, the WordNet hierarchy is 
used as the underlying  graph of concepts, to which 
the metaphor extraction method is applied. Given 
a source concept,  the system extracts all its sense-
1 hypernyms two levels above and subsequently all 
of their sister terms. The hypernyms themselves are 
considered to represent the literal sense of the source 
noun and are, therefore, removed.  The sister terms 
are kept as potential  target domains.

3.2   Evaluation of Metaphorical  Associations

To create  our dataset,  we extracted  10 common


D(P (c|v)||P (c)) = 2:c P (c|v) log


P (c)  . In order


source concepts that map to 
multiple targets from


to quantify how well a particular  argument class fits
the verb, Resnik  defines selectional  association  as
AR(v, c)  =     1     P (c|v) log P (c|v) .  We rank the


the Master Metaphor List (Lakoff et al., 1991) and
linguistic analyses of metaphor (Lakoff and John- 
son, 1980; Shutova  and Teufel, 2010).	These

P (c)


nominal arguments of the verbs in our feature lists
using their selectional association with the verb, and 
then only retain the features whose top 5 arguments 
contain the source concept.  For example, the verb 
start, that is a common  feature for both fire and the 
violence cluster (e.g. “start a war”, “start a fire”), 
would be filtered out in this way, whereas the verbs 
flare or blaze would be retained as descriptive source 
domain vocabulary.
  We then search the RASP-parsed BNC for gram- 
matical relations, in which the nouns from the target 
domain cluster appear with the verbs from the source 
domain vocabulary (e.g. “war blazed” (subj), “to 
fuel violence” (dobj) for the mapping VIOLENCE is 
FIRE). The system thus annotates metaphorical ex- 
pressions in text, as well as the corresponding  con- 
ceptual metaphors, as shown in Figure 5.


included FIRE,  CHILD,  SPEED, WAR,  DISEASE,
BREAKDOWN,  CONSTRUCTION, VEHICLE,  SYS- 
TEM, BUSINESS. Each of the three systems identi- 
fied 50 source–target domain mappings for the given 
source domains, resulting in a set of 150 conceptual 
metaphors (each representing a number of submap- 
pings since all the target  concepts  are clusters  or 
synsets). These were then evaluated against human 
judgements in two different experimental settings. 
Setting 1:  The judges were presented with a set 
of conceptual metaphors identified by the three sys- 
tems, randomized.  They were asked to annotate the 
mappings they considered valid. In all our experi- 
ments, the judges were encouraged to rely on their 
own intuition of metaphor, but they also reviewed 
the metaphor annotation guidelines of Shutova and 
Teufel (2010). Two independent judges, both na-


tive speakers of English, participated in this exper- 
iment. Their agreement on the task was κ = 0.60 
(n  = 2, N  = 150, k  = 2) (Siegel and Castel- 
lan, 1988). The main differences in the annotators’ 
judgements stem from the fact that some metaphor- 
ical associations are less obvious and common than 
others, and thus need more context (or imaginative 
effort) to establish. Such examples, where the judges 
disagreed included  metaphorical  mappings such as 
INTENSITY  is SPEED, GOAL is a CHILD, COLLEC- 
TION is a SYSTEM, ILLNESS is a BREAKDOWN.
  The system performance   was  then evaluated 
against these judgements in terms of precision (P ), 
i.e. the proportion of the valid metaphorical map- 
pings among those identified. We calculated sys- 
tem precision (in all experiments) as an average over 
both annotations. HGFC operates with a precision  of 
P = 0.69, whereas the baselines attain P = 0.36 
(AGG) and P  = 0.29 (WN).  The precision of an- 
notator judgements against each other (the human 
ceiling) is P = 0.80, suggesting that this is a chal- 
lenging task.
Setting 2: To measure recall, R, of the systems we 
asked two annotators (both native  speakers with a 
background in metaphor, different  from Setting 1) 
to write down up to 5 target concepts they strongly 
associated  with each  of the 10 source  concepts. 
Their annotations were then aggregated into a sin- 
gle metaphor association gold standard, consisting 
of 63 mappings in total. The recall of the systems 
was measured against this gold standard, resulting in 
HGFC R = 0.61, AGG R = 0.11 and WN R = 0.03.
  As expected,  HGFC outperforms both AGG  and 
WN baselines in both settings. AGG has been pre- 
viously shown to be less accurate than HGFC in the 
verb clustering task (Sun and Korhonen, 2011). Our 
analysis of the noun clusters indicated  that HGFC 
tends to produce more pure and complete clusters 
than AGG.  Another important  reason AGG fails is 
that it by definition  organises all concepts into tree 
and optimises its solution locally, taking into ac- 
count  a small number of clusters at a time. How- 
ever,  being able to discover  connections between 
more distant domains and optimising globally over 
all concepts is crucial for metaphor identification. 
This makes AGG less suitable for the task, as demon- 
strated by our results. However, AGG identified  a 
number of interesting  mappings missed by HGFC,


e.g. CAREER IS A  CHILD, LANGUAGE  IS A  SYS- 
TEM, CORRUPTION IS A  VEHICLE, EMPIRE IS A 
CONSTRUCTION, as well as a number  of mappings 
in common with HGFC, e.g. DEBATE IS A WAR, DE- 
STRUCTION IS A  DISEASE.  The WN  system also 
identified  a few interesting metaphorical mappings 
(e.g. COGNITION IS FIRE, EDUCATION IS CON- 
STRUCTION), but its output is largely dominated by 
the concepts similar to the source noun and contains 
some unrelated concepts. The comparison of HGFC 
to WN shows that HGFC identifies meaningful prop- 
erties and relations of abstract concepts that can not 
be captured in a tree-like  classification  (even an ac- 
curate, manually created one). The latter is more ap- 
propriate for concrete concepts, and a more flexible 
representation is needed to model abstract concepts. 
The fact that both baselines identified  some valid 
metaphorical  associations, relying on less suitable 
conceptual graphs, suggests that our way of travers- 
ing the graph is a viable approach in principle.
   HGFC identifies valid metaphorical  associations 
for a range of source concepts. On of them (CRIME 
IS A  VIRUS) happened to have been already  vali- 
dated in psychological experiments (Thibodeau and 
Boroditsky, 2011). The most frequent type of error 
of HGFC is the presence of target clusters similar or 
closely related to the source noun (e.g. the parent 
cluster for child). The clusters from the same do- 
main can, however, be filtered out if their nouns fre- 
quently occur in the same documents with the source 
noun (in a large corpus),  i.e. by topical similarity. 
The latter is less likely for the metaphorically  con- 
nected nouns. We intend to implement this improve- 
ment in the future version of the system.

3.3   Evaluation of Metaphorical Expressions

For each of the identified conceptual metaphors, the 
three systems extracted  a number  of metaphorical 
expressions  from the corpus  (average of 430 for 
HGFC, 148 for AGG, and 855 for WN).   The ex- 
pressions were also evaluated against human judge- 
ments. The judges were presented with a set of ran- 
domly sampled  sentences containing metaphorical 
expressions  as annotated  by the system and by the 
baselines (200 each), randomized. They were asked 
to mark the tagged expressions that were metaphor- 
ical in their judgement  as correct.  Their agreement 
on the task was κ = 0.56 (n = 2, N = 600, k = 2),


HLJ 26 [..] ”effective action”  was needed to eradicate 
terrorism, drug-trafficking and corruption.
EG0 275 In the 1930s the words ”means test” was  a 
curse, fuelling the resistance against it both among the 
unemployed and some of its administrators.
CRX 1054 [..]    if  the rehabilitative  approach were 
demonstrably successful in curing crime.
HL3 1206 [..] he would strive to accelerate progress 
towards the economic integration of the Caribbean. 
HXJ 121 [..] it is likely that some industries will flour- 
ish in certain countries as the market  widens.

Figure 6: Metaphors tagged by the system (in bold)


whereby the main source of disagreement was the 
presence of lexicalized  metaphors, e.g. verbs such 
as impose,  decline  etc.  The system performance 
against these annotations is P = 0.65 (HGFC), P =
0.47 (AGG) and P = 0.12 (WN). The human ceiling 
for this task was measured at P = 0.79. Figure 6 
shows example sentences annotated by HGFC. The 
performance of our unsupervised approach is close 
to the previous supervised systems of Mason (2004) 
(accuracy of 0.73) and Shutova et al. (2010) (preci- 
sion of 0.79), however, the results are not directly 
comparable due to different experimental settings.

  The system errors in this task stem from multiple 
word  senses of the salient features or the source and 
target sharing some physical properties (e.g. one can 
“die from crime” and “die from a disease”).  Some 
identified  expressions invoke  a chain of mappings 
(e.g. ABUSE IS A DISEASE, DISEASE IS AN ENEMY 
for “combat abuse”), however,  such chains are not 
yet incorporated into the system. The performance 
of AGG is higher than in the mappings identification 
task, since it outputs only few expressions for the 
incorrect mappings. In contrast, WN tagged a large 
number of literal expressions  due to the incorrect 
prior identification of the underlying associations.

  Since there is no large metaphor-annotated corpus 
available, it was impossible for us to reliably evalu- 
ate the recall of metaphorical expressions. However, 
we estimated it as a recall of salient features.  We 
manually  compiled  sets of typical features for the
10 source domains, and measured their recall among 
the top 50 HGFC features at R = 0.70. However, in 
practice the coverage in this task would directly de- 
pend on that of the metaphorical associations.


4   Related Work

One of the first attempts to identify and interpret 
metaphorical  expressions in text is the met* sys- 
tem of Fass (1991), that utilizes  hand-coded knowl- 
edge and detects non-literalness via selectional pref- 
erence  violation.  In case  of a  violation, the re- 
spective phrase is first tested for being metonymic 
using hand-coded patterns (e.g. CONTAINER-FOR- 
CONTENT).  If this fails, the system  searches the 
knowledge  base for a relevant  analogy  in order to 
discriminate metaphorical relations from anomalous 
ones.  The system  of Krishnakumaran  and Zhu 
(2007) uses WordNet  (the hyponymy  relation)  and 
word bigram counts to predict verbal, nominal and 
adjectival metaphors at the sentence level. The au- 
thors discriminate between conventional metaphors 
(included in WordNet) and novel metaphors. Birke 
and Sarkar (2006) present a sentence clustering  ap- 
proach that employs   a set  of seed  sentences  an- 
notated for literalness and computes similarity be- 
tween the new input sentence and all of the seed sen- 
tences. The system then tags the sentence as literal 
or metaphorical according to the annotation in the 
most similar seeds, attaining  an f-score of 53.8%.
  The first system to discover source–target domain 
mappings automatically is CorMet (Mason, 2004). 
It does this by searching for systematic variations 
in domain-specific verb selectional preferences. For 
example, pour is a characteristic  verb in both LAB 
and FINANCE domains. In the LAB  domain it has 
a strong preference for liquids and in the FINANCE 
domain for money. From this the system infers the 
domain mapping FINANCE – LAB  and the concept 
mapping  money – liquid.   Gedigian et al. (2006) 
trained a maximum  entropy  classifier  to discrimi- 
nate between  literal and metaphorical  use.   They 
annotated the sentences from PropBank (Kingsbury 
and Palmer, 2002) containing the verbs of MOTION 
and CURE for metaphoricity.  They used PropBank 
annotation (arguments and their semantic types) as 
features  for classification and report an accuracy 
of 95.12% (however, against a majority  baseline of
92.90%).  The metaphor identification   system of 
Shutova et al. (2010) starts from a small seed set 
of metaphorical expressions, learns the analogies in- 
volved in their production and extends the set of 
analogies by means of verb and noun clustering. As


a result, the system can recognize new metaphorical 
expressions in unrestricted text (e.g. from the seed 
“stir  excitement” it infers that “swallow anger” is 
also a metaphor), achieving  a precision of 79%.
  Turney et al. (2011) classify verbs and adjectives 
as literal or metaphorical based on their level of con- 
creteness or abstractness in relation to a noun they 
appear with. They learn concreteness rankings for 
words automatically (starting from a set of exam- 
ples) and then search for expressions where a con- 
crete adjective or verb is used with an abstract noun 
(e.g. “dark humour” is tagged  as a metaphor  and 
“dark hair” is not). They report an accuracy of 73%.

5   Conclusions and Future  Directions

Previous  research on metaphor  addressed a num- 
ber of different  aspects of the phenomenon, and has 
shown that these aspects can be successfully mod- 
eled using statistical techniques. However, the meth- 
ods often focused on a limited domain and needed 
manually-labeled  training data. This made them dif- 
ficult to apply in a real-world  setting with the goal of 
improving  semantic interpretation in NLP at large. 
Our method takes a step towards this direction.  It is 
fully unsupervised, and thus more robust, and can 
perform accurate metaphor identification  in unre- 
stricted text. It identifies metaphor with a precision 
of 69% and a recall of 61%, which is a very encour- 
aging result for an unsupervised method. We be- 
lieve that this work has important implications  for 
computational and cognitive modeling of metaphor, 
but is also applicable to a range  of other seman- 
tic tasks within NLP. Integrating different represen- 
tations of abstract and concrete concepts into NLP 
systems may improve their performance, as well as 
make the models more cognitively  plausible.
  One of our key future research objectives is to in- 
vestigate the use and adaptation of the created con- 
ceptual graph to perform metaphor interpretation. In 
addition, we plan to extend this work to cover nom- 
inal and adjectival metaphors, by harvesting salient 
nominal and adjectival features.
