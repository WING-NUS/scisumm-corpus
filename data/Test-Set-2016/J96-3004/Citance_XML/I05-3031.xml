			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">The Chinese word segmentation is a nontrivial task because no explicit delimiters (like spaces in English) are used for word separation.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">As the task is an important precursor to many natural language processing systems, it receives a lot of attentions in the literature for the past decade (Wu and Tseng, 1993; Sproat et al., 1996).</S>

			<S sid ="15" ssid = "1">2.1 Chinese Word Segmentation as Tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "2">One of the difficulties in Chinese word segmentation is that, Chinese characters can appear in different positions within a word (Xue and Shen, 2003), and LMR Tagging was proposed to solve the problem.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "3">The basic idea of LMR Tagging is to assign to each character, based on its contextual information, a tag which represents its relative position within the word.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "4">Note that the original tag set used by (Xue and Shen, 2003) is simplified and improved by (Ng and Low, 2004) . We shall then adopt and illustrate the simplified case here.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "5">The tags and their meanings are summarized in Table 1.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "6">Tag L, M, and R correspond to the character at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the word respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "7">Tag S means the character is a “single-character” word.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "8">Figure 1 illustrates a Chinese sentence segmented by spaces, and the corresponding tagging results.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "9">After transforming the Chinese segmentation problem to the tagging problem, various solutions can be applied.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "10">Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt) (Berger, S. A. Della Pietra, and Original sentence: Օᓡ໛ᦟپՓڍഅරΖ After segmentation: Օᓡ ໛ᦟ پ Փڍഅර Ζ Tagging: ҨҮ ҨҮ ү ҨҩҩҮ ү assigned: y∗ = arg max y∈{L,M,R,S} p(y|x).</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "11">Figure 1: Example of LMR Tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "12">V. J. Della Pietra, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1996) was proposed in the original work to solve the LMR Tagging problem.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "13">In order to make MaxEnt success in LMR Tagging, feature templates used in capturing useful contextual information must be carefully designed.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "14">Furthermore, it is unavoidable that invalid tag sequences will occur if we just assign the tag with the highest probability.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "15">In the next subsection, we describe the feature templates and measures used to correct the tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "16">Table 1: Tags used in LMR Tagging scheme.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "17">The features describing the characteristics of Chinese segmentation problem are instantiations of the feature templates listed in Table 2.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "18">Note that feature templates only describe the forms of features, but not the actual features.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "19">So the number of features used is much larger than the number of templates.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "20">Table 2: Feature templates used in R-phase.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "21">Example used is “32 @�*”.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "22">Tag Description L Character is at the beginning of the word (or the character is the leftmost character in the word) M Character is in the middle of the word RCharacter is at the end of the word (or the charac ter is the rightmost character in the word) S Character is a ”single-character” word 2.2 Two-Phase LMRRC Tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "23">In this section, we introduce our Two-Phase LMRRC Tagging used to perform Chinese Text Segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "24">The first phase, R-phase, is called Regular Tagging, in which similar procedures as in the original LMR Tagging are performed.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "25">The difference in this phase as compared to the original one is that, we use extra feature templates to capture characteristics of Chinese word segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "26">The second phase, C-phase, is called Correctional Tagging, in which the sentences are re- tagged by incorporating the regular tagging results.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "27">We hope that tagging errors can be corrected under this way.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "28">The models used in both phases are trained using MaxEnt model.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "29">Regular Tagging Phase In this phase, each character is tagged similar to the original approach.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "30">In our scheme, given the contextual information (x) of current charac ter, the tag (y∗) with highest probability will be Additional feature templates as compared to (Xue and Shen, 2003) and (Ng and Low, 2004) are template 5 and 6.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "31">Template 5 is used to handle documents with ASCII characters.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "32">For template 6, as it is quite common that word boundary occurs in between two characters with different types, this template is used to capture such characteristics.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "33">Correctional Tagging Phase In this phase, the sequence of characters is re- tagged by using the additional information of tagging results after R-phase.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "34">The tagging procedure is similar to the previous phase, except extra features (listed in Table 3) are used to assist the tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "35">Table 3: Additional feature templates used in C- phase.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "36">Example used is “32 @�*” with tagging results after R-phase as “SSLMR”.</S>

			<S sid ="52" ssid = "38">Separated Mode means the models used in two phases are separated.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "39">Model for R-phase is called R-model, and model for C-phase is called C-model.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "40">Integrated Mode means only one model, I-model is used in both phases.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "41">The training methods are illustrated now.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "42">First of all, training data are divided into three parts, (1) Regular Training, (2) Correctional Training, and (3) Evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "43">Our method first trains using observations extracted from Part 1 (observation is simply the pair (context, tag) of each character).</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "44">The created model is used to process Part 2.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "45">After that, observations extracted from Part 2 (which include previous tagging results) are used to create the final model.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "46">The performance is then evaluated by processing Part 3.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "47">Let O be the set of observations, with subscripts R or C indicating the sources of them.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "48">Let T rainM odel : O → P , where P is the set of models, be the “model generating” function.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "49">The two proposed training methods can be illustrated as follow: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "50">Separated Mode.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "51">R − model = T rainM odel(OR), C − model = T rainM odel(OC ).</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "52">2.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "53">Integrated Mode.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "54">I − model = T rainM odel(OR ∪ OC ).</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "55">The advantage of Separated Mode is that, it is easy to aggregate different sets of training data.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "56">It also provides a mean to handle large training data under limited resources, as we can divide the training data into several parts, and then use the similar idea to train each part.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "57">The drawback of this mode is that, it may lose the features’ characteristics captured from Part 1 of training data, and Integrated Mode is proposed to address the problem, in which all the features’ characteristics in both Part 1 and Part 2 are used to train the model.</S>

	<SECTION title="Experimental Results and Discussion. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "1">We conducted closed track experiments on the Hong Kong City University (CityU) corpus in The Second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff to evaluate the proposed training and tagging methods.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "2">The training data were split into three portions.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "3">Part 1: 60% of the data is trained for R-phase; Part 2: 30% for C-phase training; and Part 3: the remaining 10% for evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "4">The evaluation part was further divided into six parts to simulate actual size of test document.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "5">The MaxEnt classifier was implemented using Java opennlp maximum entropy package from (Baldridge, Morton, and Bierner, 2004), and training was done with feature cutoff of 2 and 160 iterations.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "6">The experiments were run on an Intel Pentium4 3.0GHz machine with 3.0GB memory.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "7">To evaluate our proposed scheme, we carried out four experiments for each evaluation data.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "8">For Experiment 1, data were processed with R-phase only.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "9">For Experiment 2, data were processed with both Rand C-phase, using Separated Mode as training method.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "10">For Experiment 3, data were processed similar to Experiment 2, except Integrated Mode was used.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "11">Finally for Experiment 4, data were processed similar to Experiment 1, with both Part 1 and Part 2 data were used for R- model training.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "12">The purpose of Experiment 4 is to determine whether the proposed scheme can perform better than just the single Regular Tagging under the same amount of training data.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "13">Table 4 summarizes the experimental results measured in F-measure (the harmonic mean of precision and recall).</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "14">From the results, we obtain the following observations.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "15">1.</S>

			<S sid ="88" ssid = "17">Table 4: Experimental results of CityU corpus measured in F-measure.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "18">in Two-Phase Tagging (Exp 2 and Exp 3) outperform single Regular Tagging (Exp 1).</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "19">It is reasonable as more data are used in training.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "20">2.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "21">Integrated Mode (Exp 3) still performs better.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "22">than Exp 4, in which same amount of training data are used.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "23">This reflects that extra tagging information after R-phase helps in the scheme.</S>

			<S sid ="96" ssid = "25">Separated Mode (Exp 2) performs worse than.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "26">both Exp 3 and Exp 4.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "27">The reason is that the C- model cannot capture enough features’ characteristics used for basic tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "28">We believe that by adjusting the proportion of Part 1 and Part 2 of training data, performance can be increased.</S>
