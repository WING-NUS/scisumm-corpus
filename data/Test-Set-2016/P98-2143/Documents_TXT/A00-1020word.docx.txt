Abstract

In this paper we present a new, multi­ 
lingual data-driven method for coreference 
resolution as implemented in the SWIZZLE 
system. The results obtained after training 
this system on a bilingual corpus of English 
and Romanian tagged texts, outperformed 
coreference resolution in each of the indi­ 
vidual languages.


1    Introduction

The recent availability of large bilingual corpora has 
spawned interest in several areas of multilingual text 
processing.  Most of the research has focused on 
bilingual terminology identification, either as par­ 
allel multiwords forms (e.g.  the  Champollion sys­ 
tem (Smadja et al.1996)), technical terminology (e.g. 
the Termight system (Dagan and Church, 1994) or 
broad-coverage translation lexicons (e.g. the SABLE 
system (Resnik and Melamed, 1997)).  In addition, 
the Multilingual Entity Task (MET) from the TIP­ 
STER program1 (http://www-nlpir.nist.govjrelated­ 
projectsjtipsterjmet.htm)   challenged the partici­ 
pants  in the  Message Understanding  Conference 
(MUC) to extract named entities across several for­ 
eign language corpora, such as Chinese, Japanese 
and Spanish.
  In this paper we present a new application of 
aligned multilingual texts.   Since coreference reso­ 
lution is a pervasive discourse phenomenon causing 
performance impediments in current IE systems, we 
considered a corpus of aligned English and  Roma­ 
nian texts  to identify coreferring expressions.  Our 
task  focused on  the  same  kind  of coreference as 
considered in the past MUC competitions,  namely

the  identity coreference. Identity  coreference links 
nouns, pronouns and noun phrases (including proper 
names) to their corresponding antecedents.
  We created our bilingual collection by translating 
the  MUC-6 and  MUC-7 coreference training  texts 
into  Romanian  using native speakers.   The  train­ 
ing data  set for Romanian coreference used, wher­ 
ever possible, the same coreference identifiers as the 
English data and incorporated additional tags as 
needed.   Our  claim is that  by adding  the  wealth 
of coreferential features provided by multilingual 
data, new powerful heuristics for coreference resolu­ 
tion can be developed that  outperform monolingual 
coreference resolution systems.
  For both  languages,  we resolved coreference by 
using SWIZZLE, our implementation of a bilingual 
coreference resolver.  SWIZZLE is a multilingual en­ 
hancement of COCKTAIL (Harabagiu and Maiorano,
1999), a coreference resolution system that operates 
on a  mixture  of heuristics that  combine semantic 
and textual cohesive information2 •   When COCKTAIL 
was applied separately  on the English and the Ro­ 
manian  texts,  coreferring links were identified for 
each English and Romanian document respectively. 
When aligned referential expressions corefer with 
non-aligned anaphors, SWIZZLE derived new heuris­ 
tics for coreference.  Our experiments show that 
SWIZZLE  outperformed  COCKTAIL  on both  English 
and Romanian test documents.
  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec­ 
tion 2 presents COCKTAIL, a monolingual coreference 
resolution system used separately on both  the En­
glish and  Romanian  texts.    Section 3  details  the 
data-driven approach used in SWIZZLE and presents 
some of its resources. Section 4 reports and discusses
the experimental results.  Section 5 summarizes the

    2 The  name  of COCKTAIL  is a  pun  on  CogNIAC be­ 
cause COCKTAIL combines a larger number of heuristics 
than those reported  in (Baldwin, 1997). SWIZZLE, more­ 
over, adds new heuristics, discovered from the bilingual 
aligned corpus.





conclusions.

2    COCKTAIL

Currently,     some    of   the    best-performing   and 
most robust coreference resolution systems employ 
knowledge-based techniques.    Traditionally, these 
techniques have combined extensive syntactic, se­ 
mantic,  and  discourse  knowledge.   The  acquisition 
of such knowledge is time-consuming, difficult,  and 
error-prone. Nevertheless, recent results show that 
knowledge-poor methods perform with amazing ac­ 
curacy (cf. (Mitkov, 1998), (Kennedy and Boguraev,
1996)  (Kameyama, 1997)).   For example,  CogNIAC
(Baldwin, 1997), a system based on seven ordered 
heuristics,  generates high-precision  resolution  (over
90%) for some cases of pronominal  reference.   For 
this  research,  we used a coreference  resolution  sys­ 
tem  ((Harabagiu and  Maiorano,  1999))  that  imple­ 
ments different sets of heuristics  corresponding to 
various forms of coreference.   This system,  called 
COCKTAIL, resolves coreference by exploiting  several 
textual cohesion constraints (e.g.  term  repetition) 
combined  with  lexical  and  textual coherence  cues 
(e.g.    subjects of  communication  verbs  are  more 
likely to  refer to  the  last  person  mentioned  in  the 
text). These constraints are implemented  as a set of 
heuristics ordered by their priority.  Moreover, the 
COCKTAIL framework  uniformly addresses  the  prob­ 
lem of interaction between different forms of coref­ 
erence, thus making the extension to multilingual 
coreference very natural.

2.1     Data-Driven Coreference Resolution
In general,  we define a data-driven methodology  as 
a sequence  of actions  that   captures the  data  pat­ 
terns  capable  of resolving  a  problem  with  both  a 
high degree of precision and recall.  Our data-driven 
methodology  reported here generated sets  of heuris­ 
tics for the coreference resolution problem.  Precision 
is the  number  of correct  references out  of the  total 
number of coreferences resolved, whereas the recall 
measures  the  number  of resolved  references out  of 
the  total  number  of keys, i.e., the  annotated  coref­ 
erence data.
The data-driven methodology used in COCKTAIL is
centered  around  the  notion  of a  coreference  chain. 
Due to the  transitivity of coreference relations,  k 
coreference relations having at least one common ar­
gument  generate k + 1 core/erring  expressions. The
text position induces an order among coreferring ex­
pressions.   A  coreference  structure is created  when 
a set of coreferring expressions are connected  in an 
oriented  graph  such that  each node  is related  only 
to  one of its  preceding  nodes.   In  turn,   a  corefer-


ence  chain  is the coreference structure in which 
ev­ ery node is connected  to its immediately  
preceding node. Clearly, multiple coreference 
structures for the same set  of coreferring  
expressions  can  be mapped to a single coreference 
chain.  As an example,  both coreference structures 
illustrated in Figure 1(a)  and (c) are cast into the 
coreference chain illustrated in Figure 1(b).

Figure 1: Three  coreference 
structures.

  Given a corpus  annotated with coreference 
data, the data-driven methodology first generates 
all coreference  chains  in  the  data   set  and  then  
con­ siders all possible combinations of coreference 
re­ lations  that   would  generate   the  same  
coreference chains.    For  a  coreference  chain  of 
length  l  with nodes  n1,  n2, ... nl+1 , each  node 
nk   (1 k l) can be connected  to  any  of the  l - 
k  nodes  preceding it.   From  this  observation,   we 
find that  a  number
of 1 x 2 x ... x (l - k)... x l  = l! coreference 
struc­
tures can generate the same coreference chain.  
This
result is very important, since it allows for the 
auto­
matic generation of coreference data. For each 
coref­
erence relation  n from an annotated corpus we 
cre­
ated  a median  of (l- 1)! new coreference 
relations,
where l is the length of the coreference chain 
contain­
ing relation  n. This observation  gave us the  
possi­
bility  of expanding the  test  data  provided  by  
the
coreference keys available in the MUC-6 and  
MUC-
7 competitions (MUC-6 1996), (MUC-7 1998).  
The MUC-6 coreference annotated corpus contains  
1626 coreference relations,  while the  MUC-7 
corpus  has
2245 relations.  The  average length  of a 
coreference chain is 7.21 for the  MUC-6 data, and 
8.57 for the MUC-7 data. We were able to 
expand  the  number of annotated coreference  
relations  to  6,095,142 for the MUC-6 corpus and 
to 8,269,403 relations for the MUC-7 corpus;  this  
represents  an expansion  factor of 3,710. We are 
not aware of any other  automated way of creating  
coreference annotated data,  and  we believe that  
much of the COCKTAIL's impressive per­ formance 
is due to the plethora  of data  provided by this 
method.

Table 1: Best performing  heuristics  implemented in COCKTAIL




2.2     Knowledge-Poor Coreference
Resolution

The  result  of our  data-driven methodology  is the 
set  of  heuristics  implemented   in  COCKTAIL  which 
cover both nominal and pronoun coreference. Each 
heuristic   represents   a  pattern of  coreference  that 
was mined from the large set of coreference data. 
COCKTAIL uses knowledge-poor methods because (a) 
it  is based  only  on  a limited  number  of heuristics 
and (b) text processing is limited to part-of-speech 
tagging, named-entity recognition,  and approximate 
phrasal  parsing.  The heuristics  from COCKTAIL can 
be classified along two directions.   First  of all, they 
can  be  grouped  according  to  the  type  of corefer­ 
ence they resolve, e.g., heuristics that  resolve the 
anaphors of reflexive pronouns  operate differently 
than those resolving bare nominals.  Currently, in 
COCKTAIL there are heuristics  that  resolve five types 
of pronouns  (personal,  possessive, reflexive, demon­ 
strative and  relative)  and  three  forms  of nominals 
(definite,  bare and indefinite).
  Secondly, for each  type  of coreference,  there  are 
three  classes of heuristics  categorized  according  to 
their  suitability to  resolve coreference.    The  first 
class is comprised of strong indicators of coreference. 
This class resulted from the analysis of the distribu­ 
tion of the antecedents in the MUC annotated data. 
For example,  repetitions of named  entities  and  ap­ 
positives account for the majority of the nominal 
coreferences,  and,  therefore,   represent  anchors  for 
the first class of heuristics.
The  second  class  of coreference  covers cases  in


which the  arguments are  recognized  to  be seman­ 
tically consistent. COCKTAIL's test  of semantic  con­ 
sistency  blends together information available from 
WordNet  and statistics gathered from Treebank. 
Different consistency  checks are modeled for each of 
the heuristics.

Table  2:  Examples  of coreference  resolution.    The 
same annotated index indicates  coreference.

  The  third  class of heuristics  resolves coreference 
by coercing nominals.  Sometimes coercions involve 
only  derivational   morphology  -  linking  verbs  with 
their nominalizations. On other occasions, coercions 
are obtained as paths  of meronyms  (e.g.  is-part  re­ 
lations)  and  hypernyms  (e.g.  is-a  relations).   Con-





sistency checks implemented  for this class of coref­ 
erence are conservative:  either the adjuncts must be 
identical  or the adjunct  of the referent  must  be less 
specific than  the  antecedent.  Table 1 lists  the  top 
performing  heuristics  of COCKTAIL  for  pronominal 
and nominal coreference. Examples of the heuristics 
operation on the MUC data  are presented  presented 
in  Table  2.   Details  of the  top  performing  heuris­ 
tics of COCKTAIL  were reported  in  (Harabagiu and 
Maiorano, 1999).

2.3     Bootstrapping for  Coreference
Resolution

One  of  the  major   drawbacks  of  existing   corefer­ 
ence resolution  systems  is their  inability  to  recog­ 
nize many  forms of coreference displayed  by many 
real-world texts.  Recall measures of current  systems 
range  between  36% and  59% for  both  knowledge­ 
based and statistical techniques.  Knowledge based­ 
systems would perform better  if more coreference 
constraints were available whereas statistical meth­ 
ods would be improved if more annotated data  were 
available.   Since knowledge-based techniques out­ 
perform  inductive  methods,  we used high-precision 
coreference  heuristics   as  knowledge seeds  for  ma­ 
chine learning  techniques that  operate on large 
amounts   of  unlabeled   data.     One  such  technique 
is  bootstrapping,   which  was  recently  presented   in 
(Riloff and  Jones  1999),  (Jones  et  al.1999)  as  an 
ideal framework for text learning tasks that have 
knowledge seeds. The method does not require large 
training sets.  We extended COCKTAIL by using meta­ 
bootstrapping of both new heuristics and clusters of 
nouns that  display semantic  consistency for corefer­ 
ence.
  The coreference heuristics are the seeds of our 
bootstrapping framework for coreference resolution. 
When   applied   to  large  collections  of  texts,   the 
heuristics  determine   classes  of  coreferring  expres­ 
sions.   By generating coreference chains  out  of all 
these  coreferring  expressions,  often  new  heuristics 
are uncovered.  For example, Figure 2 illustrates the 
application of three heuristics  and the generation of 
data  for a new heuristic  rule. In COCKTAIL, after a 
heuristic  is applied,  a new coreference chain  is cal­ 
culated.   For the example  illustrated in Figure  2, if 
the reference of expression A is sought,  heuristic  Hl


the  FOIL-Gain  measure, as introduced by the 
FOIL
inductive   algorithm   (Cameron-Jones and  
Quinlan
1993).  Let H0   be the new heuristic  and H1 a 
heuris­ tic that  is already in the seed set.  Let Po be 
the num­ ber  of positive  coreference  examples  of  
Hnew (i.e. the number of coreference relations  
produced  by the heuristic  that  can be found in the 
test data)  and n0 the  number  of negative  examples 
of Hnew (i.e.  the number of relations generated by 
the heuristic which cannot  be found in the test 
data). Similarly, P1  and n1   are  the  positive  and  
negative  examples  of H1 • The new heuristics are 
scored by their  FOJL_Gain distance to the existing 
set of heuristics,  and the best scoring one is added  
to the  COCKTAIL system.  The FOILGain formula 
is:
FOILGain(H1,Ho) = k(log2    Pl         log2     Po      
)
P1 + n1	Po+ no
  where k is the  number  of positive examples 
cov­ ered by both  H1 and  Ho. Heuristic  Ho is 
added  to the seed set  if there  is no other  heuristic  
providing larger  FOILGain to any of the seed 
heuristics.


 
Figure 2: Bootstrapping new 
heuristics.

  Since in COCKTAIL, semantic consistency of core­ 
ferring expressions is checked by comparing the 
sim­ ilarity  of  noun  classes,  each  new  heuristic   
deter­ mines the adjustment of the similarity  
threshold  of all  known  coreferring  noun  classes.    
The  steps  of the  bootstrapping algorithm  that  
learns  both  new heuristics and adjusts the 
similarity  threshold of coreferential  expressions is:

MUTUAL  BOOTSTRAPPING  
LOOP
1. Score all candidate heuristics with FOIL-
Gain
2. BesLh=closest  candidate to 
heuristics(COCKTAIL)
3. Add BesLh to 
heuristics(COCKTAIL)
4. Adjust semantic similarity threshold for 
semantic consistency of core/erring nouns
5. Goto step 1 if the precision and recall did 
not degrade under minimal  performance.


indicates expression B to be the antecedent.  When	 	


the  coreference  chain  is  built,  expression  A is di­ 
rectly linked to expression D, thus uncovering a new 
heuristic  HO.
  As a rule of thumb,  we do not consider a new 
heuristic  unless there is massive evidence of its cov­ 
erage in the data.   To measure  the coverage we use
  

(Riloff and  Jones 1999) note  that  the  
bootstrap­ ping algorithm  works well but  its  
performance  can deteriorate rapidly  when non-
coreferring  data  enter as candidate heuristics.  To 
make the algorithm  more robust,  a second level of 
bootstrapping can be intro­ duced.  The outer  
bootstrapping mechanism,  called





meta-bootstrapping  compiles the results of the inner 
(mutual) bootstrapping  process and identifies the k 
most reliable heuristics, where k is a number de­ 
termined experimentally. These k heuristics are re­ 
tained and the rest of them are discarded.

3.1   Multilingual Coreference Data
To study the performance of a data-driven multi­ 
lingual coreference resolution system, we prepared a 
corpus of Romanian texts by translating the MUC-6 
and MUC-7 coreference training texts.  The transla­ 
tions were performed by a group of four Romanian 
native speakers, and were checked for style by a cer­ 
tified translator from Romania. In addition, the Ro­ 
manian texts were annotated  with coreference keys. 
Two rules were followed when the annotations  were 
done:
o1: Whenever an expression ER  represents a trans­ 
lation of an expression EE   from the corresponding 
English text,  if EE  is tagged as a coreference key 
with identification number ID, then the Romanian 
expression ER is also tagged with the same ID num­ 
ber.  This rule allows for translations  in which the 
textual  position of the referent and the antecedent
have been swapped.
o2:   Since the translations often introduce new 
coreferring expressions in the same chain, the  new 
expressions  are  given  new,  unused  ID  numbers. 
For example,  Table 3 lists  corresponding  English 
and Romanian fragments of coreference chains from 
the original MUC-6 Wall Street  Journal  document 
DOCNO: 930729-0143.
  Table 3 also shows the original MUC coreference 
SGML annotations.  Whenever present, the REF tag 
indicates the ID of the antecedent, whereas the MIN 
tag indicates the minimal reference expression.

3.2     Lexical Resources
The multilingual coreference resolution method im­ 
plemented in SWIZZLE incorporates the heuristics de­ 
rived from COKCTAIL's monolingual coreference res­ 
olution processing in both languages.  To this end, 
COCKTAIL required both sets of texts  to be tagged 
for part-of-speech and to recognize the noun phrases. 
The English texts  were parsed with Brill's part-of­ 
speech tagger (Brill1992) and the noun phrases were 
identified by the grammar rules implemented in the 
phrasal parser of FASTUS (Appelt et al., 1993). Cor­ 
responding resources are not available in Romanian.
  To minimize COCKTAIL's configuration for process­ 
ing Romanian  texts,  we implemented a Romanian 
part-of-speech rule-based tagger that  used the same

Table 3: Example of parallel English and Romanian 
text annotated for coreference. The elements from a 
coreference chain in the respective texts are under­ 
lined. The English text has only two elements in the 
coreference chain, whereas the Romanian text  con­ 
tains four different elements. The two additional ele­ 
ments of the Romanian coreference chain are derived 
due to (1) the need to translate  the relative clause 
from the English fragment into a separate sentence in 
Romanian; and (2) the reordering of words in the 
second sentence.

tags  as generated  by the  Brill tagger.   In  addition, 
we implemented  rules that  identify  noun  phrases in 
Romanian.
  To take advantage  of the aligned corpus, SWIZZLE 
also relied on bilingual lexical resources that  help 
translate the  referential  expressions.     For this 
purpose,  we used a core Romanian  WordNet 
(Harabagiu, 1999)  which encoded,  wherever  possi­ 
ble, links between the English synsets  and their  Ro­ 
manian  counterparts.   This  resource  also incorpo­ 
rated  knowledge derived from several bilingual dic­ 
tionaries  (e.g.  (Banta§, 1969)).
  Having  the  parallel  coreference  annotations, we 
can  easily  identify  their  translations because  they 
have the same identification  coreference key. Look­ 
ing  at  the  example  given  in  Table  3,  the  expres­ 
sion  "legii",  with  ID=500 is the  translation of the


implemented,  several other  principles  were 
applied. In our experiment, we were satisfied  
with the qual­ ity of the  translations 
recognized  by following only these two 
principles.

3.3     Multilingual Coreference 
Resolution
The SWIZZLE system  was run on a corpus of 
2335 referential  expressions  in  English  (927 
from  MUC-
6 and  1408 from  MUC-7)  and  2851 
Romanian  ex­
pressions  (1219 from MUC-6 and 1632 from 
MUC-
7). Initially, the heuristics implemented  in 
COCKTAIL were applied  separately to  the  two 
textual   collec­ tions.  Several special  cases 
arose.

Translation


ence resolution  performed  in SWIZZLE, however, re­
quires the translations of the English and Romanian 
antecedents. The principles guiding the translations 
of the  English  and  Romanian  antecedents (AE-R 
and  AR-E, respectively)  are:
• Circularity:  Given an  English  antecedent, due  to 
semantic  ambiguity, it can belong to several English 
WordNet sysnsets.  For each such sysnset Sf  we con­
sider the Romanian  corresponding sysnet(s)  Sf. We
filter out  all Sf that  do not contain  AE-R. If only
one  Romanian  sysnset  is left,  then  we identified  a
translation.   Otherwise,   we start from  the  Roma­ 
nian antecedent, find all synsets  Sf! to which it  be­ 
longs, and obtain  the corresponding English sysnets 
Sf. Similarly,  all  English  synsets  not  containing
the  English antecedent  are filtered  out.  If only one 
synset  remains,  we have again  identified  a transla­ 
tion.    Finally,  in  the  last  case,  the  intersection  of 
the  multiple  synsets  in either  language  generates  a 
legal translation.  For example,  the  English  synset
sE ={bill, measure}  translates into  the  Romanian
synset  sR  ={lege}.  First,   none  of the  dictionary
translations of bill into Romanian  (e.g.  politif., hac­
nota,  afi§) translate back into  any  of the  elements 
of sE. However the translation of measure into  the
Romanian  lege translates back into bill, its synonym.
• Semantic  density: Given an English  and a Roma­ 
nian antecedent, to establish whether they are trans­ 
lations of one another,  we disambiguate them by first 
collapsing  all sysnsets  that  have common elements. 
Then  we apply  the  circularity  principle,  relying on 
the  semantic  alignment  encoded  in the  Romanian 
WordNet.  When this core lexical database was first


Figure 3: Case 1 of multilingual  
coreference
  Case 1, which is the  ideal case, is shown in 
Fig­ ure  3.   It  occurs  when  two  referential  
expressions have  antecedents that   are  
translations of one  an­ other.  This situation 
occurred in 63.3% of the refer­ ential  
expressions  from MUC-6 and  in 58.7% of the 
MUC-7 references.  Over 50% of these are 
pronouns or named  entities.   However, all the  
non-ideal cases are more interesting for 
SWIZZLE, since they  port knowledge that  
enhances  system  performance.

coreference

  Case 2 occurs when the antecedents are not 
trans­ lations,  but  belong  to  or  corefer  with  
elements  of some  coreference  chains  that   
were  already  estab­ lished.  Moreover, one of 
the antecedents is textually



147





closer to its referent.  Figure 4 illustrates  the case 
when the English antecedent is closer to the referent 
than the Romanian one.
SWIZZLE  Solutions: (1) If the heuristic H(E) used
to resolve the reference in the English text has higher 
priority  than  H(R),  which was used to resolve the 
reference from  the  Romanian  text,  then  we first 
search for RT, the Romanian translation  of EA, the 
English antecedent.  In the next step, we add heuris­ 
tic Hl that resolves RR into RT, and give it a higher 
priority than H(R). Finally, we also add heuristic H2 
that links RT to RA when there is at least one trans­ 
lation between the elements of the coreference chains 
containing EA and ET respectively.
  (2) If H(R) has higher priority than  H(E), heuris­ 
tic H3 is added while H(E) is removed. We also add 
H4 that  relates ER to ET, the English translation  of 
RA.
Case 3 occurs when at least one of the antecedents 
starts  a new coreference chain (i.e., no coreferring
antecedent can be found in the current chains). 
SWIZZLE   Solution: 	If one  of  the   antecedents 
corefers with an element from a coreference chain, 
then the antecedent in the opposite language is its 
translation. 	Otherwise,  SWIZZLE  chooses the  an­ 
tecedent returned  by the heuristic with highest pri­ 
ority.

4    Results

The foremost contribution  of SWIZZLE was that  it 
improved coreference resolution over both  English 
and Romanian texts when compared to monolingual 
coreference resolution performance in terms of preci­ 
sion and recall. Also relevant was the contribution of 
SWIZZLE to the process of understanding the cultural 
differences expressed in language and the way these 
differences influence coreference resolution. Because 
we do not have sufficient space to discuss this issue 
in detail here, let us state,  in short, that  English is 
more economical than Romanian in terms of referen­ 
tial expressions. However the referential expressions 
in Romanian contribute to the resolution of some of 
the most difficult forms of coreference in English.

4.1   Precision and Recall

Table 4 summarizes the  precision results for both 
English and Romanian coreference. The results in­ 
dicate  that   the  English  coreference is  more  pre­ 
cise than  the  Romanian  coreference, but  SWIZZLE 
improves coreference resolution in both  languages. 
There were 64% cases when the English coreference 
was resolved by a heuristic with higher priority than 
the corresponding heuristic for the Romanian coun-


terpart.  This result explains why there is better pre­
cision enhancement for the English coreference.

Table 5: Coreference recall

  Table 5 also illustrates the recall results.   The 
advantage of the data-driven  coreference resolution 
over other methods is based on its better  recall per­ 
formance.  This is explained by the fact that this 
method captures a larger variety of coreference pat­ 
terns. Even though other coreference resolution sys­ 
tems perform better for some specific forms of refer­ 
ence, their recall results are surpassed by the data­ 
driven approach.   Multilingual coreference in turn 
improves more the  precision than  the  recall of the 
monolingual data-driven  coreference systems.
In addition, Table 5 shows that  the English coref­
erence results in better  recall than Romanian coref­ 
erence. However, the recall shows a decrease for both 
languages for SWIZZLE because imprecise coreference 
links are deleted.   As is usually the  case, deleting 
data lowers the recall. All results were obtained by 
using the  automatic  scorer program developed for 
the MUC evaluations.

5    Conclusions

We have introduced  a new data-driven  method for 
multilingual coreference resolution, implemented in 
the  SWIZZLE  system.    The  results  of this  method 
are encouraging since they show clear improvements 
over monolingual coreference resolution.  Currently, 
we are also considering the  effects of a bootstrap­ 
ping algorithm for multilingual coreference resolu­ 
tion.  Through  this  procedure we would learn con­ 
currently semantic consistency knowledge and bet­ 
ter  performing heuristic  rules.   To be able to  de­ 
velop such a learning approach, we must first develop a 
method for automatic  recognition of multilingual 
referential expressions.

  We also believe that  a better  performance evalu­ 
ation  of SWIZZLE can  be achieved by measuring  its 
impact  on several complex applications. We intend 
to  analyze  the  performance of SWIZZLE when  it  is 
used as a module in an IE system, and separately in 
a Question/ Answering system.
