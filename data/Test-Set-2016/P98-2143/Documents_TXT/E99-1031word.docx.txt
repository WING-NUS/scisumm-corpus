Abstract

This  paper  describes  an  architecture 
for performing anaphora resolution in 
a flexible way.  Systems which con­ 
form to these guidelines are well­ 
encapsulated   and  portable,   and  can 
be used  to compare  anaphora  resolu­ 
tion techniques for new language un­ 
derstanding applications.     Our im­ 
plementation   of   the  architecture   in 
a pronoun resolution testing platform 
demonstrates  the flexibility of the ap­ 
proach.

1   Introduction

When   building   natural   language  understand­ 
ing systems, choosing the best technique for 
anaphora resolution is a challenging task.  The 
system builder must decide whether to adopt an 
existing  technique  or  design  a  new  approach. 
A  huge  variety of  techniques  are  described  in 
the literature, many of them achieving high suc­ 
cess  rates  on  their  own  evaluation  texts  (cf. 
Hobbs 1986; Strube 1998; Mitkov 1998).   Each 
technique makes different assumptions about the 
data available to reference resolution, for ex­ 
ample, some assume perfect parses, others as­ 
sume only POS-tagged input, some assume se­ 
mantic information is available, etc. The chances 
are  high  that  no  published  technique  will  ex­ 
actly match the data available to a particular sys­ 
tem's  reference resolution component, so it may

not be apparent which method will work best. 
Choosing a technique is especially  problematic 
for designers of dialogue systems trying to pre­ 
dict how anaphora resolution techniques devel­ 
oped for written monologue will perform when 
adapted for spoken dialogue.  In an ideal world, 
the system designer would implement and com­ 
pare many techniques on the input data available 
in his system.  As a good software engineer, he 
would also ensure that any pronoun resolution 
code he implements can be ported to future ap­ 
plications or different language domains without 
modification.
  The architecture described in this paper was 
designed to provide just that functionality. 
Anaphora resolution code developed within the 
architecture  is encapsulated  to ensure  portabil­ 
ity across parsers, language genres and domains. 
Using these architectural guidelines, a testbed 
system for comparing pronoun resolution tech­ 
niques has been developed at the University of 
Rochester. The testbed provides a highly config­ 
urable environment which uses the same pronoun 
resolution code regardless of the parser front-end 
and language type under analysis. It can be used, 
inter alia, to compare anaphora resolution tech­ 
niques for a given application, to compare new 
techniques to published baselines, or to compare 
a particular technique's  performance across lan­ 
guage types.

2   The Architecture

2.1   Encapsulation of layers

Figure I  depicts the organization of the architec­ 
ture.  Each of the three layers have different re­ 
sponsibilities:









Layer 1:Supervisor layer controls which  Translation and  Anaphora resolution modulcs arc active for  the current test.

• Layer  1:  The  supervisor controls  which 
modules in Layers 2 and 3 execute.  In our 
implementation, the supervisor sets a run­ 
time switch for each module in layer 2 and
3, and the first instruction of each of those 
modules checks its runtime flag to see if it is 
active for the current experiment.
• Layer  2: Translation reads the input text
and  creates  the  main data  structure  used 
for reference resolution, called the discourse 
context (DC). The DC consists of discourse 
entities (DEs) introduced in the text, some of 
which are anaphoric. This layer contains all 
syntactic and semantic analysis components 
and all interaction with the surrounding sys­ 
tem, such as access to a gender database or 
a lexicon for semantic restrictions.  All fea­ 
tures that need to be available to reference 
resolution are posted to the DC. This layer 
is also responsible for deciding which input 
constituents create DEs.
• Layer  3:  Anaphora resolution  contains a
variety of functions for resolving different 
types of anaphora.   Responsibilities of this 
layer  include  determining  what  anaphoric 
phenomena are to be resolved in the current 
experiment, determining what anaphora res­ 
olution  technique(s)  will be used,  and de­ 
termining what updates to make to the DC. 
Even though the modules are independent of 
the input format, they are still somewhat de­ 
pendent on the availability of DE features. 
If a feature needed by a particular resolution 
module was not created in a particular ex­ 
periment, the module must either do without 
it or give up and exit. This layer's output is 
an updated DC with anaphoric elements re-


solved to their referents.  If labeled 
training data is available, this layer is 
also responsi­ ble for calculating the 
accuracy of anaphora resolution.

2.2   Benefits of this 
design

This strict delineation of responsibilities 
between layers provides the following 
advantages:
• Once  a  translation  layer  is  written  for  
a specific type of input, all the 
implemented anaphora resolution 
techniques are immedi­ ately available and 
can be compared.
• Different models of DC construction can 
be
compared using the same underlying 
refer­
ence resolution 
modules.
• It is simple  to  activate  or deactivate  
each
component of the system for a particular 
ex­
perime
nt.

Implementation

We used this architecture to implement a 
testing platform for pronoun resolution.  
Several experi­ ments were run to demonstrate  
the flexibility of the architecture. The purpose 
of this paper is not to compare the pronoun 
resolution results for the techniques we 
implemented, so pronoun  resolu­ tion 
accuracy of particular techniques will not be 
discussed here. 1    Instead, our implementation  
is described to provide some examples of 
how the architecture can be put to use.

3.1    Supervisor 
layer
The supervisor layer controls which modules 
within layers 2 and 3 execute for a particular 
ex­ periment.   We created  two different  
supervisor

       1 See (Byron and Allen. I 999; Tetreault. I 999) for 
results of pronoun resolution experiments  run within the 
testbed.











modules in the testbed. One of them simply reads 
a configuration file with runtime flags hard-coded 
by the user. This allows the user to explicitly con­ 
trol which parts of the system execute, and will be 
used when a final reference resolution techniques 
is chosen for integration into the TRIPS system 
parser (Ferguson and Allen, 1998).
  The second supervisor layer was coded as a ge­ 
netic algorithm (Byron and Allen, 1999). In this 
module, the selection of translation layer modules 
to execute was hard-coded for the evaluation cor­ 
pus, but pronoun  resolution modules and meth­ 
ods for combining their results were activated and 
de-activated by the genetic algorithm. Using pro­ 
noun resolution accuracy as the fitness function, 
the algorithm learned an optimal combination of 
pronoun resolution modules.

3.2    Translation  layer

Translation layer modules are responsible for all 
syntactic and semantic analysis of the input text. 
There are a number of design features that must 
be controlled in this layer, such as how the dis­ 
course structure affects antecedent accessibility 
and which surface constituents trigger DEs.  All 
these design decisions should be implemented as 
independent modules so that they can be turned 
on or off for particular experiments.
  Our  experiments  created translation modules 
for  two evaluation  corpora:   written  news sto­ 
ries from the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et 
al.,   1993)  and  spoken  task-oriented  dialogues 
from the TRAINS93 corpus (Heeman and Allen,
1995). The input format and features added onto 
DEs from these two corpora are very different, 
but  by encapsulating  the translation  layer,  the 
same  pronoun  resolution code  can  be used for 
both domains.   In both of our experiments only 
simple noun phrases in the surface form triggered 
DEs.
  Treebank texts contain complete structural 
parsers, POS tags, and annotation of the 
antecedents   of   definite   pronouns   (added   by 
Ge eta!.  1998).  Because of the thorough syntac­ 
tic information, DEs can be attributed with ex­ 
plicit phrase structure information.   This corpus 
contains unconstrained news stories, so semantic 
type information is not available.  The Treebank 
translator module adds the following features to


each DE:

1. Whether its surface constituent is contained 
in reported speech;
2. A list of parent nodes containing its surface 
constituent in the parse tree.  Each node's 
unique  identifier encodes  the  phrase  type 
(i.e. VB, NP, ADJP);
3. Whether the surface constituent is in the sec­
ond half of a compound sentence;
4. The referent's animacy and gender from a 
hand-coded agreement-feature database.

  A second translation module was created for a 
selection of TRAINS93 dialogue transcripts. The 
input was POS-tagged words with no structural 
analysis. Other information, such as basic punc­ 
tuation and whether each pronoun was in a main 
or subordinate clause, had previously been hand­ 
annotated onto the transcripts. We also created an 
interface to the semantic type hierarchy within the 
Trains system and added semantic information to 
the DEs.
Common DE attributes for both corpora:

1. Plural or singular numeric agreement;
2. Whether the entity is contained in the subject 
of the matrix clause;
3. Linear position of the surface constituent;
4. Whether its surface constituent is definite or 
indefinite;
5. Whether its surface constituent is contained 
in quoted speech;
6.  For pronoun DEs, the id of the correct an­
tecedent (used for evaluation).

3.3   Anaphora resolution layer

Modules within this layer can be coded to resolve 
a variety of anaphoric phenomena in a variety of 
ways. For example, a particular experiment may 
be concerned only with resolving pronouns or it 
might also require determination  of coreference 
between definite noun phrases. This layer is rem­ 
iniscent of the independent anaphora resolution 
modules in the Lucy system (Rich and LuperFoy,
1988), except that modules in that system were
not designed to be easily turned on or off.
  For our testbed, we implemented a variety of 
pronoun  resolution techniques.   Each technique

Table I: Pronoun resolution modules used in our experiments



can run in isolation or with the addition of meta­ 
modules that combine the output of multiple tech­ 
niques.	We implemented  meta-modules  to in­ 
terface to the genetic algorithm driver and to 
combine different salience factors into an over­ 
all score (similar to (Carbonell and Brown, 1988; 
Mitkov, 1998)).   Table 1 describes  the pronoun 
resolution techniques implemented at this point, 
and shows whether they are activated for the 
Treebank and the TRAINS93 experiments.   Al­ 
though each module could run for both experi­ 
ments without error, if the features a particular 
module uses in the DE were not available, we 
simply de-activated the module.  When we mi­ 
grate  the TRIPS  system  to a new  domain  this 
year, all these pronoun resolution methods will be 
available for comparison.

4   Summary

This paper has described a framework for ref­ 
erence resolution that separates details of the 
syntactic/semantic interpretation process from 
anaphora resolution in a plug-and-play architec­ 
ture.  The approach is not revolutionary, it sim­ 
ply demonstrates  how to apply known software 
engineering  techniques  to the reference  resolu­ 
tion component of a natural language understand­ 
ing system.    The  framework  enables  compari­ 
son of baseline techniques across corpora and al­ 
lows for easy modification of an implemented 
system when the sources of information available 
to anaphora resolution change.  The architecture 
facilitates experimentation on different mixtures 
of discourse context and anaphora resolution al­ 
gorithms. Modules written within this framework 
are portable across domains  and  language gen­ 
res.
