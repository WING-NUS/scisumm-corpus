			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Coreference evaluation was introduced as a new domain:-independent task at the 6th Message Under· standing Conference (MUC6) in 1995.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">The task fo­ cused on a subset of coreference, namely the identity coreference, established between nouns, pronouns and noun phrases (including proper names) that re­ fer to the same entity.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">In defining the coreference task (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">(Hirschman and Chinchor, 1997)) special care was taken to use the coreference output not only for supporting Information Extraction(IE), the central task of the MUCs, but aJso to create means for research on coreference and discourse phenomena independent of IE.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Annotated corpora were made available, using SGML tagging within the text stream.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">The anno­ tated texts served as training examples for a variety of coreference resolution znethods, that had to focus not only on precision and recall, but also on robust­ ness.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Two general classes of approaches were distin­ guished.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">The first class is characterized by adapta­ tions of previously known reference algorjthms (e.g.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">(Lappin and Leass, 1994), (Brennan et al., 1987)) the scarce syntactic and semantic knowledge avail­ able in an IE system (e.g.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">(Kameyama, 1997)).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">The second class is based on statistical and machine learning techniques that rely on the tagged corpora Steven J. Maiorano AA T Washington, D.C. 20505 stevejmGucia.go v to extract features of the coreferential relations (e.g.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">(Aone and Bennett, 1994) (Kehler, 1997)).</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">In the past two MUC competitions, the high scor­ ing systems achieved a recall in the high 50&apos;s to low 60&apos;s and a precision in the low 70&apos;s (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">(Hirschman et al., 1998)).</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">A study1 of the contribution . of each form of coreference to the overall performance · shows that generally, proper name anaphora resolu­ tion have the highest precision (69%}, followed by pronominal reference (62%).</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">The worse -precision is obtained by the resolution of definite nominals anaphors (46%).</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">However, these results need to be contrasted with the distribution of coreferentiallinks on the tagged corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">The majority of coreference links (38.42%) connect names of people, organiza­ tions or locations.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">In addition, 19.68% of the tagged coreference links are accounted by appositives.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Only 16.35% of the tagged coreferences are pronominal.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Nominal anaphors account for 25.55% of the coref ·.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">erence links, and th6&apos;r resolution is generally poorly represented in IE systems.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">Due to the distribution of coreference links in newswire texts, a coreference module that is merely capable of handling recognition of appositives with high· precision and incorporates rules of name alias identification can achieve a baseline coreference pre­ cision up to 58.1%, without sophisticated syntactic or discourse information.</S>

			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">(Lappin and Leass, 1994)) to nominal coreference as well.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">Such enhancements rely on semantic and discourse knowledge.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">In this paper we desaibe COCKTAIL, a high­ performance coreference resolution system that op­ erates on a mixture of heuristics that combine se­ mantic and discourse information.</S>

			<S sid ="38" ssid = "1">Coreference resoiution relies on a combination of lin­ g_uistic ancognitive aspects of language.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "2">Linguis­ tic constramts are proyided mostly by the syntactic modeling of language, whereas computational mod­ of discourse bring forward the cognitive assump­ &quot;tlons of anaphora resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "3">Three different meth­ ods of combining anaphoric constraints are known to date.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "4">The first one integrates anaphora resolution in computational models of discourse interpretation.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "5">Dynamic properties of discourse, especially focusing and centering are invoked as the primary basiS for.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "6">identifying antecedents.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "7">Such computational meth­ ods were presented in (Grosz et al., 1995) and (Web- ber, 1988).</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "8">· A second category of approaches combines a va.­ riety of syntactic, semantic and discourse factors as a multidimensional metric for ranking antecedent candidates.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "9">Anaphora resolution is determined by a composite of several distinct scoring procedures each of which scores the prominence of the candi with respect to a specific . type of information.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "10">The systems described in (Asher and Wada, 1988) (Car­ bonell and Brown, 1988) and (Rich and Luperfoy, 1988) are examples of the mixed evaluation strat­ egy.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "11">Alternatively, other discourse-based methods con­ sider coreference resolution a byproduct of the recognition of coherence relations between sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "12">Such methods were presented in (Hobbs et al., 1993) and {Wilensky, 1978).</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "13">Although AI-complete, this approach has the appeal that it resolves the most compUcated cases of coreCerence, uncovered by syn­ tactic or semantic cues.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "14">We have revisited these methods by setting the relation between coreference and coherence on empirical grounds.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "15">2.1 Pronominal Coreference.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "16">Two tendencies characterize current pronominal coreference algorithms.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "17">The first one makes use of the advances in the parsing technology or on the availability of large parsed corpora (e.g. &apos;1\-eebank (Marcus et al.1993)) to&quot; produce algorithms inspired by Hobbs&apos; b eline method (Hobbs, 1978).</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "18">For ex­ ample, .the Resolution of Anaphora Procedure (RAP) introduced in (Lappin and Leass, 1994) combines syntactic information with agreement and salience constraints.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "19">Recently, a probabilistic approach to pronominal coreference resolution was also devised (Ge et al., 1998), using the parsed data available from Treebank.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "20">The knowledge-based method of Lappin and Leass produces better results.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "21">Never­ theless, RAPSTAT,a version of RAP obtained by using statistically measured preference patterns for the an­ tecedents, produced a slight enhancem nt of perfor­ mance over RAP.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "22">Other pronominal resolution approaches promote knowledge-poor methods (Mitkov, 1998), eitper by using an ordered set of general heuristics or by combining scores assigned to candidate antecedents.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "23">The CogNIAC algorithm {Baldwin, 1997) uses six heuristic rules to resalv.e coreference, whereas the algorithm presented in (Mitkov, 1998) is based on a limited set of preferences (e.g. definitiveness, l cal reiteration or immediate reference).</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "24">BOth these al­ gorithm rely only on part-of-sptagging of texts and on patterns for NP identification.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "25">Their per­ formance (close to 90% for certain types of pro­ nouns) indicates that full syntactic knowledge is not required by certain forms of pronominal coreference.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "26">The same claim is made in (Kennedy and Bogu . raev, 1996) and (Kameyama, 1997), where algo­ rithms approximating RAP for poorer syntactic input obtain precision of 75% and 71%, respectively, a sur­ prising small precision decay frdm RAP&apos;s 86%.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "27">These results prompted us to devise COCKTAIL, a corefer­ ence resolution system, as a mixture of heuristics·· performing on the various syntactic, semantic.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "28">and discourse cues.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "29">COCKTAIL is a composite of heuris­ tics learned from the tagged corpora, which has the following novel characteristics: 1.</S>

			<S sid ="69" ssid = "32">We have devised sepa­ rate heuristics for reflexive, possessive, relative, 3rd person and 1st person pronouns.</S>
