			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">In written text, cohesion occurs when some elements in a discourse are dependent on others and that refer to items backward in the text, both in the spoken or written text (Halliday and Hassan, 1976).</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Consider the following example (1.1) Shah Rukh Khan is off to one of his favorite cities- London, with his family.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Now he is looking for another destination, not so much for holidaying though.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">(The News Islamabad: June 2006) (1.2) Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu has been signed for her new film Corporate.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">She is a single working woman, wants to get somewhere in life, on her own terms.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">(The News Islamabad: June 2006) 81 Cohesion in examples 1.1 and 1.2 is introduced due to the terms he, his, her, she and interpretation of these references depends upon some preceding terms.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">These referring terms are called anaphors or anaphoric devices (ADs).</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Halliday and Hassan described anaphora as ‘cohesion which points back to some previous items’ (Halliday and Hassan, 1976).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">The ‘pointing back’ words or phrases are called the anaphors (Halliday and Hassan, 1976) and the entities to which these point are called antecedents and the procedure of determining the antecedents of anaphors and subsequent replacement in some particular discourse is called anaphora resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">According to Halliday and Hassan when anaphors are replaced by their corresponding antecedents, cohesion no more exists.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Personal anaphoric devices (ADs) are the most widely used variety of ADs in Urdu text.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">These are further classified as first person, second person and third person anaphoric devices.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Examples of first person ADs are ،ﮟﻴﻣ ،اﺮﻴﻣ ،ﯼﺮﻴﻣ ﻮﮑﻤه ،ﯼرﺎﻤه ،ارﺎﻤه ،ﻢه ،ﻮﮑﻬﺠﻣ ،ﮯﻬﺠﻣ،،ﮟﻴﻤه ےرﺎﻤه ([mæIri], [mæIra], [mæñ], [mʊʤheI], [mʊʤhkəƱ], [hΛm], [hΛmɒrɒ], [hΛmɒri], [hΛmkəƱ], [hΛmeIñ], [hΛmɒreI]).</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Examples of second person ADs are،ﻢﺗ ﻮﮑﻤﺗ ،ﯼرﺎﻬﻤﺗ ،ارﺎﻬﻤﺗ، ﺎﻬﻤﺗ،ﮟﻴﻬﻤﺗ،ےرﻮﮑﭘﺁ ،ﯽﮑﭘﺁ ،ﺎﮑﭘﺁ ،پﺁ ([tʊm], [tʊmhɒrɒ], [tʊmhɒri], [tʊmkƏƱ], [tʊmheIñ], [tʊmhɒreI], [a:p] [a:pkɒ], [a:pki], [a:pkƏƱ]).</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Examples of third person ADs are ،ﮦو ،ﮯﺳا ،ﺎﮑﺳا ،ﯽﮑﺳا ،ﮯﮑﺳا ،ﻮﮑﺳا ،نا ،ﯽﮑﻧا ،ﮯﮑﻧا ،ﺎﮑﻧا ﮟﻴﻬﻧا ([vәƱh], [ʊseI], [ʊskɒ], [ʊski], [ʊskeI], [ʊskƏƱ], [ʊn], [ʊnki], [ʊnkeI], [ʊnkɒ], [ʊnheIñ]).</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">A lot of work has been done in English for the purpose of anaphora resolution and various Proceedings of the IJCNLP08 Workshop on NLP for Less Privileged Languages, pages 81–90, Hyderabad, India, January 2008.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">Qc 2008 Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing algorithms have been devised for this purpose (Aone and Bennette, 1996; Brenan , Friedman and Pollard, 1987; Ge, Hale and Charniak, 1998; Grosz, Aravind and Weinstein, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Lappins and Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 1998; Soon, Ng and Lim, 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Work has also been done in South Asian Languages such as Hindi and Malayalam for the purpose of anaphora resolution (Prasad and Strube, 2000; Sobha, 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Prasad and Strube (2000) worked on anaphora resolution in Hindi.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Their approach relies on the discourse salience factors and is primarily inspired by the central idea of Centering theory (Grosz, Aravind and Weinstein, 1995).</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">Centering theory has also guided the development of pronoun resolution algorithms, such as the BFP algorithm (Brenan, Friedman and Pollard, 1987) and the S-list algorithm developed by Strube (Strube, 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">Prasad and Strube (2000) applied these algorithms to the resolution of pronouns in Hindi texts.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">They showed that the BFP algorithm cannot be successfully implemented for pronoun resolution in Hindi.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">They argued that better results can be obtained with an algorithm that does not use the Centering notions of the backward-looking center and the centering transitions for the computation of pronominal antecedents, such as the S-list algorithm (Prasad and Strube, 2000).</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">Prasad and Strube used well established approaches for Hindi anaphora resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">Sobha (1998) used knowledge poor rule based approach for reference resolution in Hindi and Malayalam languages that stands on very limited syntactic information.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">In Urdu language very little work has been done on discourse level especially in the field of anaphora resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">Although, most of the anaphoric devices in Urdu and Hindi are same but the style and organization of discourses are bit different that causes the difference in anaphora resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">Kulsoom et al worked on Urdu anaphora resolution but it appears to be the tip of an iceberg (Kalsoom and Rashida, 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">Kulsoom et al (1993) only considered the morphological and lexical filters for the resolution of anaphora in Urdu discourses.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">However, these filters are not sufficient for Urdu anaphora resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section-2 describes the factors that play a vital role in Urdu anaphora resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">Section-3 presents algorithms, implementation and evaluation for the resolution of personal anaphora; this is followed by the conclusion.</S>

			<S sid ="40" ssid = "1">anaphora resolution Factors that can play a very important role in Urdu anaphora resolution beside morphological and lexical filters are topicalized structures, subject preferences, object preferences, repetitions, section heading and distance.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "2">How these factors are helpful in anaphora resolution in English language was worked out by Mitkov (Mitkov, 1998), but their role in Urdu discourse for the resolution of personal pronouns is more cherished.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "3">How these factors are helpful in the resolution of anaphoric devices in Urdu is done by Khan et al (Khan, Ali and Aamir, 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "4">Ali et al also worked on these factors for the resolution of demonstrative ADs in Urdu discourse (Ali, Khan and Aamir, 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "5">2.1 Morphological and lexical filters.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "6">Consider an example in which anaphora is resolved on the basis of morphological filters.</S>

			<S sid ="52" ssid = "13">Here the morphological filters are used for anaphoric disambiguation.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "14">In the above discourse, terminal of sentence is ﺎﻬﺗ ([thɒ]) that indicates the third person AD ﮦو refers to singular and masculine NP i.e. ﻦﻳد ﻞﻀﻓ ([fΛzl][dIn]).</S>
