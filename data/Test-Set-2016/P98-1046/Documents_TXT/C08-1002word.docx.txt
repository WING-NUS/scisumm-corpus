Abstract

VerbNet (VN) is a major large-scale En- 
glish verb lexicon. Mapping verb instances 
to their VN classes has been proven use- 
ful for several NLP tasks. However, verbs 
are polysemous with respect to their VN 
classes.  We introduce a novel supervised 
learning model for mapping verb instances 
to VN classes, using rich syntactic features 
and class membership constraints.   We 
evaluate the algorithm in both in-domain 
and corpus adaptation scenarios.  In both 
cases, we use the manually tagged Sem- 
link WSJ corpus as training data.  For in- 
domain (testing on Semlink WSJ data), we 
achieve 95.9% accuracy, 35.1% error re- 
duction (ER) over a strong baseline.  For 
adaptation, we test on the GENIA corpus 
and achieve 72.4% accuracy with 10.7% 
ER. This is the first large-scale experimen- 
tation with automatic algorithms for this 
task.

1   Introduction

The organization of verbs into classes whose mem- 
bers exhibit similar syntactic and semantic behav- 
ior has been discussed extensively in the linguistics 
literature (see e.g. (Levin and Rappaport Hovav,
2005; Levin, 1993)).  Such an organization helps 
in avoiding lexicon representation redundancy and 
enables generalizations across similar verbs.   It 
can also be of great practical use, e.g.    in com- 
pensating NLP statistical models for data sparse- 
ness. Indeed, Levin’s seminal work had motivated

much research aimed at automatic discovery of 
verb classes (see Section 2).
  VerbNet (VN) (Kipper et al., 2000; Kipper- 
Schuler, 2005) is a large scale, publicly available 
domain independent verb lexicon that builds on 
Levin classes and extends them with new verbs, 
new classes, and additional information such as 
semantic roles and selectional restrictions.  VN 
classes were proven beneficial for Semantic Role 
Labeling (SRL) (Swier and Stevenson, 2005), Se- 
mantic Parsing (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005) and 
building conceptual graphs (Hensman and Dun- 
nion, 2004).   Levin-inspired classes have been 
used in several NLP tasks, such as Machine Trans- 
lation (Dorr, 1997) and Document Classification 
(Klavans and Kan, 1998).
  Many applications that use VN need to map verb 
instances onto their VN classes.  However, verbs 
are polysemous with respect to VN classes. Sem- 
link (Loper et al., 2007) is a dataset that maps each 
verb instance in the WSJ Penn Treebank to its VN 
class. The mapping has been created using a com- 
bination of automatic and manual methods. Yi et 
al. (2007) have used Semlink to improve SRL.
  In this paper we present the first large-scale ex- 
perimentation with a supervised machine learning 
classification algorithm for disambiguating verb 
instances to their VN classes. We use rich syntactic 
features extracted from a treebank-style parse tree, 
and utilize a learning algorithm capable of impos- 
ing class membership constraints, thus taking ad- 
vantage of the nature of our task. We use Semlink 
as the training set.
  We evaluate our algorithm in both in-domain 
and corpus adaptation scenarios.   In the former, 
we test on the WSJ (using Semlink again), ob- 
taining 95.9% accuracy with 35.1% error reduc- 
tion (ER) over a strong baseline (most frequent

class) when using a modern statistical parser.  In 
the corpus adaptation scenario, we disambiguate 
verbs in sentences taken from outside the train- 
ing domain.  Since the manual annotation of new 
corpora is costly, and since VN is designed to be 
a domain independent resource, adaptation results 
are important to the usability in NLP in practice. 
We manually annotated 400 sentences from GE- 
NIA (Kim et al., 2003), a medical domain cor- 
pus1 .   Testing on these, we achieved 72.4% ac- 
curacy with 10.7% ER. Our adaptation scenario 
is complete in the sense that the parser we use 
was also trained on a different corpus (WSJ). We 
also report experiments done using gold-standard 
(manually created) parses.
  The most relevant previous works addressing 
verb instance class classification are (Lapata and 
Brew, 2004; Li and Brew, 2007; Girju et al., 2005). 
The former two do not use VerbNet and their ex- 
periments were narrower than ours, so we can- 
not compare to their results. The latter mapped to 
VN, but used a preliminary highly restricted setup 
where most instances were monosemous.   For 
completeness, we compared our method to theirs2 , 
achieving similar results.
  We review related work in Section 2, and dis- 
cuss the task in Section 3. Section 4 introduces the 
model, Section 5 describes the experimental setup, 
and Section 6 presents our results.

2   Related Work

VerbNet.  VN is a major electronic English verb 
lexicon.   It is organized in a hierarchical struc- 
ture of classes and sub-classes, each sub-class in- 
heriting the full characterization of its super-class. 
VN is built on a refinement of the Levin classes, 
the intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998), 
aimed at achieving more coherent classes both se- 
mantically and syntactically.  VN was also sub- 
stantially extended (Kipper et al., 2006) using the 
Levin classes extension proposed in (Korhonen 
and Briscoe, 2004). VN today contains 3626 verb 
lemmas (forms), organized in 237 main classes 
having 4991 verb types (we refer to a lemma with 
an ascribed class as a type).   Of the 3626 lem- 
mas,  912 are polysemous (i.e.,  appear in more 
than a single class). VN’s significant coverage of


75.5% coverage of VN classes over PropBank3 
instances (Loper et al., 2007).   Each class con- 
tains rich semantic information, including seman- 
tic roles of the arguments augmented with se- 
lectional restrictions, and possible subcategoriza- 
tion frames consisting of a syntactic description 
and semantic predicates with temporal informa- 
tion.  VN thematic roles are relatively coarse, vs. 
the situation-specific FrameNet role system or the 
verb-specific PropBank role system, enabling gen- 
eralizations across a wide semantic scope.  Swier 
and Stevenson (2005) and Yi et al. (2007) used VN 
for SRL.
  Verb type classification.  Quite a few works 
have addressed the issue of verb type classification 
and in particular classification to ‘Levin inspired’ 
classes (e.g., (Schulte im Walde, 2000; Merlo and 
Stevenson, 2001)).  Such work is not comparable 
to ours, as it deals with verb type (sense) rather 
than verb token (instance) classification.
  Verb token classification.  Lapata and Brew 
(2004) dealt with classification to Levin classes of 
polysemous verbs.  They established a prior from 
the BNC in an unsupervised manner.  They also 
showed that this prior helps in the training of a 
naive Bayes classifier employed to distinguish be- 
tween possible verb classes of a given verb in a 
given frame (when the ambiguity is not solved by 
knowing the frame alone). Li and Brew (2007) ex- 
tended this model by proposing a method to train 
the class disambiguator without using hand-tagged 
data.  While these papers have good results, their 
experimental setup was rather narrow and used 
only at most 67 polysemous verbs (in 4 frames). 
VN includes 912 polysemous verbs, of which 695 
appeared in our in-domain experiments.
  Girju et al. (2005) performed the only previous 
work we are aware of that addresses the problem of 
token level verb disambiguation into VN classes. 
They treated the task as a supervised learning prob- 
lem, proposing features based on a POS tagger, a 
Chunker and a named entity classifier.  In order 
to create the data4 , they used a mapping between 
Propbank rolesets and VN classes, and took the in- 
stances in WSJ sections 15-18,20,21 that were an- 
notated by Propbank and for which the roleset de- 
termines the VN class uniquely.  This resulted in
most instances being in fact monosemous.  Their

experiment was conducted in a WSJ in-domain 
scenario, and in a much narrower scope than in 
this paper. They had 870 (39 polysemous) unique 
verb lemmas, compared to 2091 (695 polysemous) 
in our in-domain scenario. They did not test their 
model in an adaptation scenario.  The scope and 
difficulty contrast between our setup and theirs are 
demonstrated by the large differences in the num- 
ber of instances and in the percentage of polyse- 
mous instances: 972/12431 (7.8%) in theirs, com- 
pared to 49571/84749 (58.5%) in our in-domain 
scenario (training+test). We compared our method 
to theirs for completeness and achieved similar re- 
sults.
  Semlink. The Semlink project (Yi et al., 2007; 
Loper et al., 2007) aims to create a mapping of 
PropBank, FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), Word- 
Net (henceforth WN) and VN to one another, thus 
allowing these resources to synergize. In addition, 
the project includes the most extensive token map- 
ping of verbs to their VN classes available today. 
It covers all verbs in the WSJ sections of the Penn 
Treebank within VN coverage (out of 113K verb 
instances, 97K have lemmas present in VN).

3   Nature of the Task

Polysemy is a major issue in NLP. Verbs are not an 
exception, resulting in a single verb form (lemma) 
appearing in more than a single class.  This pol- 
ysemy is also present in the original Levin clas- 
sification, where polysemous classes account for 
more than 48% of the BNC verb instances (Lapata 
and Brew, 2004).
  Given a verb instance whose lemma is within 
the coverage of VN, given the sentence in which 
it appears, given a parse tree of this sentence (see 
below), and given the VN resource, our task is to 
classify the verb instance to its correct VN class. 
There are currently 237 possible classes5 .   Each 
verb has only a few possible classes (no more than
10, but only about 2.5 on the average over the poly- 
semous verbs). Depending on the application, the 
parse tree for the sentence may be either a gold 
standard parse or a parse tree generated by a parser. 
We have experimented with both options.
  The task can be viewed in two complemen- 
tary ways: per-class and per-verb type.  The per- 
class perspective takes into consideration the small

5 We ignore sub-class distinctions. This is justified since in
98.2% of the in-coverage instances in Semlink, knowing the


number of classes relative to the number of types6 . 
A classifier may gather valuable information for all 
members of a certain VN class, without seeing all 
of its members in the training data. From this per- 
spective the task resembles POS tagging. In both 
tasks there are many dozens (or more) of possible 
labels, while each word has only a small subset of 
possible labels.  Different words may receive the 
same label.
  The per-verb perspective takes into consider- 
ation the special properties of every verb type. 
Even the best lexicons necessarily ignore certain 
idiosyncratic characteristics of the verb when as- 
signing it to a certain class.  If a verb appears 
many times in the corpus, it is possible to estimate 
its parameters to a reasonable reliability, and thus 
to use its specific distributional properties for dis- 
ambiguation.  Viewed in this manner, the task re- 
sembles a word sense disambiguation (WSD) task: 
each verb has a small distinct set of senses (types), 
and no two different verbs have the same sense.
  The similarity to WSD suggests that our task 
might be solved by WN sense disambiguation fol- 
lowed by a mapping from WN to VN. However, 
good results are not to be expected, due to the 
medium quality of today’s WSD algorithms and 
because the mapping between WN and VN is both 
incomplete and many-to-many7 . Even for a perfect 
WN WSD algorithm, the resulting WN synset may 
not be mapped to VN at all or may be mapped onto 
multiple VN classes.  We experimented with this 
method and obtained results below the MF base- 
line we used8 .
  The above discussion does not rule out the pos- 
sibility of obtaining reasonable results through ap- 
plying a high quality WSD engine followed by a 
WN to VN mapping.  However, there are much 
fewer VN classes than WN classes per verb. This 
may result in the WSD engine learning many dis- 
tinctions that are not useful in this context, which 
may in turn jeopardize its performance with re- 
spect to our task.  Moreover, a word sense may 
belong to a single verb only while a VN class con- 
tains many verbs. Consequently, the performance

6 237 classes vs. 4991 types.
    7 In the WN to VN mapping built into VN, 14.69% of the 
covered WN synsets were mapped to more than a single VN 
class.
    8 We used the publicly available SenseLearner 2.0, the VB- 
Collocations model.  We chose VN classes containing the 
lemma in random when a single mapping is not specified. We 
obtained 67.74% accuracy on section 00 of the WSJ, which is



on a certain lemma may benefit from training in- 
stances of other lemmas.
  Note that our task is not reducible to VN frame 
identification (a non-trivial task given the rich- 
ness of the information used to define a frame 
in VN). Although the categorizing criterion for 
Levin’s classification is the subset of frames the 
verb may appear in (equivalently, the diathesis al- 
ternations the verbal proposition may perform), 
knowing only the frame in which an instance ap- 
pears does not suffice, as frames are shared among 
classes.

4   The Learning Model

As common in supervised learning models, we en- 
code the verb instances into feature vectors and 
then apply a learning algorithm to induce a clas- 
sifier. We first discuss the feature set and then the 
learning algorithm.
  Features. Our feature set heavily relies on syn- 
tactic annotation.  Dorr and Jones (1996) showed 
that perfect knowledge of the allowable syntactic 
frames for a verb allows 98% accuracy in type as- 
signment to Levin classes. This motivates the en- 
coding of the syntactic structure of the sentence 
as features, since we have no access to all frames, 
only to the one appearing in the sentence.
  Since some verbs may appear in the same syn- 
tactic frame in different VN classes, a model rely- 
ing on the syntactic frame alone would not be able 
to disambiguate instances of these verbs when ap- 
pearing in those frames.  Hence our features in- 
clude lexical context words.  The parse tree en- 
ables us to use words that appear in specific syn- 
tactic slots rather than in a linear window around 
the verb.  To this end, we use the head words of 
the neighboring constituents. The definition of the 
head of a constituent is given in (Collins, 1999).
  Our feature set is comprised of two parallel sets 
of features.  The first contains features extracted 
from the parse tree and the verb’s lemma as a stan- 
dalone feature. In the second set, each feature is a 
conjunction of a feature from the first set with the 
verb’s lemma.  By doing so we created a general 
feature space shared by all verbs, and replications 
of it for each and every verb. This feature selection 
strategy was chosen in view of the two perspec- 
tives on the task (per-class and per-verb) discussed 
in Section 3.
  Our first set of features encodes the verb’s con- 
text as inferred from the sentence’s parse tree (Fig-

ure 1).  We attempt to encode both the 
syntactic frame, by encoding the tree structure, 
and the ar- gument preferences, by encoding the 
head words of the arguments and their POS. The 
restriction on the verb’s parent being the head 
constituent of its grandparent is done in order to 
focus on the correct verb in verb series such as 
‘intend to run’.
  The 3rd cell in the table makes use of a ‘sec- 
ond head word’ node, defined as follows. 
Consider a left sibling (right siblings are 
addressed analo- gously) M  of the verb’s node.  
Take the node H in the subtree of M where M 
’s head appears.  H is a descendent of a node J 
which is a child of M . The ‘second head word’ 
node is J ’s sibling on the right. For example, in 
the sentence We went to school (see Figure 2) the 
head word of the PP ‘to school’ is ‘to’, and the 
‘second head word’ node is
‘school’. The rationale is that ‘school’ could be 
a useful feature for ‘went’, in addition to ‘to’, 
which is highly polysemous (note that it is also a 
feature for ‘went’, in the 1st and 2nd cells of the 
table). The voice feature was computed using a 
simple heuristic based on the verb’s POS tag (past 
partici- ple) and presence of auxiliary verbs to its 
left.

  Learning Algorithm. Our learning task can be 
formulated as follows.  Let xi  denote the feature 
vector of an instance i, and let X denote the space 
of all such feature vectors.  The subset of possi- 
ble labels for xi  is denoted by Ci, and the correct
label by ci   ∈ Ci.   We denote the label space by
S. Let T be the training set of instances T = {<
x1, C1 , c1 >, < x2, C2 , c2 >, ..., < xn, Cn, cn  >
} ⊆ (X  × 2S  × S)n, where n is the size of the
training set. Let < xn+1, Cn+1  >∈ (X  × 2S ) be
a new instance. Our task is to select which of the
labels in Cn+1 is its correct label cn+1 (xn+1 does 
not have to be a previously observed lemma, but 
its lemma must appear in a VN class).
  The structure of the task lets us apply a learn- 
ing algorithm that is especially appropriate for it. 
What we need is an algorithm that allows us to re- 
strict the possible labels of each instance, both in 
training and in testing. The sequential model algo- 
rithm presented by Even-Zohar and Roth (2001) 
directly supports this requirement.  We use the 
SNOW learning architecture for multi-class clas- 
sification (Roth, 1998), which contains an imple- 
mentation of that algorithm 9 .

5   Experimental Setup

We used SemLink VN annotations and parse trees 
on sections 02-21 of the WSJ Penn Treebank for 
training, and section 00 as a development set, as 
is common in the parsing community.  We per- 
formed two parallel sets of experiments, one us- 
ing manually created gold standard parse trees and 
one using parse trees created by a state-of-the-art

  9 Experiments on development data revealed that for verbs 
for which almost all of the training instances are mapped to 
the same VN class, it is most beneficial to select that class. 
Thus, where more than 90% of the training instances of a verb 
are mapped to the same class, our algorithm mapped the in- 
stances of the verb to that class regardless of the context.


results are known to be of much lower quality than 
in-domain results (Lease and Charniak, 2005). The 
quality of the discriminative parser we used did 
indeed decrease in our adaptation scenario (Sec- 
tion 7).
  The training data included 71209 VN in-scope 
instances (of them 41753 polysemous) and the de- 
velopment 3624 instances (2203 polysemous). An
‘in-scope’ instance is one that appears in VN and 
is tagged with a verb POS. The same trained model 
was used in both the in-domain and adaptation sce- 
narios, which only differ in their test sets.
In-Domain.	Tests  were  held  on  sections
01,22,23,24 of WSJ PTB. Test data includes all in- 
scope instances for which there is a SemLink anno- 
tation, yielding 13540 instances, 7798 (i.e., 57.6%) 
of them polysemous.
  Adaptation. For the testing we annotated sen- 
tences from GENIA (Kim et al., 2003) (version
3.0.2). The GENIA corpus is composed of MED- 
LINE abstracts related to transcription factors in 
human blood cells.  We annotated 400 sentences 
from the corpus, each including at least one in- 
scope verb instance.   We took the first 400 sen- 
tences from the corpus that met that criterion11 . 
After cleaning some GENIA POS inconsistencies, 
this amounts to 690 in-scope instances (380 of 
them polysemous). The tagging was done by two 
annotators with an inter-annotator agreement rate 
of 80.35% and Kappa 67.66%.
  Baselines. We used two baselines, random and 
most frequent (MF). The random baseline selects 
uniformly and independently one of the possible 
classes of the verb. The most frequent (MF) base- 
line selects the most frequent class of the verb in 
the training data for verbs seen while training, and 
selects in random for the unseen ones.  Conse- 
quently, it obtains a perfect score over the monose- 
mous verbs.  This baseline is a strong one and is 
common in disambiguation tasks.
We repeated all of the setup above in two sce-

narios.  In the first (main) scenario, in-scope in- 
stances were always mapped to VN classes, while 
in the second (‘other is possible’ (OIP)) scenario, 
in-scope instances were allowed to be tagged (dur- 
ing training) and classified (during test) as not be- 
longing to any existing VN class12 .  In all cases, 
out-of-scope instances (verbs whose lemmas do 
not appear in VN) were ignored. For the OIP sce- 
nario, we used a different ‘other’ label for each of 
the lemmas, not a single label shared by them all.

6   Results

Table 1 shows our results. In addition to the over- 
all results, we also show results for the polysemous 
ones alone, since the task is trivial for the monose- 
mous ones. The results using gold standard parses 
effectively set an upper bound on our model’s per- 
formance, while those using statistical parser out- 
put demonstrate its current usability.
In-Domain.  Results are shown in the WSJ →
WSJ columns of Table 1.   Using gold standard
parses (top), we achieve 96.42% accuracy over- 
all.  Over the polysemous verbs, the accuracy is
93.68%. This translates to an error reduction over 
the MF baseline of 43.35% overall and 43.22% for 
the polysemous verbs.  In the ‘other is possible’ 
scenario (right), we obtained 36.67% error reduc- 
tion. Using a state-of-the-art parser (Charniak and 
Johnson, 2005) (bottom), we experienced some 
degradation of the results (as expected), but they 
remained significantly above baseline. We achieve
95.9% accuracy overall and 92.77% for the polyse- 
mous verbs, which translates to about 35.13% and
35.04% error reduction respectively.  In the OIP
scenario, we obtained 28.95% error reduction.
  The results of the random baseline for the in- 
domain scenario are substantially worse than the 
MF baseline.  On the WSJ the random baseline 
scored 66.97% (37.51%) accuracy in the main 
(OIP) scenarios.
  Adaptation.  Here we test our model’s ability 
to generalize across domains.  Since VN is sup- 
posed to be a domain independent resource, we 
hope to acquire statistics that are relevant across 
domains as well and so to enable us to automati- 
cally map verbs in domains of various genres. The
results are shown in the WSJ → GENIA columns
of Table 1. When using gold standard parses, our
model scored 73.16%.   This translates to about
13.17% ER on GENIA. We interestingly experi-

12i.e., including instances tagged by SemLink as ‘none’.


enced very little degradation in the results when 
moving to parser output, achieving 72.4% accu- 
racy which translates to 10.71% error reduction 
over the MF baseline. The random baseline on GE- 
NIA was again worse than MF, obtaining 66.04% 
accuracy as compared to 69.09% of MF (in the OIP 
scenario, 39.12% compared to 46.41%).
  Run-time performance.  Given a parsed cor- 
pus, our main model trains and runs in no more
than a few minutes for a training set of ∼60K in-
stances and a test set of ∼11K instances, using a
Pentium 4 CPU 2.40GHz with 1GB main mem-
ory. The bottleneck in tagging large corpora using 
our model is thus most likely the running time of 
current parsers.

7   Discussion

In this paper we introduced a new statistical model 
for automatically mapping verb instances into 
VerbNet classes, and presented the first large-scale 
experiments for this task, for both in-domain and 
corpus adaptation scenarios.
Using gold standard parse trees, we achieved
96.42%  accuracy  on  WSJ  test  data,  showing
43.35% error  reduction  over  a  strong  baseline. 
For adaptation to the GENIA corpus, we showed
13.1% error reduction over the baseline.  A sur- 
prising result in the context of adaptation is the lit- 
tle influence of using gold standard parses versus 
using parser output, especially given the relatively 
low performance of today’s parsers in the adapta- 
tion task (91.4% F-score for the WSJ in-domain 
scenario compared to 81.24% F-score when pars- 
ing our GENIA test set). This is an interesting di- 
rection for future work.
  In addition, we conducted some additional pre- 
liminary experiments in order to shed light on 
some aspects of the task. The experiments reported 
below were conducted on the development data, 
given gold standard parse trees.
  First, motivated by the close connection be- 
tween WSD and our task (see Section 3), we con- 
ducted an experiment to test the applicability of 
using a WSD engine.  In addition to the experi- 
ments listed above, we also attempted to encode 
the output of a modern WSD engine (the VBCollo- 
cations Model of SenseLearner 2.0 (Mihalcea and 
Csomai, 2005)), both by encoding the synset (if 
exists) of the verb instance as a feature, and by en- 
coding each possible mapped class of the WSD 
engine output synset as a feature.   There are k

Table 1: Accuracy and error reduction (ER) results (in percents) for our model and the MF baseline. 
Error reduction is computed as M ODEL− M F . Results are given for the WSJ and GENIA corpora test
100−M F
sets.  The top table is for a model receiving gold standard parses of the test data.  The bottom is for a
model using (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) state-of-the-art parses of the test data. In the main scenario 
(left), instances were always mapped to VN classes, while in the OIP one (right) it was possible (during 
both training and test) to map instances as not belonging to any existing class. For the latter, no results 
are displayed for polysemous verbs, since each verb can be mapped both to ‘other’ and to at least one 
class.



features if there are k possible classes13 .   There 
was no improvement over the previous model. A 
possible reason for this is the performance of the 
WSD engine (e.g. 56.1% precision on the verbs in 
Senseval-3 all-words task data).  Naturally, more 
research is needed to establish better methods of 
incorporating WSD information to assist in this 
task.
  Second, we studied the relative usability of class 
information as opposed to verb idiosyncratic infor- 
mation in the VN disambiguation task.  By mea- 
suring the accuracy of our model, first given the 
per-class features (the first set of features exclud- 
ing the verb’s lemma feature) and second given the 
per-verb features (the conjunction of the first set 
with the verb’s lemma), we tried to address this 
question.  We obtained 94.82% accuracy for the 
per-class experiment, and 95.51% for the per-verb 
experiment, compared to 95.95% when using both 
in the in-domain gold standard scenario. The MF 
baseline scored 92.45% on this development set. 
These results, which are close in the per-class ex- 
periment to those of the MF baseline, indicate that 
combining both approaches in the construction of 
the classifier is justified.
  Third, we studied the importance of having a 
learning algorithm utilizing the task’s structure 
(mapping into a large label space where each in-

  13The mapping is many-to-many and partial. To overcome 
the first issue, given a WN sense of the verb, we encoded all 
possible VN classes that correspond to it.  To overcome the 
second, we treated a verb in a certain VN class, for which the 
mapping to WN was available, as one that can be mapped to 
all WN senses of the verb.


stance can be mapped to only a small subspace). 
Our choice of the algorithm in (Even-Zohar and 
Roth, 2001) was done in light of this requirement. 
We conducted an experiment in which we omitted 
these per-instance restrictions on the label space, 
effectively allowing each verb to take every label 
in the label space. We obtained 94.54% accuracy, 
which translates to 27.68% error reduction, com- 
pared to 95.95% accuracy (46.36% error reduc- 
tion) when using the restrictions. These results in- 
dicate that although our feature set keeps us sub- 
stantially above baseline even without the above 
algorithm, using it boosts our results even further. 
This result is different from the results obtained 
in (Girju et al., 2005), where the results of the un- 
constrained (flat) model were significantly below 
baseline.
  As  noted  earlier,  the  field of  instance  level 
verb classification into Levin-inspired classes is far 
from being exhaustively explored.  We intend to 
make our implementation of the model available 
to the community, to enable others to engage in 
further research on this task.
