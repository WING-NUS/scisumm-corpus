Abstract 
 
A method for the definition of verb predicates
is proposed. The definition of the predicates is
essentially tied to a semantic interpretation al-
gorithm that determines the predicate for the
verb, its semantic roles and adjuncts. As predi-
cate definitions are complete, they can be tested
by running the algorithm on some sentences and
verifying the resolution of the predicate, seman-
tic roles and adjuncts in those sentences. The
predicates are defined semiautomatically with
the help of a software environment that uses
several sections of a corpus to provide feedback
for the definition of the predicates, and then for
the subsequent testing and refining of the defi-
nitions. The method is very flexible in adding a
new predicate to a list of already defined pred-
icates for a given verb. The method builds on
an existing approach that defines predicates for
WordNet verb classes, and that plans to define
predicates for every English verb. The defini-
tions of the predicates and the semantic inter-
pretation algorithm are being used to automat-
ically create a corpus of annotated verb predi-
cates, semantic roles and adjuncts.
 
 
1 Introduction
 
 
This paper deals with the definition of verb
predicates which will make possible the deter-
mination of verb meaning, semantic roles, ad-
juncts, and attachment and meaning of post-
verbal PPs. Hence, the adequacy of the defini-
tions is measured by comparing the output of a
semantic interpretation algorithm with the so-
lution of those semantic interpretation tasks on
sentences randomly taken from any corpus, or
typed by a user at the console. The algorithm,
thus, must provide immediate feedback by test-
ing the definitions on these randomly selected
sentences. In (Gomez, 2001), generic predicates
have been defined for WordNet 1.6 (henceforth,
WN) verb classes (Fellbaum, 1998). The se-
mantic roles of the predicates are linked to the
selectional restrictions (categories in WordNet
ontology for nouns) and the grammatical rela-
tions that realize them. The selectional restric-
tions of the predicates are solidly grounded on
the WordNet ontology for nouns (Miller, 1998),
whose upper level ontology has been modified
and rearranged (Gomez, 2004) based on the
feedback obtained by testing the predicate def-
initions.
However, we have found out that the ini-
tial idea in that work of defining predicates for
a WN verb class which will be also valid for
most of the verbs under that class has proven
to be too optimistic because many of the verb
forms included under that class realize their
semantic roles by different selectional restric-
tions and grammatical relations. This is due to
the fact that many of the verbs under a given
class have been grouped in many instances by
some kind of implication, or troponymy (Fell-
baum, 1998), rather that by sharing seman-
tic roles in a hierarchy of predicates. Even
in many cases, some of the verbs in the same
synset list differ semantically and syntactically
between them. For instance, the third sense of
&amp;quot;gain&amp;quot; in WN is: &amp;quot;profit, gain, benefit (derive
benefit from).&amp;quot; The theme, the thing obtained,
is syntactically realized by the PP [from NP]
for two of the verbs listed in that synset &amp;quot;bene-
fit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;profit,&amp;quot; while the theme for &amp;quot;gain&amp;quot; is
realized by a direct object. The differences in
grammatical relations are even more prevailing
within the verbs under one given class. But,
in those cases in which the verb polysemy is
not high, one predicate definition for the verb
class may apply to many of the verb forms un-
der that class. Notwithstanding these problems,
WN verb classes have provided an important
basis for the construction of a general ontology
of predicates that will cover every English verb.
Moreover, if one considers that there are 5752
verbs in WordNet 1.6 having only one sense and
2199 verbs having exactly two senses, the pred-
icates that have been constructed for the verb
classes of 7,951 verbs are very close to be done.
However, the method explained in this paper
deviates considerably from the WN approach
to constructing verb meaning. In particular, it
eschews the synset list in favor of predicate def-
initions for individual verbs as opposed to a list
of synonymous verbs, and allows for an easy in-
tegration of a new predicate into a list of already
defined predicates for a given verb.
Briefly, the algorithm (Gomez, 2001) that
tests the predicates is as follows. For every verb
in a sentence, we provide a list of predicates
for that verb. These predicates can be viewed
as contenders for the meaning of the verb. The
goals of the algorithm are to select one predicate
from that list, thus determining the sense of the
verb, identify its semantic roles, and adjuncts
and attach post-verbal PPs. All these tasks are
simultaneously achieved. For each grammati-
cal relation (CR) in the clause (starting with
the NP complements) and for every predicate in
the list of predicates, the algorithm checks if the
predicate explains the CR. A predicate explains
a CR if there is a semantic role in the predi-
cate realized by the grammatical relation and
the selectional restrictions of the semantic role
subsume the ontological category of the head
noun of the grammatical relation. This process
is repeated for each CR in the clause and each
predicate in the list of predicates for the verb
of the clause. Then, the predicate that explains
the most CRs is selected as the meaning of the
verb. The semantic roles of the predicate have
been identified as a result of this process. In
case of ties, the predicate that has the greatest
number of semantic roles realized is selected.
Every grammatical relation that has not been
mapped to a semantic role must be an adjunct
or an NP modifier. The entries for adjuncts are
stored in the root node action or description (for
stative verbs) and are inherited by all predicates
in those categories. Adjuncts are identified after
the predicate of the verb has been determined
because adjuncts are not part of the argument
structure of the predicate.
In the next section, we will show how to de-
fine predicates for individual verbs as different
from WN verb classes, how these predicates for
individual verbs can reuse entries in the generic
predicates for WordNet verb classes, and how
they are integrated into the ontology of pred-
icates that have been defined with the help of
WN verb classes. Section 3 provides a discus-
sion of the semiautomatic construction of the
predicates. Section 4 gives a view of the upper-
level ontology of predicates, section 5 discusses
the testing, and sections 6 and 7 related research
and conclusions, respectively.
 
 
2 Defining Predicates for Individual
Verbs
 
 
The approach to defining predicates for indi-
vidual verbs is similar to the way in which the
senses for a verb are given in a dictionary. The
difference lies in the level of detail provided. For
each verb sense, one must provide: a) a predi-
cate and a hierarchy where to insert it, b) the
semantic roles for the predicate, and c) the se-
lectional restrictions and grammatical relations
for each role. Of course, in the construction of
the definitions one must keep in mind the in-
terpretation algorithm because the definitions
must determine verb meaning, semantic roles
and adjuncts. Except for that, our approach
is similar to a dictionary definition in the sense
that the predicates for that verb are listed in the
same way as the senses of a verb are listed in the
dictionary. The lexical definition of the pred-
icates is a frame-like representation containing
the selectional restrictions followed by the gram-
matical relations for that role given those selec-
tional restrictions. The syntax for a semantic
role is:
 
 
(role ( (&lt;slr&gt;) (&lt;grs&gt;)
(&lt;slr&gt;) (&lt;grs&gt;)
(&lt;slr&gt; (&lt;grs&gt;))))
 
 
Where &lt; sir &gt; stands for any number of se-
lectional restrictions, and &amp;quot;&lt; grs &gt;&amp;quot; for any
number of grammatical relations. The order in
which the grammatical relations are listed is ir-
relevant. However, the order of the selectional
restrictions is relevant in the sense that the first
selectional restriction that matches is selected
and the others in the list are not tried. Hence,
the list of selectional restrictions is a preference
list (Wilks, 1975). This preference list is criti-
cal in selecting the correct sense for many head
nouns in the noun phrases of the verb argu-
ments.
A selectional restriction preceded by the sign
&amp;quot;-&amp;quot; (-sir) means that the semantic role is not re-
alized by that ontological category. The gram-
matical relations for PPs are represented by
writing &amp;quot;prep&amp;quot; followed by the prepositions that
realize the semantic role, e.g. (prep about on
...). Some of the grammatical relations are:
subj (the sentence has a subject), subj-if-obj
(the sentence has a subject and a direct ob-
ject), obj (direct object), obj2 (second post-
verbal NP), cp (any complement clause), cp-
inf (an infinitival complement clause), cp-that-
clause (a complement clause introduced by a
that clause), cp-ing (a complement clause in-
troduced by gerund), prep-cp (a complement
clause introduced by a preposition), etc.
Suppose that one wants to define predicates
for the verb &amp;quot;gain.&amp;quot; The first three predicates
are:
 
 
(gain
[gain-weight ;gain9 in WN
(is-a(c-change-state-of-animate))
(agent (human animal)(subj-if-obj))
(theme (we ight _unit 1 ) (obj ) )]
[gain-reach-a-location;gain4 in WN
(is-a(reach-a-location))
(to-lc(location) (obj))]
[gain-possession;gain8in WN
(is-a(transfer-of-possession))
(theme(possession)(obj))
 
 
(from-poss(human-agent)((prep from)))
(source-t(-human-agent thing)
((prep from))(prep-cp by from)))]
We have included the WN verb senses following
the predicate, but they can be omitted. The
reason for putting them is to produce an out-
put that can be checked against WN verb senses
(see Section 5). We could have also included
the sense numbers of Longman Dictionary of
Contemporary English (Longman Group, UK
Limited), one of the dictionaries that we have
consulted in constructing the predicates. The
first predicate gain-weight is a subpredicate of c-
change-state-of-animate, cause-change-of-state-
of-animate-being, which has been already de-
fined for a class of WN verbs. In fact, one
does not need to indicate the agent role because
it is already indicated in its parent predicate.
The only roles that one needs to list are those
that differ from those in its immediate super-
predicate. The predicate gain-reach-a-location
is a subpredicate of reach-a-location, which has
been already defined in principle for all WN
verb forms that fall under the synsets &amp;quot;reachl&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;scale4.&amp;quot; The to-/c role, which is identi-
cal to the parent predicate, does not need to
be listed either. Hence, all the work already
done in defining predicates for WN classes can
be reused in defining predicates for individual
verbs which, because of their high degree of
polysemy, cannot be handled by the predicates
defined for WN verb classes. The predicate
gain-possession expresses the sense of the verb
when the things gained are money, assets, etc.
When the source of the things transferred are
humans or social groups (&amp;quot;human-agent&amp;quot; stands
for humans or social groups) the semantic role is
called from-poss, e.g. &amp;quot;She gained much money
from the firm.&amp;quot; The role source-t is used when
the source is not a human-agent, e.g, &amp;quot;He gained
much money from the mines or from/by selling
the estate.&amp;quot; The preposition that realizes this
role is &amp;quot;from.&amp;quot; The prep-cp stands for a com-
plement clause introduced by a preposition(s).
In this case, the prepositions &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; (from sell-
ing) and &amp;quot;by&amp;quot; (by selling). The -human-agent
in the source-t indicates that this role is not
realized by the ontological category of human-
agent. The next two:
 
 
[gain-something;gainl,gain2,gain3 in WN
(is-a(transfer-of-something))
(theme (thing) (obj))
(from-poss(human-agent)((prep from)))
(source-t(-human-agent thing)
((prep from)) (prep-cp by from)))]
[gain-increase;gain6,gain7 in WN
( is-a ( increase) )
(agent (nil) (nil) )
 
 
(theme (substance magnitude process
action thing) (obj))
(belonging-to: theme (-human-agent
-animal thing) (subj-if-obj))]
 
 
The predicate gain-something is the most gen-
eral, because the selectional restriction of its
theme, thing, is the most general concept in
the ontology. This predicate will be also se-
lected by the algorithm as the second choice
for the verb &amp;quot;gain&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;She gained much money
from the lottery.&amp;quot; The first predicate will be
gain-possession and the second predicate gain-
something. If one does not want this to hap-
pen and limit the choices just to one predicate,
namely gain-possession, for this sentence, one
needs to rewrite the entry for the theme of gain-
something as: (theme (-possession thing)
(obj)). This will exclude the things that have
possession as a hypernym, or superconcept. The
predicate gain-something is a default predicate
for &amp;quot;gain.&amp;quot; That predicate contains implicitly
many predicates that are unanalyzed, in partic-
ular those whose theme is a nominal, e.g., &amp;quot;gain
control/independence/success, etc.&amp;quot; The mean-
ing of these predicates can be inferred, or gen-
erated from the meaning of the nominal.
The predicate gain-increase is a subpredicate
of increase. The entry &amp;quot;(agent(nil)(nil))&amp;quot; means
that this predicate does not have an agent, so
it will not inherit this role from any superpred-
icate. The meaning of this predicate expresses
those propositions in which entities other than
humans or animals gain something. The role
belonging-to:theme means that the filler of this
role is in the relationship of belonging-to to the
filler of the role theme. The relation belonging-
to is a very general relationship including many
other relations such as at-lc, attribute, and oth-
ers. This role is also shared by other predicates.
Thus, the analysis of the sentence &amp;quot;the pond
gained water&amp;quot; is something caused the water
belonging-to the pond to increase. In this sen-
tence, the belonging-to relation stands for at-lc,
something that can be inferred by additional
analysis of the ontology of the arguments of the
relation. A similar analysis is produced for &amp;quot;the
object gained speed uniformly.&amp;quot; Both sentences
can be rephrased by saying &amp;quot;the water in the
pond increased,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the speed of the object
increased.&amp;quot;
 
 
Order of the Predicates
 
 
As indicated, the order of the predicates is
relevant in the sense that, in case of ties (two or
more predicates realize all their semantic roles),
they will be preferred as the predicate for that
verb in the order in which they are defined.
This order has nothing to do with frequency
of senses for a given verb, but rather with the
generality of the ontological categories in the se-
lectional restrictions of the semantic roles. For
instance, had the predicate gain-weight been de-
fined after gain-something, gain-weight would
have been ranked second after gain-something
as the predicate of &amp;quot;gain&amp;quot; in the sentence &amp;quot;The
teacher gained weight.&amp;quot; If the ontological cat-
egory of the selectional restriction of at least
one role, says, r1, in predicate, say, pi, is not in
the same path as the selectional restriction of
role r1 in predicate pi, then it makes no differ-
ence in which order the predicates are defined.
That is the case for gain-weight and gain-reach-
a-location, because the ontological categories of
their themes are not in the same path.
The definition of the predicates is provided
without any knowledge about what could be
the meaning of the nouns in the sentence. The
goal is that the definition of the predicates help
determine the senses of the nouns as much as
possible. For instance, if one types the sen-
tence &amp;quot;the kite flew into the sky,&amp;quot; the system
selects two predicates for &amp;quot;fly&amp;quot;: the first one: fly
which is a subpredicate of change-location, (an
animate being changes location from a place to
another). This is so because one of the senses
of &amp;quot;kite&amp;quot; in WN is a hawk(kite2). Thus, kite2
is selected as the agent of fly. The second pred-
icate is cause-to-fly (a subpredicate of cause-
to-change-location), in which &amp;quot;kite&amp;quot; is taken as
plaything, a toy, (kitel). In this case, &amp;quot;kitel&amp;quot;
is the theme and the agent or inanimate-cause
are unknown. During one of our demos, some-
body typed the sentence &amp;quot;She left the keys in
her car,&amp;quot; and the system came up with the fol-
lowing two predicates for &amp;quot;left&amp;quot;: leave-a-place
and leave-behind. Our first reaction was that
something had gone very wrong in selecting the
predicate leave-a-place. But upon looking into
it, we found out that one of the senses for &amp;quot;keys&amp;quot;
in WN is the &amp;quot;Florida keys,&amp;quot; a location. Hence,
the interpretation of the system for &amp;quot;left&amp;quot; was
correct, given that sense for &amp;quot;keys,&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;some-
body left a place (the Keys) using her car as
the instrument for the change of location.
 
 
3 A software Environment for the
Semiautomatic Definition of
Predicates
 
 
We have developed a software environment that
has the following components: a parser, the se-
mantic interpreter that uses the predicates to
interpret the sentence, a corpus (The World
Book Encyclopedia, World Book, Inc. Chicago)
divided into different sections for defining, re-
fining and testing the predicate definitions, a
skimmer that searches for sentences in the cor-
pus containing the verb for which predicates are
being defined, and a mechanism for dragging
in sentences from the corpus into the system
for testing. An interface has been also imple-
mented for those who abhor Lisp parentheses.
The interface interactively asks for the semantic
roles, the selectional restrictions and the gram-
matical relations for a given predicate. Suppose
that one wants to define predicates for the three
senses of the verb &amp;quot;confuse&amp;quot; provided by Long-
man, namely &amp;quot;to cause to be mixed up in the
mind,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;to mix up in one&apos;s mind (with)&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;to put in disorder, make less clear or more dif-
ficult to deal with ..&amp;quot;
 
 
p1: [cause-to-confuse-perplex
(is-a(c-change-state-of-animate))
(agent (human-agentanimal)
(subj-if-obj))
(theme(human-agent animal)(obj))
(inanimate-cause (thing)
(subj-if-obj)1]
[confuse-something-with-something
(is-a (misunderstand) )
(agent (human-agent animal)
( subj -if -obj ) )
(theme (thing) (obj ) )
(co-theme (thing) ( (prep with) ) )
(require (co-theme) )]
P3:
[confuse-issue-muddy
(is-a (obscure-ideas-information) )
(agent (human-agent animal)
(subj -if -obj ) )
(theme (-physical-thing
communication thing) (obj ) )]
 
 
The first predicate is straightforward. The
inanimate-cause is needed because anything in
principle can cause to confuse a living thing,
e.g., &amp;quot;The light confused the bird and was
trapped,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;These questions confuse even the
experts.&amp;quot; The second predicate has no restric-
tions in the roles theme and co-theme. Anything
can in principle be confused with anything else.
The require slot can be used in any predicate
to indicate that in order for that predicate to
be selected by the algorithm as the meaning of
the verb, the role expressed in the require slot
must have been filled by the algorithm. This is
not absolutely needed in this case, but it min-
imizes the number of predicates selected for a
verb. Note that, if one removes the require slot
from p2, and one types the sentence &amp;quot;He con-
fused the teacher,&amp;quot; predicates p1 and p2 will
be selected because both predicates will explain
the two grammatical relations in the sentence.
However, if one types &amp;quot;She confused the crane
with a heron,&amp;quot; only p2 will be selected because
p2 will explain the PP [with a heron] and p1 will
not be able to. The selectional restriction of the
theme for predicate p3 is anything that is not a
physical-thing in the ontology, preferring those
concepts having communication as a hypernym.
There are two ways in which one can pro-
ceed in the definition of these predicates. One
way is to provide the definitions given above us-
ing the interface, which reduces to responding
to some commands/questions by the interface,
namely &amp;quot;enter role,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;enter selectional restric-
tions,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;enter grammatical relations for that
role,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;done with this role ?&amp;quot; etc. Then, once
the definitions are completed one can skim a
section of the corpus for sentences containing
the verb for which predicates are being defined
and try them (parse and interpret them) in the
system in order to test the definitions provided.
Most sentences are parsed and interpreted in
few seconds.
Another way is to skim the corpus for sen-
tences containing the verb for which predicates
are being defined, provide tentative definitions
based on the sentences retrived by the skim-
mer, and then refine and test the definitions by
searching the section of the corpus for refining
predicates, and loop as needed. The interface
provides with all kinds of functions for search-
ing the noun ontology, which facilitates greatly
the task of defining the predicates.
The placing of a predicate in the hierarchy of
predicates is a semiautomatic process. The in-
terface has a function that displays all the pred-
icates already built for all the WN senses for a
given verb. There are also functions that dis-
play the content of the predicates as well as all
their superpredicates and subpredicates. This
makes the insertion a rather simple task.
Adding a New Predicate
Suppose that one wants to add a new predi-
cate to a list of predicates for a given verb which
one thought it was complete. One may dis-
cover a new sense that WN or the dictionary
has missed, something not uncommon. This
is as simple as adding the new predicate def-
inition to the list of predicates for that verb.
Suppose that one wants to add the predicate
gain-a-reputation to the list of predicates for
the verb &amp;quot;gain,&amp;quot; because the verb &amp;quot;gain&amp;quot; is fre-
quently used with this concept. This predicate
is clearly a refinement of the predicate gain-
something. Hence it needs to be inserted be-
fore it. Prior to introducing the new predicate
one may want to check if there is a predicate
whose theme contains the selectional restriction
of &amp;quot;reputation,&amp;quot; or one of its hypernyms. This is
a task fully automated. One needs only to type:
(find-predicates (theme reputation1)). This will
retrieve all predicates whose theme has reputa-
tionl, or one of its hypernyms as its selectional
restriction. In this case, the predicate establish-
a-reputation that has standing1 as the selec-
tional restriction for the theme will be retrieved.
So, one needs only to insert the predicate gain-
a-reputation immediately before gain-something
as follows:
 
 
(gain-a-reputation
(is-a(establish-a-reputation)))
4 A Panorama of the Upper-level
Ontology of Predicates
 
 
We have defined 3,017 predicates. Some of
them are very complex, while others contain
just two or three semantic roles because other
roles are inherited from their superpredicates.
The major classes and some of their sub-
classes are briefly described. The first class
is cause-change-of-state with 609 subpredi-
cates. This class contains major subclasses with
very little relation to each other. Some ma-
jor subclasses (the number of predicates un-
der each class are given in parentheses fol-
lowing the class) are cause-change- of- state- of-
animate-being (140 subpredicates) which in turn
has subclasses such as arouse- f eeling s- emotions
(52) cause-to-act (19), injure-hurt-somebody-or-
oneself (18). Other major subclasses of cause-
change-of-state are: increase (31), improve (19),
worsen (10), terminate (16), physical-change-of-
state (14) (e.g., solidify, liquefy, etc.) cause-
change-of-integrity (22), transform (9) and oth-
ers.
The next predicate class is cause-to-
change-location with 379 predicates. The pri-
mary event expressed by this predicate is a
cause of change of location of something other
than the agent; although the agent may have
also changed location. In &amp;quot;Linda carried the
books to the library &amp;quot; the agent also has been
moved, but the primary event is the fact that
Linda caused a change of location of the books.
In a sentence such as &amp;quot;The moon circles the
earth,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the moon&amp;quot; is the theme and the agent
or inanimate-cause is unknown. The predicate
cause-to-change-location is not to be confused
with change-location (see next class) in which
the agent and the theme are the same animate
being, e.g., &amp;quot;Kelly went to the store.&amp;quot; The ma-
jor subclasses of cause-to-change-location
are: put (75), remove (53), transport (23), pro-
pel (20), connect (22), flow (12), and pull, push
and send with 9 predicates each.
The next class is change-location with 238
predicates. Major subclasses are: walk (14)
(some subpredicates of walk are hike, march,
sneak-walk, and others), enter (10), leave-a-
place (11), travel, arrive-to-a-place (10) and oth-
ers.
The next class is interact with 372 predi-
cates. Whithin this class, the major subclasses
are: communicate (243), treat-an-animal-or-
human (26), whose mayor subpredicates are
treat-unjustly-somebody, and behave (9), join-a-
group-or-a-human (9) and others.
The next class is transfer-of-something
with 293. Its major class is transfer-of-
possession (231), which in turn contains such
subpredicates as give (31), get (132) and others.
The next class is make-or-create-something
with 144 predicates. Some major subclasses
are initiate-something (30), create-art (28), pro-
duce (10), prepare-something (10) and oth-
ers. Another major class is judge with 182
predicates. Some of its subpredicates are
pass-a-negative-judgment-on (36) (e.g., disap-
prove, oppose-ideas, oppose-people, and oth-
ers.), put-value-to-something (12), praise (7),
accept-admit-a-fact (30), confirm-corroborate
(11), deny-something-to-somebody (14), accuse
(11) and others. The next class is experi-
ence with 110 predicates. Some of its sub-
classes are: feel-in-a-state-or-emotions (25),
perceive (21), like-something (36), experience-
event-state-abstraction (11) and others. The
next class is think with 115 predicates. Some of
its major subclasses are analyze (31), plan (13),
reason-conclude (9), associate (7) and others.
The next class is decide with 92 predi-
cates. Its major subclass is exert-control-over
(65), which in turn contains major subclasses
such as restrain(22) and manage (23). An-
other class is touch with 55 predicates. Its ma-
jor subclasses are handle-operate (18) and hit-
something (24). Another major class with 52
predicates is spend-something, which has in-
gest (31) as one of its main subclasses.
Some other predicate classes are: prevent
(45), move-body-position (33), know (31),
fail-to-do-something (33), fight (31), expel-
substance-from-the-body (23), do-act (27),
appoint-somebody (15), allow-something
(21), support-something (24), succeed (23),
and utilize (11). To these we need to add 223
predicates for stative verb senses (e.g. be-at-a-
place, include, etc.)
 
 
5 Testing
 
 
We have tested the predicates in 500 sentences
taken from the The World Book Encyclope-
dia. The manually corrected output of the se-
mantic interpreter on these 500 sentences has
been made public on November 26, 03 on the

These sentences and their subclauses contain
close to 400 distinct verbs. Many of these verbs
appear in the 500 sentence corpus several times
with different senses, while others appear just
one or two times. Space limitations prevent us
from listing the verbs in this paper. Table 1
summarizes the results of the semantic inter-
preter on these 500 sentences. We counted as
a correct predicate for the verb only the first
predicate selected by the algorithm. Semantic
roles were computed only for those predicates
which were correctly selected by the algorithm.
As one can see, the results are very good, and,
as a consequence, the manual correction of the
errors in the sentences takes very little time. In
fact, we have made public another set of 500
sentences on March 24, 2004. This new set of
sentences tests many verbs that did not appear
in the initial corpus, and which exhibit many
different senses. The preliminary results on this
new set are comparable to the results for the
first set. The selectional restrictions are aimed
at capturing the possible noun categories for
a given predicate, and are not biased to any
corpus. The main reasons for failing to assign
meaning to a constituent are: over-specification
or over-generalization of the selectional restric-
tions, missing a grammatical relation, sense not
contemplated in the predicate definitions for
that verb, and insufficient information in the
sentence to unequivocally determine the predi-
cate of the verb. The semantic interpreter has
become an excellent tool to automatically build
a corpus of annotated predicates, semantic roles
and adjuncts, requiring very little human effort
in validating and correcting the final output.
Our additions and restructuring to the upper
level noun ontology together with the prefer-
ence list in the selectional restrictions is mak-
ing possible for the interpreter to resolve many
noun senses, which otherwise would have re-
mained unresolved. Figure 1 depicts the out-
put of the interpreter for one of the sentence
in the initial corpus. The interpretation of the
sentences in the corpus include relativization,

complement phrases, coordination, subordina-
tion and adverbial clauses. The grammatical
relation is listed first followed by the semantic
role for that grammatical relation in the form
&lt; (semantic — role) &gt;. Hence, the pair &lt;&gt;
(placed to the right of the grammatical relation)
identifies semantic roles. The program prints
the predicate followed by the WN verb senses
and the phrase &amp;quot;supported by &apos;a-number&apos; SRs,&amp;quot;
(where &apos;a-number&apos; stands for a cardinal num-
ber), which indicates the number of grammat-
ical relations (SRs) that have realized seman-
tic roles. If the output for that sentence has
more semantic roles than the number listed in
the phrase &amp;quot;supported by,&amp;quot; those semantic roles
are adjuncts. Prepositions can be attached to
the verb with a confidence of strong or weak. All
post-verbal PPs deemed to be arguments of the
verb are attached as strong, while all PPs that
are deemed adjuncts can be attached as strong
or weak. The WN sense number for the verb
is printed in parentheses immediately following
the predicate. Sometimes more than one WN
verb sense is given for a predicate. For instance,
for the predicate travel-change-location given for
the verb &amp;quot;travel&amp;quot; in the sentence &amp;quot;She traveled
to Spain,&amp;quot; the following WN senses of &amp;quot;travel&amp;quot;
are listed (travell travel4 travel5). This means
that all WN senses of &amp;quot;travel&amp;quot; in that list are co-
alesced into the predicate travel-change-location
(Gomez, 2001). Hence, all these WN senses of
the verb have the same meaning. The WN noun
senses follow the noun in parentheses. In some
instances, the algorithm may provide more than
one sense for a noun. To the contrary to verb
senses, this list is a ranked list in which the
first noun sense listed by the algorithm is the
preferred one. Besides this output, the system
lists all the superpredicates of the predicates
selected for the verbs in the sentence. Thus,
open- an- enterprise is-a initiate- an- enterprise-
project is-a organize is-a initiate-something is-
a give-rise-to-something is-a make-or-create-
something, and charge-bill is-a transfer-of-
possession is-a transfer-of-something is-a ac-
tion.

This work has benefited from several sources.
In linguistics, the work reported in (Pritch-
ett, 1992; Grimshaw, 1990; Pinker, 1989) have
been influential. In computational linguistics,
the VerbNet project (Dang et al., 1998) and
Framenet (www.icsi.berkeley.edu/ framen,a)
(Fillmore et al., 2003) bear relation to this work.
Major differences are that our project aims at
defining predicates for every English verb in a
systematic manner, linking the selectional re-
strictions for their semantic roles to a well es-
tablished and widely used ontology for nouns,
namely WordNet, and placing them in a hierar-
chy of predicates where inferences and semantic
roles can be inherited. Moreover, the definition
of our predicates can be tested by running the
semantic interpretation algorithm on any cor-
pus or on sentences typed by the user at the
console.
 
 
7 Conclusions
 
 
An approach to building verb predicates has
been presented. The construction of the predi-
cates is essentially linked to an algorithm for de-
termining the semantic roles of the predicates.
The definitions of the predicates are done semi-
automatically and are being refined and tested
with the help of a semantic interpretation algo-
rithm that uses the definitions for determining
verb meaning and semantic roles for sentences
selected from a corpus, or entered at the ter-
minal. The algorithm and the predicates are
being used to automatically construct a corpus
of semantic annotated sentences.
