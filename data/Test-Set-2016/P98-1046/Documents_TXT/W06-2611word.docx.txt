Abstract

This article describes a robust  semantic 
parser that uses a broad knowledge base 
created  by interconnecting  three  major 
resources: FrameNet, VerbNet  and 
PropBank.  The FrameNet  corpus  con- 
tains  the examples  annotated  with se- 
mantic roles whereas the VerbNet  lexi- 
con provides  the knowledge  about  the 
syntactic  behavior of  the  verbs.   We 
connect VerbNet   and  FrameNet  by 
mapping  the FrameNet  frames  to the 
VerbNet Intersective Levin classes. The 
PropBank corpus, which is tightly con- 
nected to the VerbNet lexicon, is used to 
increase the verb coverage and also to 
test  the effectiveness  of our approach. 
The results indicate that our model is an 
interesting  step  towards  the design  of 
free-text semantic parsers.

1    Introduction

During the last years a noticeable effort has been 
devoted  to the design  of lexical  resources that 
can  provide the training  ground for automatic 
semantic role labelers. Unfortunately, most of the 
systems developed until now are confined to the 
scope of the resource that they use  during the 
learning stage.   A very recent example in this 
sense was provided by the CONLL 2005 Shared 
Task   on  PropBank   (Kingsbury   and   Palmer,
2002) role  labeling   (Carreras   and   Màrquez,
2005). While the best F-measure recorded  on a 
test set selected from the training corpus (WSJ)
was 80%, on the Brown corpus, the F-measure 
dropped below 70%. The most significant causes
for this performance decay were highly ambigu- 
ous and unseen predicates (i.e. predicates that do
not have training examples, unseen in the train- 
ing set).
    

On the FrameNet (Johnson et al., 2003) role 
labeling  task,  the Senseval-3  competition (Lit- 
kowski, 2004) registered similar results (~80%) 
by using the gold frame information as a given 
feature. No tests were performed outside Frame- 
Net. In this paper, we show that when the frame 
feature  is  not used, the  performance  decay  on 
different corpora  reaches 30 points. Thus, the 
context knowledge provided by the frame is very 
important  and  a free-text  semantic parser using 
FrameNet  roles  depends  on the accurate  auto- 
matic detection of this information.
    In order to test the feasibility of such a task, 
we have trained  an SVM  (Support Vector Ma- 
chine) Tree Kernel model for the automatic ac- 
quisition of the frame information. Although Fra- 
meNet contains three types of predicates (nouns, 
adjectives  and  verbs),  we  concentrated  on the 
verb  predicates  and  the roles  associated  with 
them. Therefore, we considered only the frames 
that have  at  least  one  verb  lexical  unit. Our 
experiments show that given a  FrameNet 
predicate-argument structure, the task of identi- 
fying the originating frame  can  be performed 
with very good results when the verb predicates 
have  enough  training  examples,  but becomes 
very challenging  otherwise.  The predicates  not 
yet included in FrameNet and the predicates be- 
longing to new application domains (that require 
new frames)  are  especially  problematic  as  for 
them there is no available training data.
    We have thus studied new means of captur- 
ing the semantic  context, other than the frame,
which can be easily annotated on FrameNet and
are available on a larger scale (i.e. have a better 
coverage). A very good candidate  seems to be
the Intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998)
that can be found as well in other predicate re- 
sources like  PropBank and VerbNet  (Kipper  et 
al., 2000).  Thus, we have designed a semi- 
automatic algorithm for assigning an Intersective 
Levin  class  to each FrameNet  verb  predicate.


The algorithm  creates a mapping  between  Fra- 
meNet frames and the Intersective Levin classes. 
By doing that we  could connect  FrameNet  to 
VerbNet  and PropBank and obtain an increased 
training set for the Intersective Levin class. This 
leads to better verb coverage and a more robust 
semantic parser. The newly created knowledge 
base allows us to surpass the shortcomings that 
arise  when  FrameNet,  VerbNet  and PropBank 
are used separately while, at the same time, we 
benefit from the extensive  research  involving 
each of them (Pradhan et al., 2004; Gildea and 
Jurafsky, 2002; Moschitti, 2004).
    We  mention  that there  are  3,672 distinct 
verb senses1 in PropBank and 2,351 distinct verb 
senses in FrameNet. Only 501 verb senses are in 
common  between the two corpora which mean
13.64% of PropBank and 21.31% of FrameNet. 
Thus, by training an Intersective Levin class 
classifier  on both PropBank  and FrameNet  we 
extend  the number  of available  verb  senses to
5,522.
    In the remainder  of this  paper, Section  2 
summarizes  previous  work done on FrameNet 
automatic role detection. It also explains in more 
detail why models based exclusively on this cor- 
pus are not suitable for free-text parsing. Section
3 focuses  on VerbNet  and PropBank  and how 
they can enhance the robustness of our semantic 
parser. Section 4 describes the mapping between 
frames and Intersective Levin classes whereas 
Section 5 presents the experiments that support 
our thesis. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the 
conclusions.

2    Automatic semantic role detection on
FrameNet

One of the goals of the FrameNet project  is to 
design a linguistic ontology that can be used for 
automatic processing of semantic information. 
This hierarchy contains an extensive semantic 
analysis of verbs, nouns, adjectives and situa- 
tions in which they are used, called frames. The 
basic assumption on which the frames are built is 
that each word evokes  a particular situation with 
specific participants (Fillmore, 1968). The situa- 
tions can be fairly simple depicting the entities 
involved and the roles they play or can be very 
complex and in this case they are called scenar- 
ios. The word that evokes  a particular frame is 
called  target word or predicate  and can be an


1 A verb sense is an Intersective Levin class in which 
the verb is listed.


adjective, noun or verb. The participant entities 
are  defined  using semantic  roles  and  they are 
called frame elements.
    Several models have been developed for the 
automatic detection of the frame elements based
on the FrameNet  corpus  (Gildea  and  Jurafsky,
2002; Thompson et al., 2003; Litkowski, 2004). 
While  the algorithms  used vary,  almost  all  the
previous studies divide the task into 1) the identi-
fication of the verb arguments to be labeled and
2) the tagging  of each  argument  with a  role. 
Also, most of the models agree on the core fea-
tures   as  being: Predicate,  Headword,  Phrase
Type, Governing Category, Position, Voice and
Path. These  are the initial  features  adopted by 
Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) (henceforth G&J) for 
both frame element identification and role classi- 
fication.
   A difference  among the previous  machine- 
learning models is whether the frame information
was  used as gold feature. Of particular  interest
for us is  the impact of the frame  over unseen 
predicates  and  unseen  words in general.    The
results  obtained  by G&J  are  relevant  in  this
sense;  especially,  the experiment  that uses  the 
frame to generalize from predicates seen in the 
training  data  to other predicates (i.e.  when no 
data is available for a target word, G&J use data 
from the corresponding frame). The overall per- 
formance induced by the frame usage increased.
   Other studies suggest that the frame is cru- 
cial when trying to eliminate the major sources
of errors. In their error analysis,  (Thompson et 
al., 2003) pinpoints that the verb arguments with
headwords that are “rare” in a particular  frame 
but not rare over the whole corpus are especially
hard to classify. For these cases the frame is very 
important because it provides the context infor- 
mation  needed  to distinguish  between different
word senses.
    Overall, the experiments presented in G&J’s 
study correlated with the results obtained in the
Senseval-3 competition show that the frame fea-
ture increases the performance and decreases the 
amount of annotated examples needed in training
(i.e.  frame  usage  improves  the generalization
ability of the learning algorithm).  On the other 
hand the results obtained without the frame in- 
formation are very poor.
   This behavior suggests that predicates in the 
same  frame  behave  similarly  in terms  of their
argument structure and that they differ with re- 
spect to other frames. From this perspective, hav- 
ing a broader  verb  knowledge base becomes  of
major importance for free-text semantic parsing.


   Unfortunately, the 321 frames that contain at 
least one verb predicate cover only a small frac- 
tion of the English verb lexicon and of possible 
domains. Also from these 321 frames only 100 
were  considered  to have  enough  training  data 
and  were  used  in  Senseval-3  (see  Litkowski,
2004 for more details).
   Our approach for solving such problems in- 
volves the usage of a frame-like feature, namely 
the Intersective  Levin  class.  We show that the 
Levin class is similar in many aspects to the 
frame and can replace it with almost no loss in 
performance. At the same time, Levin class pro- 
vides  better  coverage  as it can be learned  also 
from other corpora (i.e. PropBank). We annotate 
FrameNet with Intersective Levin classes by us- 
ing a  mapping   algorithm  that exploits  current 
theories  of linking. Our extensive  experimenta- 
tion shows the validity of our technique and its 
effectiveness  on corpora different  from Frame- 
Net.  The next section  provides  the theoretical 
support for the unified usage of FrameNet, 
VerbNet and PropBank, explaining why and how 
is possible to link them.

3    Linking   FrameNet  to  VerbNet  and
PropBank

In  general,  predicates  belonging to  the  same 
FrameNet frame have a coherent syntactic be- 
havior that is also different from predicates per- 
taining  to other frames  (G&J).  This  finding is 
consistent with theories of linking that claim that 
the syntactic behavior of a verb can be predicted 
from its semantics (Levin 1993, Levin and Rap- 
paport Hovav, 1996). This insight determined us 
to study the impact of using a feature based on 
Intersective  Levin  classes  instead  of the frame 
feature when classifying FrameNet  semantic 
roles. The main advantage of using Levin classes 
comes  from the fact  that  other resources  like 
PropBank and the VerbNet  lexicon contain this 
kind of information. Thus, we can train a Levin 
class classifier also on the PropBank corpus, 
considerably increasing the verb knowledge base 
at our disposal. Another  advantage derives from 
the syntactic criteria that were applied in defin- 
ing the Levin clusters. As shown later in this ar- 
ticle, the syntactic nature of these classes makes 
them easier to classify than frames, when using 
only syntactic and lexical features.
   More precisely, the Levin clusters are 
formed according to diathesis alternation criteria
which are variations in the way verbal arguments 
are grammatically expressed when a specific se-


mantic phenomenon arises. For example, two 
different types of diathesis alternations are the 
following:
(a)   Middle Alternation
[Subject, Agent The butcher] cuts [Direct Object, Patient the meat]. 
[Subject, Patient The meat] cuts easily.
(b)  Causative/inchoative Alternation
[Subject, Agent Janet] broke [Direct Object, Patient the cup]. 
[Subject, Patient The cup] broke.
   In both cases,  what is alternating is the 
grammatical function that the Patient role takes 
when changing  from the transitive  use  of the 
verb to the intransitive  one. The semantic  phe- 
nomenon accompanying these types of alterna- 
tions is the change of focus from the entity per- 
forming the action to the theme of the event.
   Levin documented 79 alternations which 
constitute   the  building  blocks  for  the   verb
classes. Although alternations are chosen  as the
primary means for identifying the classes, addi- 
tional properties related to subcategorization, 
morphology  and extended meanings of verbs are 
taken into account as well. Thus, from a syntactic 
point of view, the verbs in one Levin class have a 
regular behavior,  different  from the verbs per- 
taining to other classes. Also, the classes are se- 
mantically coherent and all verbs belonging to 
one class share the same participant roles.
   This constraint of having the same semantic 
roles is further ensured inside the VerbNet lexi-
con that is constructed  based on a more  refined
version of the Levin classification called Inter- 
sective  Levin  classes  (Dang  et al.,  1998). The
lexicon  provides  a regular  association  between
the syntactic and semantic properties of each of 
the described  classes.  It also  provides  informa- 
tion about the syntactic frames (alternations) in 
which the verbs participate and the set of possi- 
ble semantic roles.
   One corpus associated  with  the VerbNet 
lexicon is PropBank. The annotation scheme of 
PropBank ensures that the verbs belonging to the 
same Levin class share similarly labeled argu- 
ments. Inside one Intersective Levin class, to one 
argument  corresponds  one semantic  role num- 
bered  sequentially  from Arg0 to Arg5. Higher 
numbered argument labels are less consistent and 
assigned per-verb basis.
    The Levin classes were constructed based on 
regularities  exhibited  at  grammatical  level  and
the resulting clusters were shown to be semanti-
cally coherent. As opposed, the FrameNet frames 
were build on semantic bases, by putting together 
verbs, nouns and adjectives that evoke the same 
situations. Although different in conception, the


FrameNet verb clusters and VerbNet  verb clus- 
ters have common properties2:
(1)  Coherent syntactic  behavior  of verbs inside  one 
cluster,
(2)  Different  syntactic  properties  between  any  two
distinct verb clusters,
(3)  Shared set of possible semantic roles for all verbs 
pertaining to the same cluster.
Having these insights, we have assigned a corre- 
spondent VerbNet  class not to each verb predi- 
cate but rather to each frame.  In doing this we 
have applied  the simplifying  assumption  that a 
frame  has  a  unique corresponding Levin  class. 
Thus, we have created a one-to-many  mapping 
between the Intersective  Levin  classes  and  the 
frames. In order to create  a  pair 〈FrameNet 
frame,  VerbNet  class〉,  our mapping  algorithm 
checks both the syntactic  and semantic  consis- 
tency by comparing the role frequency distribu- 
tions on different syntactic positions for the two


to 3 elements  then we  form a  pair 〈FrameNet 
frame, VerbNet class〉 that qualifies for the 
second step of the algorithm.
   Only the frames  that have more  than three 
verb lexical units are candidates for this step 
(frames  with less  than 3 members  cannot  pass 
condition (II)).  This  excludes  a  number   of 60 
frames that will  subsequently be mapped 
manually.

VerbNet classes

The mapping algorithm  consists  of three steps: 
(a)  we  link  the frames  and  Intersective  Levin 
verb  classes  that have  the  largest  number of 
verbs in common  and we  create a set of pairs
〈FrameNet frame, VerbNet class〉 (see Figure 1); 
(b) we refine the pairs obtained in the previous
step  based  on diathesis  alternation  criteria,  i.e. 
the verbs pertaining to the FrameNet frame have 
to undergo  the same  diathesis  alternation  that
characterize  the corresponding  VerbNet   class
(see  Figure  2) and (c) we manually  check and 
correct  the resulting  mapping. In the next sec-
tions we will explain in more detail each step of
the mapping algorithm.

4.1	Linking  frames  and Intersective  Levin 
classes based on common verbs

During the first phase of the algorithm, given a 
frame, we compute its intersection with each 
VerbNet class.  We  choose as candidate for the 
mapping the Intersective Levin class that has the 
largest  number of verbs  in common with the 
given frame (Figure 1, line (I)). If the size of the 
intersection between the FrameNet frame and the 
candidate VerbNet  class is bigger than or equal



2 For FrameNet, properties 1 and 2 are true for most 
of the frames but not for all. See section 4.4 for more 
details.


Figure  1. Linking  FrameNet  frames  and  VerbNet
classes

4.2	Refining  the  mapping based  on verb 
alternations

In order to assign a VerbNet  class to a frame, we 
have to check that the verbs  belonging  to that 
frame  respect  the diathesis  alternation  criteria 
used to define the VerbNet class. Thus, the pairs
〈FrameNet frame, VerbNet class〉 formed in step 
(I) of the mapping algorithm have to undergo  a 
validation  step  that  verifies  the  similarity  be-
tween the enclosed FrameNet frame and VerbNet 
class.  This  validation  process  has  several  sub-
steps.
First, we make use of the property (3) of the
Levin classes and FrameNet frames presented in 
the previous section. According to this property,
all verbs pertaining to one frame or Levin class
have the same participant roles. Thus, a first test 
of compatibility between  a frame  and  a  Levin 
class is that they share the same participant roles. 
As FrameNet is annotated with frame-specific 
semantic roles we manually mapped these roles 
into the VerbNet  set of thematic roles. Given a 
frame,  we assigned  thematic  roles to all  frame 
elements that are associated with verbal predi- 
cates. For example the roles Speaker, Addressee, 
Message and Topic from the Telling frame were 
respectively  mapped  into Agent, Recipient, 
Theme and Topic.


    Second, we build a frequency distribution of 
VerbNet thematic roles on different syntactic 
position. Based on our observation and previous 
studies (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001), we assume 
that each  Levin  class  has  a  distinct  frequency 
distribution of roles on different grammatical 
slots. As we do not have matching grammatical 
function in FrameNet and VerbNet,  we approxi- 
mate that subjects  and  direct  objects  are  more 
likely to appear on positions adjacent to the 
predicate, while indirect objects appear on more 
distant positions. The same intuition is used suc- 
cessfully by G&J  in the design  of the Position 
feature.

    We will  acquire from the corpus, for each 
thematic  role θi, the frequencies  with which it 
appears on an adjacent  (ADJ)  or distant (DST) 
position in a given frame or VerbNet class (i.e.
#(θi, class, position)). Therefore, for each frame 
and class, we obtain two vectors with thematic 
role  frequencies  corresponding  respectively  to 
the adjacent and distant positions (see Figure 2). 
We compute a score for each pair 〈FrameNet 
frame, VerbNet class〉  using the normalized sca- 
lar product. We give a bigger  weight to the adja- 
cent dot product multiplying its score by 2/3 with 
respect to the distant  dot product that is  multi- 
plied by 1/3. We do this to minimize the impact 
that adjunct  roles  like  Temporal  and  Location 
(that appear  mostly on the distant positions) 
could have on the final outcome.

TR = {θ : θ    is the ith theta roel of theVerbNet theat role se}t


over  PropBank  as they are general  for all  verb 
classes. The only exception is ARGM-DIR 
that can correspond to Source, Goal or Path. 
We as- sign different roles to this adjunct 
based on the prepositions. We ignore some 
adjuncts like ARGM-ADV or ARGM-DIS 
because they can- not bear a thematic role.

4.3    Mapping Results

We found that only 133 VerbNet classes  have 
correspondents among FrameNet frames. Also, 
from the frames mapped with an automatic score 
smaller  than 0.5 points  almost  a  half did 
not match any of the existing  VerbNet 
classes3.  A summary of the results  is  depicted 
in Table  1. The first  column contains  the 
automatic  score provided by the mapping 
algorithm when com- paring frames  with 
Intersective  Levin  classes. The second  
column contains  the number of frames for 
each score interval. The third column contains 
the percentage of frames, per each score interval, 
that did not have  a corresponding VerbNet 
class and finally the forth column con- tains the 
accuracy of the mapping algorithm.

   The above frequency  vectors  are computed 
for FrameNet directly from the corpus of predi- 
cate-argument  structure  examples  associated 
with each frame. The examples associated with 
the VerbNet lexicon are extracted  from the 
PropBank corpus. In order to do this we apply a 
preprocessing step in which each label ARG0..N 
is replaced with its corresponding thematic role 
given  the Intersective  Levin  class  of the predi- 
cate. We assign the same roles to the adjuncts all


Levin  class.  By  investigating  such   cases  we 
noted  that the  mapping  algorithm  consistently
assigns  scores below 75% to cases  that match
problem 1 (two Levin classes inside one frame)
and below 50% to cases  that match problem  3 
(more than two Levin classes inside one frame). 
Thus, in order to increase  the accuracy  of 
our results   a   first   step   should   be to  
assign   an

Intersective  Levin  class  to each  of  the verbs 
pertaining to frames with score lower than 0.75. 
Nevertheless the current  results are encouraging 
as they show that the algorithm  is  achiving  its 
purpose   by  successfully   detecting   syntactic 
incoherencies that can be subsequently corrected 
manually. Also, in the next section we will show 
that our current  mapping  achieves very  good 
results, giving evidence for  the effectivenes of 
the Levin class feature.

5    Experiments

In the previous  section  we  have presented the 
algorithm  for annotating  the verb predicates of 
FrameNet with Intersective Levin classes. In or- 
der to show the effectiveness of this annotation 
and of the Intersective Levin class in general we 
have performed several experiments.
    First,  we trained  (1) an ILC multiclassifier 
from FrameNet, (2) an ILC multiclassifier from
PropBank  and (3) a  frame  multiclassifier  from
FrameNet.  We  compared the results obtained 
when trying to classify  the VerbNet  class  with 
the results obtained when classifying frame. We 
show that Intersective Levin classes are easier to 
detect than FrameNet frames.
   Our second  set  of experiments  regards  the 
automatic  labeling  of FrameNet  semantic  roles 
on FrameNet corpus when using as features: gold 
frame,  gold Intersective  Levin  class,  automati- 
cally detected frame and automatically detected 
Intersective Levin class. We show that in all 
situations in which the VerbNet  class feature is 
used, the accuracy loss, compared to the usage of 
the frame  feature,  is  negligible.  We thus show 
that the Intersective Levin class can successfully 
replace the frame feature for the task of semantic 
role labeling.
    Another  set of experiments regards the gen- 
eralization  property of  the  Intersective  Levin 
class. We show the impact of this feature when 
very few training data is available and its evolu- 
tion when adding more and more training exam- 
ples. We again perform the experiments for: gold 
frame,  gold Intersective  Levin  class,  automati- 
cally detected frame and automatically detected 
Intersective Levin class.
   Finally, we  simulate  the difficulty  of free 
text by annotating PropBank with FrameNet se-
mantic roles. We use PropBank  because it is dif-
ferent  from FrameNet  from a  domain  point of 
view. This characteristic makes PropBank  a dif-
ficult test bed for semantic  role  models trained
on FrameNet.
   

In the following section  we present the re- 
sults obtained for each of the experiments men- 
tioned above.

5.1    Experimental setup

The corpora available for the experiments were 
PropBank and FrameNet. PropBank contains 
about 54,900 sentences and gold parse trees. We 
used sections from 02 to 22 (52,172 sentences) to 
train the Intersective Levin class classifiers and 
section 23 (2,742 sentences) for testing purposes.
   For the experiments on FrameNet corpus we 
extracted 58,384 sentences from the 319 frames 
that contain at least one verb annotation. There 
are 128,339 argument instances of 454 semantic 
roles. Only verbs are selected to be predicates in 
our evaluations.  Moreover,   as there is no fixed 
split between training and testing, we randomly 
selected  20% of sentences  for testing and 80% 
for training. The sentences were processed using 
Charniak’s  parser (Charniak,  2000) to generate 
parse trees automatically.
For classification,  we  used the SVM-light-
TK software available at http://ai-nlp. 
info.uniroma2.it/moschitti which   en- 
codes  tree  kernels  in the SVM-light  software 
(Joachims, 1999). The classification performance 
was evaluated using the F1 measure for the sin- 
gle-argument classifiers and the accuracy for the 
multiclassifiers.

5.2	Automatic VerbNet  vs. automatic Fra- 
meNet frame detection

In these experiments we classify Intersective 
Levin classes (ILC) on PropBank (PB) and 
FrameNet (FN) and frame on FrameNet. For the 
training stage we use SVMs with Tree Kernels.
    The main idea of tree kernels is the modeling 
of a KT(T1,T2) function which computes the 
number of common substructures between two 
trees T1 and T2. Thus, we can train SVMs with 
structures drawn directly from the syntactic parse 
tree of the sentence.
   The kernel that we employed in our 
experiments is based on the SCF structure 
devised in (Moschitti, 2004). We  slightly 
modified  SCF by adding  the headwords of the 
arguments, useful for representing the selectional 
preferences.
   For frame detection on FrameNet, we trained 
our classifier  on 46,734 training  instances  and
tested on 11,650 testing instances, obtaining an
accuracy   of  91.11%. For  ILC  detection   the 
results  are  depicted  in Table   2. The  first  six
columns report  the F1  measure  of some  verb


class classifiers whereas the last  column shows 
the global multiclassifier accuracy.
We note that ILC detection is performed better 
than frame detection on both FrameNet  and 
PropBank. Also, the results obtained on ILC on
PropBank  are similar with the ones obtained on
ILC on FrameNet. This suggests that the training 
corpus does not have a major influence. Also, the
SCF-based tree kernel seems to be robust in what


concerns the quality of the parse trees.  The 
performance  decay is  very small  on FrameNet 
that uses  automatic  parse  trees  with respect to 
PropBank that contains  gold parse trees. These 
properties suggest that ILC are very suitable for 
free text.

5.3    Automatic  semantic   role   labeling   on
FrameNet

In the experiments involving semantic role 
labelling, we used a SVM  with a polynomial 
kernel. We adopted the standard features 
developed for semantic role detection by Gildea 
and Jurafsky (see Section 2). Also, we 
considered some of the features designed by 
(Pradhan et al., 2004): First and Last Word/POS 
in Constituent, Subcategorization, Head Word of 
Prepositional  Phrases  and the Syntactic  Frame 
feature  from (Xue and  Palmer,  2004). For the 
rest of the paper we will refer to these features as 
being literature features (LF). The results 
obtained when using the literature features alone 
or in conjunction  with the  gold frame  feature, 
gold ILC, automatically  detected  frame  feature


and automatically detected ILC are depicted in 
Table  3. The first  four columns report  the F1 
measure of some role classifiers whereas the last 
column shows  the global multiclassifier 
accuracy. The first row contains the number of 
training and testing instances and each of the 
other rows contains the performance obtained for 
different  feature  combinations.  The results  are 
reported for the labeling  task  as the  argument- 
boundary detection  task  is  not affected  by the 
frame-like features (G&J).
    We  note  that automatic  frame  results  are 
very similar to automatic ILC results suggesting
that ILC  feature  is  a very  good candidate  for 
replacing the frame feature. Also, both automatic
features are very  effective, decreasing the error 
rate of 20%.

5.4	Semantic role learning curve when us- 
ing Intersective Levin classes

The next set of experiments show the impact of 
the ILC feature on semantic role labelling when 
few training data is available (Figure 3). As can 
be noted, the automatic ILC features (i.e. derived


with classifers trained on FrameNet or PB) 
produce accuracy almost as good as the gold ILC 
one. Another  observation is that  the SRL 
classifiers are not saturated and more training 
examples would improve their accuracy.

5.5	Annotating  PropBank  with  FrameNet 
semantic roles

To show that our approach can be suitable  for 
semantic role free-text annotation, we have 
automatically classified PropBank sentences with 
the FrameNet semantic-role classifiers. In order 
to measure the quality of the annotation, we ran- 
domly selected 100 sentences and manually veri- 
fied  them. We  measured the performance  ob- 
tained with and without the automatic ILC fea- 
ture. The sentences contained 189 arguments 
from which 35 were  incorrect  when ILC  was 
used compared to 72 incorrect in the absence of 
this feature. This corresponds to an accuracy  of
81% with Intersective  Levin  class  versus  62%
without it.

6    Conclusions

In this paper we have shown that the Intersective 
Levin class feature can successfully replace the 
FrameNet frame feature. By doing that we could 
interconnect FrameNet to VerbNet  and Prop- 
Bank obtaining better verb coverage and a more 
robust semantic  parser.  Our good results  show 
that we  have  defined an  effective  framework 
which is a promising step toward  the design of 
free-text semantic parsers.
In the future, we intend to measure the effective- 
ness  of our system by testing  on larger,  more 
comprehensive  corpora  and without relying  on 
any manual annotation.
