Abstract

This paper presents a method of automat- 
ically constructing information extraction 
patterns on predicate-argument structures 
(PASs) obtained by full parsing from a 
smaller training corpus.   Because PASs 
represent generalized structures for syn- 
tactical variants, patterns on PASs are ex- 
pected to be more generalized than those 
on surface words.   In addition, patterns 
are divided into components to improve 
recall and we introduce a Support Vector 
Machine to learn a prediction model using 
pattern matching results. In this paper, we 
present experimental results and analyze 
them on how well protein-protein interac- 
tions were extracted from MEDLINE ab- 
stracts. The results demonstrated that our 
method improved accuracy compared to a 
machine learning approach using surface 
word/part-of-speech patterns.

1   Introduction

One primitive approach to Information Extrac- 
tion (IE) is to manually craft numerous extrac- 
tion patterns for particular applications and this 
is presently one of the main streams of biomedi- 
cal IE (Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Koike et al.,
2003).  Although such IE attempts have demon- 
strated near-practical performance, the same sets 
of patterns cannot be applied to different kinds of 
information.  A real-world task requires several 
kinds of IE, thus manually engineering extraction

patterns, which is tedious and time-consuming 
process, is not really practical.
  Techniques based on machine learning (Zhou et 
al., 2005; Hao et al., 2005; Bunescu and Mooney,
2006) are expected to alleviate this problem in 
manually crafted IE. However, in most cases, the 
cost of manually crafting patterns is simply trans- 
ferred to that for constructing a large amount of 
training data, which requires tedious amount of 
manual labor to annotate text.
  To systematically reduce the necessary amount 
of training data, we divided the task of construct- 
ing extraction patterns into a subtask that general 
natural language processing techniques can solve 
and a subtask that has speciﬁc properties accord- 
ing to the information to be extracted. The former 
subtask is of full parsing (i.e. recognizing syntactic 
structures of sentences), and the latter subtask is of 
constructing speciﬁc extraction patterns (i.e. ﬁnd- 
ing clue words to extract information) based on the 
obtained syntactic structures.
  We adopted full parsing from various levels 
of parsing, because we believe that it offers the 
best utility to generalize sentences into normal- 
ized syntactic relations. We also divided patterns 
into components to improve recall and we intro- 
duced machine learning with a Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) to learn a prediction model us- 
ing the matching results of extraction patterns. As 
an actual IE task, we extracted pairs of interacting 
protein names from biomedical text.

2   Full Parsing

2.1   Necessity for Full Parsing

A technique that many previous approaches have 
used is shallow parsing (Koike et al., 2003; Yao 
et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2005). Their assertion is

Distance −1 means protein word has been annotated as in- 
teracting with itself (e.g. “actin polymerization”). Distance 0 
means words of the interacting proteins are directly next to 
one another. Multi-word protein names are concatenated as 
long as they do not cross tags to annotate proteins.

that shallow parsers are more robust and would be 
sufﬁcient for IE. However, their claims that shal- 
low parsers are sufﬁcient, or that full parsers do 
not contribute to application tasks, have not been 
fully proved by experimental results.
  Zhou et al. (2005) argued that most informa- 
tion useful for IE derived from full parsing was 
shallow.  However, they only used dependency 
trees and paths on full parse trees in their experi- 
ment. Such structures did not include information 
of semantic subjects/objects, which full parsing 
can recognize.  Additionally, most relations they 
extracted from the ACE corpus (Linguistic Data 
Consortium, 2005) on broadcasts and newswires 
were within very short word-distance (70% where 
two entities are embedded in each other or sep- 
arated by at most one word), and therefore shal- 
low information was beneﬁcial. However, Table 1 
shows that the word distance is long between in- 
teracting protein names annotated on the AImed 
corpus (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004), and we have 
to treat long-distance relations for information like 
protein-protein interactions.
  Full parsing is more effective for acquiring gen- 
eralized data from long-length words than shallow 
parsing.  The sentences at left in Figure 1 exem- 
plify the advantages of full parsing.  The gerund 
“activating” in the last sentence takes a non-local 
semantic subject “ENTITY1”, and shallow parsing 
cannot recognize this relation because “ENTITY1” 
and “activating” are in different phrases. Full pars- 
ing, on the other hand, can identify both the sub- 
ject of the whole sentence and the semantic subject 
of “activating” have been shared.

2.2   Predicate-argument Structures

We applied Enju (Tsujii Laboratory, 2005a) as 
a full parser which outputs predicate-argument 
structures  (PASs).    PASs  are  well  normalized



forms  that  represent  syntactic  relations.    Enju 
is based on Head-driven Phrase Structure Gram- 
mar (Sag and Wasow, 1999), and it has been 
trained on the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et 
al., 1994) and a biomedical corpus, the GENIA 
Treebank (GTB) (Tsujii Laboratory, 2005b).  We 
used a part-of-speech (POS) tagger trained on the 
GENIA corpus (Tsujii Laboratory, 2005b) as a 
preprocessor for Enju. On predicate-argument re- 
lations, Enju achieved 88.0% precision and 87.2% 
recall on PTB, and 87.1% precision and 85.4% re- 
call on GTB.
  The illustration at right in Figure 1 is a PAS 
example, which represents the relation between 
“activate”, “ENTITY1” and “ENTITY2” of all sen- 
tences to the left.   The predicate and its argu- 
ments are words converted to their base forms, 
augmented by their POSs.   The arrows denote 
the connections from predicates to their arguments 
and the types of arguments are indicated as arrow 
labels, i.e., ARGn (n = 1, 2, . . .), MOD. For ex- 
ample, the semantic subject of a transitive verb is 
ARG1 and the semantic object is ARG2.
  What is important here is, thanks to the strong 
normalization of syntactic variations, that we can 
expect that the construction algorithm for extract- 
ing patterns that works on PASs will need a much 
smaller training corpus than those working on 
surface-word sequences. Furthermore, because of 
the reduced diversity of surface-word sequences at 
the PAS level, any IE system at this level should 
demonstrate improved recall.

3   Related Work

Sudo et al. (2003), Culotta and Sorensen (2004) 
and Bunescu and Mooney (2005) acquired sub- 
structures derived from dependency trees as ex- 
traction patterns for IE in general domains. Their 
approaches were similar to our approach using 
PASs derived from full parsing.  However, one 
problem  with  their  systems  is  that  they  could 
not treat non-local dependencies such as seman- 
tic subjects of gerund constructions (discussed in 
Section 2), and thus rules acquired from the con- 
structions were partial.
  Bunescu and Mooney (2006) also learned ex- 
traction patterns for protein-protein interactions 
by SVM with a generalized subsequence kernel. 
Their patterns are sequences of words, POSs, en- 
tity types, etc., and they heuristically restricted 
length and word positions of the patterns.   Al-

though they achieved 79.8% precision and 59.5%

terns they claimed to have been successfully con- 
structed went against linguistic or biomedical in- 
tuition.  (e.g. “ENTITY1 and interacts with EN- 
TITY2” should be replaced by a more general pat- 
tern because they aimed to reduce the number of 
patterns.)


4   Method

We automatically construct patterns to extract 
protein-protein interactions from an annotated 
training corpus. The corpus needs to be tagged to 
denote which protein words are interacting pairs.
  We follow ﬁve steps in constructing extraction 
patterns from the training corpus.  (1) Sentences 
in the training corpus are parsed into PASs and 
we extract raw patterns from the PASs.  (2) We 
divide the raw patterns to generate both combi- 
nation and fragmental patterns. Because obtained 
patterns include inappropriate ones (wrongly gen- 
erated or too general), (3) we apply both kinds of 
patterns to PASs of sentences in the training cor- 
pus, (4) calculate the scores for matching results 
of combination patterns, and (5) make a prediction 
model with SVM using these matching results and 
scores.
  We extract pairs of interacting proteins from a 
target text in the actual IE phase, in three steps. 
(1) Sentences in the target corpus are parsed into 
PASs. (2) We apply both kinds of extraction pat- 
terns to these PASs and (3) calculate scores for 
combination pattern matching. (4) We use the pre- 
diction model to predict interacting pairs.

4.1   Full Parsing and Extraction of 
Raw
Patterns

As the ﬁrst step in both the construction phase 
and application phase of extraction patterns, we 
parse sentences into PASs using Enju.1    We 
label all PASs of the protein names as protein 
PASs.
  After parsing, we extract the smallest set of 
PASs, which connect words that denote 
interact- ing proteins, and make it a raw pattern.  
We take the same method to extract and reﬁne 
raw patterns as Yakushiji et al. (2005). 
Connecting means we can trace predicate-
argument relations from one protein word to 
the other in an interacting pair. The procedure 
to obtain a raw pattern (p0 , . . . , pn) is as follows:
predicate(p): PASs that have p as their 
argument
argument(p): PASs that p has as its 
arguments

1. pi = p0 is the PAS of a word 
correspondent to one of interacting 
proteins, and we obtain candidates of the 
raw pattern as follows:

1-1. If pi is of the word of the other 
interact- ing protein, (p0, . . . , pi) is a 
candidate of the raw pattern.
1-2. If    not,     make    pattern    
candidates for each pi+1    ∈  
predicate(pi) ∪ argument(pi)   −  
{p0, . . . , pi }    by
returning to 1-1.

2. Select the pattern candidate of the 
smallest set as the raw pattern.

  1 Before parsing, we concatenate each multi-word 
protein name into the one word as long as the concatenation 
does not cross name boundaries.






3. Substitute variables (ENTITY1, ENTITY2) for 
the predicates of PASs correspondent to the 
interacting proteins.

we set it as p1  (in other words, tracing the arrow
(1)). Next, predicate(p1) includes the PAS of “in- 
teract” (tracing the arrow (2) back), so we set it


protein/ENnNtity

as p2.  We continue similarly until we reach the
PAS of “MHCII” (p6 ). The result of the extracted 
raw pattern is the set of p0 , . . . , p6 with substitut- 
ing variables ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 for “CD4” 
and “MHCII”.
  There are some cases where an extracted raw 
pattern  is  not  appropriate and  we  need  to  re- 
ﬁne it.   One case is when unnecessary coordi- 
nations/parentheses are included in the pattern, 
e.g. two interactions are described in a combined 
representation (“ENTITY1 binds this protein and 
ENTITY2”). Another is when two interacting pro- 
teins are connected directly by a conjunction or 
only one protein participates in an interaction. In 
such cases, we reﬁne patterns by unfolding of co- 
ordinations/parentheses and extension of patterns, 
respectively.  We have omitted detailed explana- 
tions because of space limitations. The details are 
described in the work of Yakushiji et al. (2005).

4.2   Division of Patterns
Division for generating combination patterns is 
based on observation of Yakushiji et al. (2005) that 
there are many cases where combinations of verbs 
and certain nouns form IE patterns.  In the work 
of Yakushiji et al. (2005), we divided only patterns 
that include only one verb. We have extended the 
division process to also treat nominal patterns or 
patterns that include more than one verb.
  Combination patterns are not appropriate for 
utilizing individual word information because they 
are always used in rather strictly combined ways. 
Therefore we have newly introduced fragmental 
patterns which consist of independent PASs from 
raw patterns, in order to use individual word infor- 
mation for higher recall.

4.2.1   Division for Generating Combination
Patterns
  Raw patterns are divided into some compo- 
nents and the components are combined to con-


Figure 3: Division of Raw Pattern into Combina-
tion Pattern Components (Entity-Main-Entity)


struct combination patterns according to types of 
the division. There are three types of division of 
raw patterns for generating combination patterns. 
These are:
(a) Two-entity Division
(a-1) Entity-Main-Entity Division
(a-2) Main-Entity-Entity Division
(b) Single-entity Division, and
(c) No Division (Naive Patterns).
Most  raw  patterns,  where  entities  are  at  both 
ends of the patterns, are divided into Entity-Main- 
Entity. Main-Entity-Entity are for the cases where 
there are PASs other than entities at the ends of 
the patterns (e.g. “interaction between ENTITY1 
and ENTITY2”).  Single-entity is a special Main- 
Entity-Entity for interactions with only one partic- 
ipant (e.g. “ENTITY1 dimerization”).
  There is an example of Entity-Main-Entity divi- 
sion in Figure 3. First, the main component from 
the raw pattern is the syntactic head PAS of the 
raw pattern.  If the raw pattern corresponds to a 
sentence, the syntactic head PAS is the PAS of the 
main verb. We underspecify the arguments of the 
main component, to enable them to unify with the 
PASs of any words with the same POSs. Next, if 
there are PASs of prepositions connecting to the 
main component, they become prep components. 
If there is no PAS of a preposition next to the main 
component on the connecting link from the main 
component to an entity, we make the pseudo PAS 
of a null preposition the prep component. The left 
prep component ($X) in Figure 3 is a pseudo PAS 
of a null preposition. We also underspecify the ar- 
guments of prep components. Finally, the remain- 
ing two parts, which are typically noun phrases, of 
the raw pattern become entity components. PASs


corresponding to the entities of the original pair 
are labeled as only uniﬁable with the entities of 
other pairs.

  Main-Entity-Entity division is similar, except 
we distinguish only one prep component as a 
double-prep component and the PAS of the coor- 
dinate conjunction between entities becomes the 
coord component.  Single-entity division is simi- 
lar to Main-Entity-Entity division and the differ- 
ence is that single-entity division produces no co- 
ord and one entity component. Naive patterns are 
patterns without division, where no division can be 
applied (e.g. “ENTITY1/NN in/IN complexes/NN 
with/IN ENTITY2/NN ”).

  All PASs on boundaries of components are la- 
beled to determine which PAS on a boundary of 
another component can be uniﬁed. Labels are rep- 
resented by subscriptions in Figure 3.  These re- 
strictions on component connection are used in the 
step of constructing combination patterns.

  Constructing combination patterns by combin- 
ing components is equal to reconstructing orig- 
inal raw patterns with the original combination 
of components, or constructing new raw patterns 
with new combinations of components. For exam- 
ple, an Entity-Main-Entity pattern is constructed 
by combination of any main, any two prep and any 
two entity components. Actually, this construction 
process by combination is executed in the pattern 
matching step.  That is, we do not off-line con- 
struct all possible combination patterns from the 
components and only construct the combination 
patterns that are able to match the target.


4.2.2   Division for Generating Fragmental
Patterns

  A raw pattern is splitted into individual PASs 
and each PAS becomes a fragmental pattern. We 
also prepare underspeciﬁed patterns where one or 
more of the arguments of the original are under- 
speciﬁed, i.e.,  are able to match any words of 
the same POSs and the same label of protein/not- 
protein.  We underspecify the PASs of entities in 
fragmental patterns to enable them to unify with


4.3   Pattern Matching

Matching of combination patterns is executed as 
a process to match and combine combination pat- 
tern components according to their division types 
(Entity-Main-Entity, Main-Entity-Entity, Single- 
entity and No Division). Fragmental matching is 
matching all fragmental patterns to PASs derived 
from sentences.

4.4   Scoring for Combination Matching

We next calculate the score of each combination 
matching to estimate the adequacy of the combina- 
tion of components. This is because new combina- 
tion of components may form inadequate patterns. 
(e.g. “ENTITY1 be ENTITY2” can be formed of 
components from “ENTITY1 be ENTITY2 recep- 
tor”.) Scores are derived from the results of com- 
bination matching to the source training corpus.
  We apply the combination patterns to the train- 
ing corpus, and count pairs of True Positives (TP) 
and False Positives (FP). The scores are calculated 
basically by the following formula:

Score = T P /(T P + F P ) + α × T P

 This formula is based on the precision of the pat- 
tern on the training corpus, i.e., an estimated pre- 
cision on a test corpus.  α works for smoothing, 
that is, to accept only patterns of large T P when 
F P = 0. α is set as 0.01 empirically. The formula 
is similar to the Apriori algorithm (Agrawal and 
Srikant, 1995) that learns association rules from a 
database. The ﬁrst term corresponds to the conﬁ- 
dence of the algorithm, and the second term corre- 
sponds to the support.
  For patterns where T P   = F P   = 0, which 
are not matched to PASs in the training corpus 
(i.e., newly produced by combinations of com- 
ponents), we estimates T P ′  and F P ′  by using 
the conﬁdence of the main and entity compo- 
nents. This is because main and entity components 
tend to contain pattern meanings, whereas prep, 
double-prep and coord components are rather 
functional.  The formulas to calculate the scores 
for all cases are:


any PASs with the same POSs and a protein la- 
bel, although in combination patterns we retain the 
PASs of entities as only uniﬁable with entities of


8T P /(T P + F P ) + α
> (T P + F P ̸= 0)
Score = <  P ′ /(T P ′ + F P ′ )



× T P


pairs. This is because fragmental patterns are de-
signed to be less strict than combination patterns.


> (T P = F P = 0, T P ′ + F P ′ ̸= 0)
:0   (T P = F P = T P ′ = F P ′ = 0)

only consists of the PAS of an entity, adds no infor-

this component a straight entity component and 
exclude its effect from the scores.

4.5   Construction of Prediction Model

We use an SVM to learn a prediction model to de- 
termine whether a new protein pair is interacting. 
We used SV M light (Joachims, 1999) with an rbf 
kernel, which is known as the best kernel for most 
tasks.  The prediction model is based on the fea- 
tures of Table 2.


protein-protein interactions, for the training/test
corpora. We used tags for the protein names given.
  We measured the accuracy of the IE task 
using the same criterion as Bunescu and 
Mooney (2006), who used an SVM to construct 
extraction patterns on word/POS/type 
sequences from the AImed cor- pus. That is, an 
extracted interaction from an ab- stract is 
correct if the proteins are tagged as inter- 
acting with each other somewhere in that 
abstract (document-level measure).
  Figure 4 plots our 10-fold cross validation 
and the results of Bunescu and Mooney 
(2006).  The line ALL represents results when 
we used all fea- tures for SVM learning.  The 
line SCORE repre- sents results when we 
extracted pairs with higher combination 
matching scores than various thresh- old 
values.  And the line ERK represents results 
by Bunescu and Mooney (2006).
  The line ALL obtained our best overall F- 
measure 57.3%, with 71.8% precision and 
48.4% recall.  Our method was signiﬁcantly 
better than Bunescu and Mooney (2006) for 
precision be-



tween 50% and 80%.  It also needs to be noted 
that SCORE, which did not use SVM learning 
and only used the combination patterns, achieved 
performance comparable to that by Bunescu and 
Mooney (2006) for the precision range from 50% 
to 80%. And for this range, introducing the frag- 
mental patterns with SVM learning raised the re- 
call.  This range of precision is practical for the 
IE task, because precision is more important than 
recall for signiﬁcant interactions that tend to be 
described in  many  abstracts (as  shown  by  the 
next experiment), and too-low recall accompa- 
nying too-high precision requires an excessively 
large source text.
  Figure 5 shows the advantage of introducing 
full parsing. “FGF-2” and “KGFR” is an interact- 
ing protein pair.  The pattern “ENTITY1 interact 
with ENTITY2” based on PASs successfully ex- 
tracts this pair.  However, it is difﬁcult to extract 
this pair with patterns based on surface words, be- 
cause there are 5 words between “FGF-2” and “in- 
teract”.

5.2   Experimental Results on Abstracts of
MEDLINE

We also conducted an experiment to extract in- 
teracting protein pairs from a large amount of 
biomedical text, i.e. about 14 million titles and
8 million abstracts in MEDLINE. We constructed 
combination patterns from all 225 abstracts of the 
AImed corpus, and calculated a threshold value 
of combination scores that produced about 70% 
precision and 30% recall on the training corpus. 
We extracted protein pairs with higher combi- 
nation scores than the threshold value.  We ex- 
cluded single-protein interactions to reduce time 
consumption and we used a protein name recog- 
nizer in this experiment2.
  We compared the extracted pairs with a man- 
ually curated database, Reactome (Joshi-Tope et 
al., 2005), which published 16,564 human pro- 
tein  interaction  pairs  as  pairs  of  Entrez  Gene 
IDs (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2006). 
We converted our extracted protein pairs into pairs 
of Entrez Gene IDs by the protein name recog- 
nizer.3  Because there may be pairs missed by Re-

  2 Because protein names were recognized after the pars- 
ing, multi-word protein names were not concatenated.
    3 Although the same protein names are used for humans 
and other species, these are considered to be human proteins 
without checking the context.  This is a fair assumption be- 
cause Reactome itself infers human interaction events from 
experiments on model organisms such as mice.

More than one cause can occur in one error, thus the sum of 
all causes is larger than the total number of False Negatives.

Table 3: Causes of Error for FNs


actome or pairs that our processed text did not in- 
clude, we excluded extracted pairs of IDs that are 
not included in Reactome and excluded Reactome 
pairs of IDs that do not co-occur in the sentences 
of our processed text.
  After this postprocessing, we found that we had 
extracted 7775 human protein pairs. Of them, 155 
pairs were also included in Reactome ([a] pseudo 
TPs) and 7620 pairs were not included in Reac- 
tome ([b] pseudo FPs).  947 pairs of Reactome 
were not extracted by our system ([c] pseudo False 
Negatives (FNs)). However, these results included 
pairs that Reactome missed or those that only co- 
occurred and were not interacting pairs in the text. 
There may also have been errors with ID assign- 
ment.
  To determine such cases, a biologist investi- 
gated 100 pairs randomly selected from pairs of 
pseudo TPs, FPs and FNs retaining their ratio of 
numbers. She also checked correctness of the as- 
signed IDs.  2 pairs were selected from pseudo 
TPs, 88 pairs were from pseudo FPs and 10 pairs 
were from pseudo FNs.  The biologist found that
57 pairs were actual TPs (2 pairs of pseudo TPs 
and 55 pairs of pseudo FPs) and 32 pairs were ac- 
tual FPs of the pseudo FPs.  Thus, the precision 
was 64.0% in this sample set. Furthermore, even 
if we assume that all pseudo FNs are actual FNs, 
the recall can be estimated by actual TPs / (actual
TPs + pseudo FNs) × 100 = 83.8%.
These results mean that the recall of an IE sys-
tem for interacting proteins is improved for a large 
amount of text even if it is low for a small corpus. 
Thus, this justiﬁes our assertion that a high degree 
of precision in the low-recall range is important.

ually checked each occurring pair of interacting 
proteins.  The biggest problems were parsing er- 
ror/failure, lack of necessary patterns and learning 
of inappropriate patterns.

5.3.1   Parsing Error

  As listed in Table 3, 14 (40%) of the 35 pars- 
ing errors/failures were related to coordinations. 
Many of these were caused by differences in the 
characteristics of the PTB/GTB, the training cor- 
pora for Enju, and the AImed Corpus.  For ex- 
ample, Enju failed to obtain the correct structure 
for “the ENTITY1 / ENTITY1 complex” because 
words in the PTB/GTB are not segmented with 
“/” and Enju could not be trained on such a case. 
One method to solve this problem is to avoid seg- 
menting words with “/” and introducing extraction 
patterns based on surface characters, such as “EN- 
TITY1/ENTITY2 complex”.
  Parsing errors are intrinsic problems to IE meth- 
ods using parsing. However, from Table 3, we can 
conclude that the key to gaining better accuracy 
is reﬁning of the method with which the PAS pat- 
terns are constructed (there were 46 related FNs) 
rather than improving parsing (there were 35 FNs).

5.3.2   Lack of Necessary Patterns and
Learning of Inappropriate Patterns

  There are two different reasons causing the 
problems with the lack of necessary patterns and 
the learning of inappropriate patterns:  (1) the 
training corpus was not sufﬁciently large to sat- 
urate IE accuracy and (2) our method of pattern 
construction was too limited.

Effect of Training Corpus Size   To investigate 
whether the training corpus was large enough to 
maximize IE accuracy, we conducted experiments 
on training corpora of various sizes. Figure 6 plots

is not large enough.  Thus increasing corpus size 
will further improve IE accuracy.

Limitation of the Present Pattern Construc- 
tion   The limitations with our pattern construc- 
tion  method  are  revealed  by  the  fact  that  we 
could not achieve a high precision like Bunescu 
and Mooney (2006) within the high-recall range. 
Compared to theirs, one of our problems is that our 
method could not handle attributives. One exam- 
ple is “binding property of ENTITY1 to ENTITY2”. 
We could not obtain “binding” because the small- 
est set of PASs connecting “ENTITY1” and “EN- 
TITY2” includes only the PASs of “property”, “of” 
and “to”. To handle these attributives, we need dis- 
tinguish necessary attributives from those that are 
general4 by semantic analysis or bootstrapping.
  Another approach to improve our method is to 
include local information in sentences, such as 
surface words between protein names.  Zhao and 
Grishman (2005) reported that adding local infor- 
mation to deep syntactic information improved IE 
results.  This approach is also applicable to IE in
other domains, where related entities are in a short

distance like the work of Zhou et al. (2005).

6   Conclusion

We proposed the use of PASs to construct pat- 
terns as extraction rules, utilizing their ability to 
abstract syntactical variants with the same rela- 
tion. In addition, we divided the patterns for gen- 
eralization, and used matching results for SVM 
learning. In experiments on extracting of protein- 
protein interactions, we obtained 71.8% precision 
and 48.4% recall on a small corpus and 64.0% pre- 
cision and 83.8% recall estimated on a large text, 
which demonstrated the obvious advantages of our 
method.
