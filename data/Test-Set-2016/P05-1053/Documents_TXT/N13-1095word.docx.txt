Abstract


Distant supervision, heuristically labeling a 
corpus using a knowledge base, has emerged 
as a popular choice for training relation ex- 
tractors.  In this paper, we show that a sig- 
nificant number of “negative“ examples gen- 
erated by the labeling process are false neg- 
atives because the knowledge base is incom- 
plete.  Therefore the heuristic for generating 
negative examples has a serious flaw. Building 
on a state-of-the-art distantly-supervised ex- 
traction algorithm, we proposed an algorithm 
that learns from only positive and unlabeled 
labels at the pair-of-entity level. Experimental 
results demonstrate its advantage over existing 
algorithms.


1   Introduction

Relation  Extraction  is   a   well-studied  problem
(Miller et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2005; Kambhatla,
2004; Min et al., 2012a).  Recently, Distant Super- 
vision (DS) (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Mintz et 
al., 2009) has emerged to be a popular choice for 
training relation extractors without using manually 
labeled data. It automatically generates training ex- 
amples by labeling relation mentions1 in the source 
corpus according to whether the argument pair is 
listed in the target relational tables in a knowledge 
base (KB). This method significantly reduces human 
efforts for relation extraction.
  The labeling heuristic has a serious flaw. Knowl- 
edge bases are usually highly incomplete. For exam-

ple, 93.8% of persons from Freebase2 have no place 
of birth, and 78.5% have no nationality (section 3). 
Previous work typically assumes that if the argument 
entity pair is not listed in the KB as having a re- 
lation, all the corresponding relation mentions are 
considered negative examples.3 This crude assump- 
tion labeled many entity pairs as negative when in 
fact some of their mentions express a relation. The 
number of such false negative matches even exceeds 
the number of positive pairs, by 3 to 10 times, lead- 
ing to a significant problem for training.  Previous 
approaches (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al.,
2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012) bypassed this problem 
by heavily under-sampling the “negative“ class.
  We instead deal with a learning scenario where we 
only have entity-pair level labels that are either posi- 
tive or unlabeled. We proposed an extension to Sur- 
deanu et al. (2012) that can train on this dataset. Our 
contribution also includes an analysis on the incom- 
pleteness of Freebase and the false negative match 
rate in two datasets of labeled examples generated 
by DS. Experimental results on a realistic and chal- 
lenging dataset demonstrate the advantage of the al- 
gorithm over existing solutions.

2   Related Work

Distant supervision was first proposed by Craven 
and  Kumlien  (1999)  in  the  biomedical  domain.

  2 Freebase is a large collaboratively-edited KB. It is available 
at http://www.freebase.com.
3 There are variants of labeling heuristics. For example, Sur-
deanu et al. (2011) and Sun et al. (2011) use a pair < e, v > 
as a negative example, when it is not listed in Freebase, but e is 
listed with a different v′ . These assumptions are also problem- 
atic in cases where the relation is not functional.

Since then, it has gain popularity (Mintz et al., 2009; 
Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Wu and Weld, 2007; 
Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Sur- 
deanu et al., 2012; Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011). 
To tolerate noisy labels in positive examples, Riedel 
et al. (2010) use Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), 
which assumes only at-least-one of the relation men- 
tions in each “bag“ of mentions sharing a pair of ar- 
gument entities which bears a relation, indeed ex- 
presses the target relation.   MultiR (Hoffmann et 
al., 2011) and Multi-Instance Multi-Label (MIML) 
learning (Surdeanu et al., 2012) further improve it 
to support multiple relations expressed by different 
sentences in a bag.  Takamatsu et al. (2012) mod- 
els the probabilities of a pattern showing relations, 
estimated from the heuristically labeled dataset. 
Their algorithm removes mentions that match low- 
probability patterns.  Sun et al. (2011) and Min et 
al. (2012b) also estimate the probablities of patterns 
showing relations, but instead use them to relabel ex- 
amples to their most likely classes. Their approach 
can correct highly-confident false negative matches.

3   Problem Definition
Distant Supervision: Given a KB D (a collection


nor stay current. We took frequent relations, which 
involve an entity of type PERSON, from Freebase 
for analysis. We define the incompleteness ∂(r) of a 
relation r as follows:
∂(r) = |{e}|−|{e|∃e′ ,s.t.r(e,e′ )ǫD}|
|{e}|
  ∂(r) is the percentage of all persons {e} that do 
not have an attribute e′ (with which r(e, e′) holds).
Table 1 shows that 93.8% of persons have no place 
of birth, and 78.5% of them have no nationality. 
These are must-have attributes for a person.  This 
shows that Freebase is highly incomplete.
Freebase relation types 	Incompleteness
/people/person/education	0.792
/people/person/employment history 	0.923
/people/person/nationality*	0.785
/people/person/parents* 	0.988
/people/person/place  of birth* 	0.938
/people/person/places  lived* 	0.966
Table 1:  The incompleteness of Freebase (* are must- 
have attributes for a person).
  We further investigate the rate of false negative 
matches,  as the percentage of entity-pairs that are 
not listed in Freebase but one of its mentions gen- 
erated by DS does express a relation in the tar- 
get set of types.   We randomly picked 200 unla-
5


of relational tables r(e1, e2), in which rǫR (R is the


beled bags


from each of the two datasets (Riedel


set of relation labels), and < e1, e2  > is a pair of 
entities that is known to have relation r) and a cor- 
pus C , the key idea of distant supervision is that we
align D to C , label each bag4 of relation mentions
that share argument pair < e1, e2  > with r, other-
wise OTHER. This generates a dataset that has labels 
on entity-pair (bag) level. Then a relation extractor 
is trained with single-instance learning (by assum- 
ing all mentions have the same label as the bag), or 
Multiple-Instance Learning (by assuming at-least- 
one of the mentions expresses the bag-level label), 
or Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning (further as- 
suming a bag can have multiple labels) algorithms. 
All of these works treat the OTHER class as exam- 
ples that are labeled as negative.
  The incomplete KB problem: KBs are usually 
incomplete because they are manually constructed, 
and it is not possible to cover all human knowledge


et al., 2010; Surdeanu et al., 2012) generated by DS,
and we manually annotate all relation mentions in 
these bags.  The result is shown in Table 2, along 
with a few examples that indicate a relation holds in 
the set of false negative matches (bag-level).  Both 
datasets have around 10% false negative matches in 
the unlabeled set of bags.  Taking into considera- 
tion that the number of positive bags and unlabeled 
bags are highly imbalanced (1:134 and 1:37 in the 
Riedel and KBP dataset respectively, before under- 
sampling the unlabeled class), the number of false 
negative matches are 11 and 4 times the number 
of positive bags in Reidel and KBP dataset, respec- 
tively.  Such a large ratio shows false negatives do 
have a significant impact on the learning process.

4   A semi-supervised MIML algorithm

Our goal is to model the bag-level label noise, 
caused by the incomplete KB problem, in addition


4 A bag is defined as a set of relation mentions sharing the	 	


same entity pair as relation arguments. We will use the terms
bag and entity pair interchangeably in this paper.
  

5 85% and 95.7% of the bags in the Riedel and KBP datasets 
have only one relation mention.

to modeling the instance-level noise using a 3-layer 
MIL or MIML model (e.g., Surdeanu et al. (2012)). 
We propose a 4-layer model as shown in Figure 1.
  The input to the model is a list of n bags with a 
vector of binary labels, either Positive (P), or Un- 
labled (U) for each relation r.  Our model can be


• ℓr ǫ{P, N }: 	a  hidden  variable  that  denotes
whether r holds for the ith bag.
• θ is an observed constant controlling the total
number of bags whose latent label is positive.
We define the following conditional probabilities:

models the true bag-level labels, to bridge the ob- 
served bag labels y and the MIML layers. We con- 
sider this as our main contribution to the model. Our 
hierarchical model is shown in Figure 1.

 
Figure 1: Plate diagram of our model.
  Let i, j be the index in the bag and mention level, 
respectively. Following Surdeanu et al. (2012), we
model mention-level extraction p(zr |xij ; wz ) and
multi-instance multi-label aggregation p(ℓr |zi; wr )
in the bottom 3 layers. We define:


• p(θ|ℓ)	∼	N ( 	i=1	rǫR	i	,  1 )  where
n 	k
δ(x, y) = 1 if x = y, 0 otherwise. k is a large
number.  θ is the fraction of the bags that are 
positive.  It is an observed parameter that de- 
pends on both the source corpus and the KB 
used.
  Similar to Surdeanu et al. (2012), we also define 
the following parameters and conditional probabili- 
ties (details are in Surdeanu et al. (2012)):
• zij ǫR ∪ {OT H ER}: a latent variable that de-
notes the relation type of the jth mention in the
ith bag.
• xij  is the feature representation of the jth rela-
tion mention in the ith bag. We use the set of
features in Surdeanu et al. (2012).
• wz is the weight vector for the multi-class rela-
tion mention-level classifier.
• wℓ is the weight vector for the rth binary top-

resent w1, w2, ...w|R|.

dataset, the training bags are generated by mapping 
Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org) infoboxes (after 
merging similar types following the KBP 2011 task 
definition) into a large unlabeled corpus (consisting 
of 1.5M documents from the KBP source corpus and 
a complete snapshot of Wikipedia). The KBP shared 
task provided 200 query named entities with their as- 
sociated slot values (in total several thousand pairs). 
We use 40 queries as development dataset (dev), and 
the rest (160 queries) as evaluation dataset. We set 
θ = 0.25 by tuning on the dev set and use it in the 
experiments. For a fair comparison, we follow Sur- 
deanu et al. (2012) and begin by downsampling the 
“negative“ class to 5%.  We also set T=8 and use 
the following noisy-or (for ith bag) of mention-level 
probability to rank predicted types (r) of pairs and 
plot the precision-recall curves for all experiments.
P robi(r) = 1 − n (1 − p(zij  = r|xij ; wz ))

  Evaluation: We compare our algorithm (MIML- 
semi)  to three algorithms:  1) MIML (Surdeanu et 
al., 2012), the Multiple-Instance Multiple Label al- 
gorithm which labels the bags directly with the KB 
(y = ℓ). 2) MultiR (denoted as Hoffmann) (Hoff- 
mann et al., 2011), a Multiple-Instance algorithm 
that supports overlapping relations. It also imposes 
y = ℓ. 3) Mintz++ (Surdeanu et al., 2012), a vari- 
ant of the single-instance learning algorithm (section
3).  The first two are stat-of-the-art Multi-Instance 
Multi-Label algorithms. Mintz++ is a strong base- 
line (Surdeanu et al., 2012) and an improved ver- 
sion of Mintz et al. (2009).   Figure 2 shows that 
our algorithm consistently outperforms all three al-


gorithms at almost all recall levels (with the excep- 
tion of a very small region in the PR-curve).  This 
demonstrates that by treating unla-beled data set dif- 
ferently and leveraging the missing positive bags, 
MIML-semi is able to learn a more accurate model 
for extraction. Although the proposed solution is a 
specific algorithm, we believe the idea of treating 
unlabeled data differently can be incorporated into 
any of these algorithms that only use unlabeled data 
as negative examples.

6   Conclusion

We show that the distant-supervision labeling pro- 
cess generates a significant number of false nega- 
tives because the knowledge base is incomplete. We 
proposed an algorithm that learns from only positive 
and unlabeled bags.  Experimental results demon- 
strate its advantage over existing algorithms.
