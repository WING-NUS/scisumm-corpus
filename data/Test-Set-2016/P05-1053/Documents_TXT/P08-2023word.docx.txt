Abstract

Relation extraction is the task of finding 
semantic relations between two entities from 
text.   In   this   paper,   we   propose   a   novel 
feature-based Chinese relation extraction 
approach that explicitly defines and explores 
nine positional structures between two entities. 
We also suggest some correction and inference 
mechanisms  based  on  relation  hierarchy  and 
co-reference information etc. The approach is 
effective  when  evaluated  on  the  ACE  2005
Chinese data set.


1     Introduction

Relation extraction is promoted by the ACE program. 
It is the task of finding predefined semantic relations 
between two entities from text. For example, the 
sentence “Bill Gates is the chairman and chief 
software architect of Microsoft Corporation” conveys 
the ACE-style relation “ORG-AFFILIATION” 
between the two entities “Bill Gates (PER)” and 
“Microsoft Corporation (ORG)”.
  The task of relation extraction has been extensively 
studied in English over the past years. It is typically 
cast as a classification problem. Existing approaches 
include feature-based and kernel-based classification. 
Feature-based approaches transform the  context of 
two entities into a liner vector of carefully selected 
linguistic features, varying from entity semantic 
information to lexical and syntactic features of the
context. Kernel-based approaches, on the other hand, 
explore structured representation such as parse tree 
and dependency tree and directly compute the 
similarity between trees. Comparably, feature-based 
approaches are easier to implement and achieve much 
success.
In	contrast	to	the	significant	achievements
concerning English and other Western languages, 
research progress in Chinese relation extraction is 
quite limited. This may be attributed to the different 
characteristic of Chinese language, e.g. no word 
boundaries and lack of morphologic variations, etc. In


this paper, we propose a character-based Chinese 
entity relation extraction approach that complements 
entity context (both internal and external) character 
N-grams with four word lists extracted from a 
published Chinese dictionary. In addition to entity 
semantic information, we define and examine nine 
positional structures between two entities. To cope 
with the data sparseness problem, we also suggest 
some correction and inference mechanisms according 
to the given ACE relation hierarchy and co-reference 
information. Experiments on the ACE 2005 data set 
show that the positional structure feature can provide 
stronger support for Chinese relation extraction. 
Meanwhile, it can be captured with less effort than 
applying deep natural language processing. But 
unfortunately, entity co-reference does not help as 
much as we have expected. The lack of necessary 
co-referenced mentions might be the main reason.

2      Related Work

Many approaches have been proposed in the literature 
of relation extraction. Among them, feature-based and 
kernel-based approaches are most popular.
  Kernel-based approaches exploit the structure of 
the tree that connects two entities. Zelenko et al (2003) 
proposed a kernel over two parse trees, which 
recursively matched nodes from roots to leaves in a 
top-down manner. Culotta and Sorensen (2004) 
extended this work to estimate similarity between 
augmented dependency trees. The above two work 
was further advanced by Bunescu and Mooney (2005) 
who argued that the information to extract a relation
between two entities can be typically captured by the 
shortest path between them in the dependency graph. 
Later, Zhang et al (2006) developed a composite 
kernel that combined parse tree kernel with entity 
kernel and Zhou et al (2007) experimented with a 
context-sensitive kernel by automatically determining 
context-sensitive tree spans.
In the feature-based framework, Kambhatla (2004)
employed ME models to combine diverse lexical, 
syntactic and semantic features derived from word, 
entity type, mention level, overlap, dependency and 
parse tree. Based  on  his work,  Zhou  et  al  (2005)

further incorporated the base phrase chunking 
information and semi-automatically collected country 
name list and personal relative trigger word list. Jiang 
and Zhai (2007) then systematically explored a large 
space of features and evaluated the effectiveness of 
different feature subspaces corresponding to sequence, 
syntactic parse tree and dependency parse tree. Their 
experiments showed that using only the basic unit 
features within each feature subspace can already 
achieve state-of-art performance, while over-inclusion 
of complex features might hurt the performance.
  Previous approaches mainly focused on  English 
relations. Most of them were evaluated on the ACE
2004 data set (or a sub set of it) which defined 7 
relation types and 23 subtypes. Although Chinese 
processing is of the same importance as English and 
other Western language processing, unfortunately few 
work has been published on Chinese relation 
extraction. Che et al (2005) defined an improved edit 
distance kernel over the original Chinese string 
representation  around  particular  entities.  The  only
relation they studied is PERSON-AFFLIATION. The 
insufficient study in Chinese relation extraction drives 
us to investigate how to find an approach that is 
particularly appropriate for Chinese.

3     A Chinese Relation Extraction Model

Due to the aforementioned reasons, entity relation 
extraction in Chinese is more challenging than in 
English. The system segmented words are already not 
error free, saying nothing of the quality of the 
generated parse trees. All these errors will 
undoubtedly propagate to the subsequent processing, 
such as relation extraction. It is therefore reasonable to


characters inside the heads of two entities. 
External context involves the characters around two 
entities within a given window size (it is set to 4 in 
this study). All the internal and external context 
characters are transformed to Uni-grams and Bi-
grams.
z  Word List 
Features
  Although Uni-grams and Bi-grams should be 
able to  cover  most  of  Chinese  words  given  
sufficient
training data, many discriminative words might not 
be discovered by classifiers due to the severe 
sparseness problem of Bi-grams. We complement 
character- based context features with four word 
lists which are extracted from a published Chinese 
dictionary. The word lists include 165 prepositions, 
105 orientations,
20 auxiliaries and 25 
conjunctions.

3.2 Correction with 
Relation/Argument
Constraints and Type/Subtype Consistency 
Check

An identified relation is said to be correct only 
when its type/subtype (R) is correct and at the same 
time its two arguments (ARG-1 and ARG-2) must 
be of the correct entity types/subtypes and of the 
correct order. One way to improve the previous 
feature-based classification approach is to make use 
of the prior knowledge of the task to find and 
rectify the incorrect results. Table 1 illustrates the 
examples of possible relations between PER and 
ORG. We regard possible relations between two 
particular types of entity arguments as constraints. 
Some relations are symmetrical for two arguments, 
such as PER_ SOCIAL.FAMILY, but others not, 
such as ORG_AFF. EMPLOYMENT. Argument 
orders are important for asymmetrical relations.
PER	ORG


conclude  that   kernel-based  especially  tree-kernel
approaches are not suitable for Chinese, at least at 
current stage. In this paper, we study a feature-based 
approach   that   basically   integrates   entity   related



PER

ORG
  

PER_SOCIAL.BUS, PER_SOCIAL.FAMILY, …


ORG_AFF.EMPLOYMENT, ORG_AFF.OWNERSHIP, …
PART_WHOLE.SUBSIDIARY, ORG_AFF.INVESTOR/SHARE, …


information with context information.

3.1 Classification Features

The classification is based on the following four types 
of features.
z  Entity Positional Structure Features
  We define and examine nine finer positional 
structures between two entities (see Appendix). They 
can be merged into three coarser structures.
z  Entity Features
Entity types and subtypes are concerned.
z  Entity Context Features
  These are character-based features. We consider 
both internal and external context. Internal context 
includes the characters inside two  entities and the


Table 1 Possible Relations between ARG-1 and 
ARG-2
  Since our classifiers are trained on relations 
instead of arguments, we simply select the first (as 
in adjacent and separate structures) and outer (as in 
nested structures) as the first argument. This setting 
works at most of cases, but still fails sometimes. 
The correction works in this way. Given two 
entities, if the identified type/subtype is an 
impossible one, it is revised to NONE (it means no 
relation at all). If the identified type/subtype is 
possible, but the order of arguments does not 
consist with the given relation definition, the order 
of arguments is adjusted.
  Another source of incorrect results is the 
inconsistency   between   the   identified   types   
and
subtypes, since they are typically classified 
separately.


This type of errors can be checked against the 
provided hierarchy of relations, such as the subtypes 
OWNERSHIP and EMPLOYMENT must belong to 
the ORG_AFF type. There are existing strategies to 
deal with this problem, such as strictly bottom-up (i.e. 
use the identified subtype to choose the type it belongs 
to), guiding top-down (i.e. to classify types first and 
then subtypes under a certain type). However, these 
two strategies lack of interaction between the two 
classification levels. To insure consistency in an 
interactive manner, we rank the first n numbers of the 
most likely classified types and then check them 
against the classified subtype one by one until the 
subtype conforms to a type. The matched type is 
selected as the result. If the last type still fails, both 
type and subtype are revised to NONE. We call this 
strategy type selection. Alternatively, we can choose 
the most likely classified subtypes, and check them 
with the classified type (i.e. subtype selection 
strategy). Currently, n is 2.

3.2 Inference with Co-reference Information and
Linguistic Patterns

Each entity can be mentioned in different places in 
text. Two mentions are said to be co-referenced to one 
entity if they refers to the same entity in the world 
though they may have different surface expressions. 
For example, both “he” and “Gates” may refer to “Bill 
Gates of Microsoft”. If a relation “ORG- 
AFFILIATION” is held between “Bill Gates” and 
“Microsoft”, it must be also held between “he” and 
“Microsoft”. Formally, given two entities E1={EM11, 
EM12, …, EM1n} and E2={EM21, EM22, …, EM2m} (Ei 
is an entity, EMij  is a mention of Ei), it is true that
R(EM11, EM21)⇒ R(EM1l, EM2k). This nature allows
us to infer more relations which may not be identified
by classifiers.
  Our previous experiments show that the 
performance of the nested and the adjacent relations is 
much better than the performance of other structured 
relations which suffer from unbearable low recall due 
to insufficient training data. Intuitively we can follow
the path of  “Nested ⇒  Adjacent ⇒  Separated ⇒
Others” (Nested, Adjacent and Separated structures
are majority in the corpus) to perform the inference. 
But soon we have an interesting finding. If two related 
entities are nested, almost all the mentions of them are
nested. So basically inference works on “Adjacent ⇒
Separated’’.
  When considering the co-reference information, we 
may find another type of inconsistency, i.e. the one
raised from co-referenced entity mentions. It is 
possible that R(EM11, EM21) ≠ R(EM12, EM22) when R


is identified based on the context of EM. Co-
reference not only helps for inference but also 
provides the second chance to check the 
consistency among entity mention pairs so that we 
can revise accordingly. As the classification results 
of SVM can be transformed to probabilities with 
a sigmoid function, the relations of lower 
probability mention pairs are revised according to 
the relation of highest probability mention pairs.
  The above inference strategy is called 
coreference- based inference. Besides, we find 
that pattern-based inference is also necessary. The 
relations of adjacent structure can infer the 
relations of separated structure if there are certain 
linguistic indicators in the local context. For 
example, given a local context “EM1 and EM2 
located EM3”, if the relation of EM2 and EM3 has 
been identified, EM1  and EM3  will take the 
relation type/subtype that EM2 and EM3 holds. 
Currently, the only indicators under consideration 
are “and” and “or”. However, more patterns can be 
included in the future.

4     Experimental 
Results

The experiments are  conducted on  the  ACE  
2005
Chinese RDC training data (with true entities) 
where 6 types and 18 subtypes of relations are 
annotated. We use 75% of it to train SVM 
classifiers and the remaining to evaluate results.
  The aim of the first set of experiments is to 
examine the role of structure features. In these 
experiments, a “NONE” class is added to indicate a 
null type/subtype. With entity features and entity 
context features and word list features, we 
consider three different classification contexts: (1), 
only three coarser structures 1 , i.e. nested, 
adjacent and separated, are
used as feature, and a classifier is trained for 
each
relation type and subtype; (2) similar to (1) but all 
nine structures are concerned; and (3) similar to (2) 
but the training data is divided into 9 parts 
according to structure, i.e. type and subtype 
classifiers are trained on the data with the same 
structures. The results presented in Table 2 show 
that 9-structure is much more discriminative than 
3-structure. Also, the performance   can   be   
improved   significantly   by dividing training data 
based on nine structures.

Table 3 Imbalance Training Class Problem
  In the experiments, we find that the training class 
imbalance problem is quite serious, especially for the 
separated   structure   (see   Table   3   above   where


internal context; positional structure provides stronger 
support than other individual recognized features such 
as entity type and context; but word list feature can not 
further boost the performance.

solution to alleviate this problem is to detect whether
the given two entities have some relation first and if 
they do then to classify the relation types and subtypes 
instead of combining detection and classification in 
one process. The second set of experiment is to 
examine the difference between these two 
implementations. Against our expectation, the 
sequence implementation does better than the 
combination implementation, but not significantly, as 
sh  own in Table 4 below.

Table 4 Evaluation of Two Detection and Classification Modes
  Based on the sequence implementation, we set up 
the third set of experiments to examine the correction 
and inference mechanisms. The results are illustrated 
in Table 5. The correction with constraints and 
consistency check is clearly contributing. It improves 
F-measure 7.40% and 6.47% in type and subtype 
classification respectively. We further compare four 
possible consistency check strategies in Table 6 and 
find that the strategies using subtypes to determine or 
select types perform better than top down strategies. 
This can be attributed to the fact that correction with 
relation/argument constraints in subtype is tighter than 
the ones in type.

Conclusion

In this paper, we study feature-based Chinese 
relation extraction. The proposed approach is 
effective on the ACE 2005 data set. Unfortunately, 
there is no result reported on the same data so that we 
can compare.

  Finally, we provide our findings from the fourth set 
of experiments which looks at the detailed 
contributions from four feature types. Entity type 
features themselves do not work. We incrementally 
add the structures, the external contexts and internal 
contexts, Uni-grams and Bi-grams, and at last the 
word lists on them. The observations are: Uni-grams 
provide    more    discriminative    information    than 
Bi-grams; external context seems more useful than
