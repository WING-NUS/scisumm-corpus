Abstract

This paper  proposes  a  novel application of 
a supervised   topic model to do entity rela- 
tion detection (ERD). We adapt Maximum En- 
tropy Discriminant Latent Dirichlet Alloca- 
tion (MEDLDA) with mixed membership for 
relation detection. The ERD task is refor- 
mulated to fit into the topic modeling frame- 
work. Our approach combines the benefits of 
both, maximum-likelihood  estimation (MLE) 
and max-margin  estimation (MME), and the 
mixed membership  formulation enables  the 
system to incorporate heterogeneous features. 
We incorporate different features into the sys- 
tem and perform experiments  on the ACE
2005 corpus. Our approach achieves better 
overall performance for precision, recall and 
Fmeasure metrics as compared to SVM-based 
and LLDA-based models.


1   Introduction

Entity relation detection (ERD) aims at finding rela- 
tions between pairs of Named Entities (NEs) in text. 
Availability of annotated corpora (NIST, 2003; Dod- 
dington et al., 2004) and introduction  of shared tasks 
(e.g. (Farkas et al., 2010; Carreras and Ma`rquez,
2005)) has spurred a large amount of research in this 
field in recent times. Researchers have used super- 
vised and semi-supervised approaches (Hasegawa et 
al., 2004; Mintz et al., 2009; Jiang, 2009), and ex- 
plored rich features (Kambhatla, 2004), kernel de- 
sign (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; 
Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Qian et al., 2008) and 
inference algorithms (Chan and Roth, 2011), to de- 
tect predefined relations between NEs.
  

In this work, we explore if and how the latent se- 
mantics of the text can help in detecting entity rela- 
tions. For this, we adapt the Latent Dirichlet Alloca- 
tion (LDA) approach to solve the ERD task. Specif- 
ically, we present  a ERD system  based on Maxi- 
mum Entropy Discriminant Latent Dirichlet Alloca- 
tion (MEDLDA). MEDLDA (Zhu et al., 2009), is 
an extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) 
that combines capability of capturing latent seman- 
tics with the discriminative capabilities of SVM.
  There  are a number  of challenges in employing 
the LDA framework for ERD. Latent Dirichlet Allo- 
cation and its supervised extensions such as Labeled 
LDA (LLDA) (Ramage et al., 2009) and supervised 
LDA (sLDA) (Blei and McAuliffe, 2008) are pow- 
erful generative models that capture the underlying 
semantics of texts. However, they have trouble dis- 
covering marginal classes and easily employing rich 
feature sets, both of which are important  for ERD. 
We overcome the first drawback by employing   a 
MEDLDA framework, which integrates maximum 
likelihood estimation (MLE) and maximum margin 
estimation (MME). Specifically, it is a combination 
of sLDA and support vector machines (SVMs).  Fur- 
ther, in order to employ rich and heterogeneous fea- 
tures we introduce  a separate exponential family dis- 
tribution for each feature,  similar to (Shan et al.,
2009), into our MEDLDA model.
  We formulate the relation detection task within 
the topic model framework  as follows. Pairs of NE 
mentions1  and the text between them is considered

     1 Adopting  the terminology  used in the Automatic  Context 
Extraction (ACE) program (NIST, 2003), specific NE instances 
are called mentions.


as mini-document.   Each mini-document  has a re- 
lation type (analogous to the response variable  in 
the supervised topic model). The topic model in- 
fers the topic (relation type) distribution of the mini- 
documents.  The supervised topic model discovers 
a latent topic representation of the mini-documents 
and a response  parameter  distribution. The topic 
representation is discovered with observed response 
variables during training. During testing, the topic 
distribution of each mini-document  can form a pre- 
diction of the relation types.
  We carry out experiments to measure the effec- 
tiveness of our approach and compare it to SVM- 
based and LLDA-based  models, as well as to a pre- 
vious work using the same corpora.  We also mea- 
sure and analyze the effectiveness of incorporating 
different features in our model relative to other mod- 
els. Our approach exhibits better overall precision, 
recall and Fmeasure than baseline systems. We also 
find that the MEDLDA-based  approach shows con- 
sistent capability for incorporation and improvement 
due to a variety of heterogeneous features.
  The rest of the paper is organized  as follows. We 
describe the proposed model in Section 2 and the 
features that we explore in this work in Section 3. 
Section 4 describes the data, experiments,  results 
and analyses.  We discuss the related work in Sec- 
tion 5 before concluding in Section 6.

2   MEDLDA for Relation Detection

MEDLDA is an extension of LDA proposed by Zhu, 
Ahmed  and Xing  (2009). LDA is itself unsuper- 
vised and the results  are often hard to interpret. 
However, with the addition of supervised informa- 
tion (such as response variables), the resulting topic 
models have much better predictive power for classi- 
fication and regression. In our work, we use relation 
annotations from the ACE (ACE, 2000 2005) corpus 
to provide the supervision.  NE pairs within a sen- 
tence, and the text between them are considered as 
a mini-document.   Each mini-document  is assumed 
to be composed of a set of topics. The topic model 
trained with these mini-documents given their rela- 
tion type label can generate topics biased toward re- 
lation types. Thus, the trained topic model will have 
good predictive power on relation types.
We first describe the MEDLDA model from (Zhu


et al., 2009) and then describe how we adapt it for 
relation detection using mixed membership exten- 
sions.

2.1   MEDLDA

 

Figure 1: MEDLDA

The MEDLDA model described in (Zhu et al.,
2009) is illustrated in Figure 12.
  Here, α is a k-dimensional  parameter of a Dirich- 
let distribution, β1:k are the parameters for k compo- 
nent distribution  over the words. Each component 
refers to a topic. In a collection  of documents D, 
each document w1:N  is generated from a sequence 
of topics z1:N . θ is a k-dimensional  topic distribu- 
tion variable, which is sampled from a Dirichlet  dis- 
tribution Dir(α).  Like common LDAs, MEDLDA 
uses independence  assumption  for a finite set of ran- 
dom variables z1, ..., zn which are independent and 
identically distributed, conditioned on the parame- 
ter θ. Like sLDA, MEDLDA is a supervised model. 
A response variable Y connected to each document 
is added for incorporating  supervised side informa- 
tion.  The supervised side information  is expected 
to make  MEDLDA topic discoveries  more inter- 
pretable. Zhu, Ahmed and Xing’s (2009) MEDLDA 
model can be used in both regression and classifi- 
cation. Concretely, Y is drawn from η1:c, a c k- 
dimensional vector which can be derived from suit- 
able statistical model. In our work, c is the num- 
ber of relation types. Note that the plate diagram 
for MEDLDA is quite similar to sLDA (Blei and 
McAuliffe, 2008). But there is a difference  – sLDA 
focuses on building  regression models, and thus the 
response variable Y in sLDA is generated by a nor- 
mal distribution.
  Based on the plate diagram, the joint distribution 
of latent and observable variables for our MEDLDA-
  2 (Zhu et al., 2009) do not have this plate digram in their 
paper; rather, we create this illustration  from the description of 
their model.


based relation  detection is given by

p(θ, z, w, y|α, β1:k , η1:c)


kN . The generative process for 
each document this model is as 
follows:


D 	N 	1. Sample a   component proportion  θd	∼


= n p(θd|α) × ( n p(zdn|θd)p(wdn|zdn, β1:k ))

Another important difference from sLDA lies in
the fact that MEDLDA does joint learning with both 
MME and MLE. The joint learning is done in two 
stages, unsupervised  topic discovery  and multi-class 
classification (we refer the reader to  (Zhu et al.,
2009) for details).  During training, EM algorithms 
are utilized to infer the posterior distribution  of the 
hidden variables θ, z and η. In testing, the trained 
models are used to predict relation types y.

2.2   Mixed Membership MEDLDA
Although the MEDLDA model described above can 
be applied to the relation detection and classification 
task, a few modifications are necessary before it can 
be effective  in predicting relation types. Mainly, a

limitation of LDA or other existing topic models is
the difficulty in incorporating rich features. This is 
because LDA is designed to handle data points with 
homogeneous features such as words.  But for rela- 
tion detection, like many other NLP tasks, it is im- 
portant to have the flexibility of incorporating part- 
of-speech tags, named entities, grammatical  depen- 
dencies and other linguistic  features. We overcome 
this limitation by introducing a separate exponential 
family distribution for each feature similar  to (Shan 
et al., 2009). Thus, our MEDLDA-based relation 
detection model is really a mixed-member Bayesian 
network. Figure 2 illustrates our model with this ex- 
tension.
  Figure 2 is very similar to Figure 1; the only dif- 
ference is that the topic component number k is now


(a) For n ∈ {1, ..., N}, sample zdn  = i ∼
Discrete(θd)
(b) For  n  ∈  {1,...,N},    sample wdn 	∼
P (wdn|βd  )

3. Sample		 the	relation	type		label 
from	a	softmax(z¯,η)	where	yd
T
sof tmax( 	exp(ηh z¯) 	)
h=1 exp(ηT z¯)

  In the sampling, index i is the number of the topic 
component which ranges from 1 : k. P (wdn|βd  ) in
2(b) is an exponential family distribution where i is 
from 1...k. Note that now we have βd   rather than 
only βd since we have drawn separate distributions 
for each word (or feature) n.
  Now,  our  MEDLDA-based relation-detection 
model can integrate  diverse  features of different 
types or the same features with different parameters.
  Following the generative  process, parameter  es- 
timation and inferences can be made  with either 
Gibbs sampling or variational methods. We use vari- 
ational methods since we adapt MEDLDA package3 
to mixed-membership MEDLDA and train relation 
detection models.

2.3   Relation Detection

With the generative process, inference and parame- 
ter estimation in place, we are ready to perform rela- 
tion detection. The first step is to perform variational 
inference given the testing instances.
  In classification, we estimate the probability of 
the relation type given topics and the response pa-
rameters, i.e. p(yd|zd1:dN , η1:c−1). With variational
approximation,  we can derive the prediction rule as
F (y, z1:N , η) = ηT f (y, z¯) where f (y, z¯) is a fea- 
ture vector. Now, SVM can be used to derive the

prediction rule. The final prediction can be general- 
ized exactly  the same as Zhu, Ahmed  and Xing (Zhu 
et al., 2009):
yˆ = argmaxy E[ηT f (y, Z¯)|α, β]	(2)

3   Features

We explore the effectiveness of incorporating fea- 
tures into our systems as well as the baselines.  For 
this, we construct feature sets similar to Jiang and 
Zhai (2007) and Zhou (2005). Three kinds of fea- 
tures are employed:

1. BOW The Bag of Words (BOW) feature cap- 
tures all the words in our mini-document. It 
comprises of the words of the two NE mentions 
and the words between them.

2. SYN The SYN features are constructed to cap- 
ture syntactic,  semantic and structural infor- 
mation of the mini-document. They include 
features  such  as HM1 (the head word of the 
first mention), HM2 (the head word of the sec- 
ond mention), ET1, ET2, M1 and M2 (Entity 
types and mention  types of the two mentions 
involved), #MB (number of other mentions in 
between the two mentions), #WB (number of 
words in between the two mentions).

3. COMP The COMP features are composite fea- 
tures that are similar to SYN, but they addition- 
ally capture language order and dependencies 
between the features mentioned above.  These 
include  features such as HM1HM2 (combining 
head word of mention 1 and head word of men- 
tion 2) , ET12 (combinations of mention entity 
type), ML12 (combination of mention levels), 
M1InM2 or M2InM1 (flag indicating whether 
M2/M1 is included in M1/M2).

  The main intuitions behind employing composite 
features, COMP,  are as follows. First, they capture 
the ordering information.  The ordering of words are 
not captured by BOW. That is, BOW features  as- 
sume exchangeability.  This works for models based 
on random or seeded sampling  (e.g. LDA) – as long 
as words  sampled  are associated with a topic, the 
hidden topics of the documents can be discovered. 
In the case of ERD, this assumption might work


with symmetric relations.  However, when the rela- 
tions are asymmetric, ordering information is impor- 
tant. Composite  features such as HM1HM2 encodes 
what mention head word precedes the other. Second, 
features such as M1InM2 or M2InM1 capture token 
dependencies. Besides exchangeability,  LDA-based 
models also assume that words are conditionally in- 
dependent. Consequently, the system cannot capture 
the knowledge that some mentions may be included 
in other mentions. By constructing  features such as 
M1InM2 or M2InM1, we encode the dependency in- 
formation explicitly.

4   Experiments

As MEDLDA is a combination  of maximum mar- 
gin principle with maximum likelihood estimation 
for topic modes, we compare it with two baseline 
systems.  The first, SVM,  uses only the maximum 
margin principle,  while the second, LLDA, uses only 
maximum likelihood estimation for topic modeling.

4.1   Data
We use the ACE corpus (Phase 2, 2005) for eval- 
uation. The ACE corpus has annotations  for both 
entities and relations.  The corpus has six major re- 
lations types, 23 subtypes and 7 entity types. In this 
work, we focus only on the six high-level relation 
types listed in Table 1. In addition to the the 6 ma- 
jor types, we have an additional category, no relation 
(NO-REL),  that exists between entities that are not 
related.
  The data for our experiments consists of pairs of 
NEs from a sentence, and the gold standard annota- 
tion of their relation type (or NO-REL). All relations 
in the ACE corpus are intra-sentential  and hence we 
do not create NE pairs that cross sentence bound- 
aries. Also, almost all positive instances are within 
two mentions of each other. Hence, we create NE 
pairs for only those NEs that have at most 2 interven- 
ing NEs in between. This gives us a total of 38,342 
relation instances of which 32,640 are negative in- 
stances (NO-REL) and 5702 are positive relation in- 
stances belonging  to one of the 6 categories.

4.2   Experimental Setup
We use 80% of the instances for training  and 20% 
for testing. The topic numbers and the penalty pa- 
rameter of the cost function  C are first determined

for each of the models (wherever applicable) using 
the training data. Best parameters are determined 
for the three conditions: 1) BOW features alone 
BOW, 2) BOW plus SYN features (PlusSYN) and 3) 
BOW plus SYN and COMP features (PlusCOMP). 
All systems achieved their overall best performance 
with PlusCOMP  features (see Section 4.4 for a de- 
tailed analysis).

4.2.1  MEDLDA

  The number of topics are determined  using the 
equation  2K0  + K1  following Zhu, Ahmed and 
Xing (2009)  and K1   =  2K0.  K0  is the number 
of topics per class and K1 is the number of topics 
shared by all relation types. The choice of topics is 
based on the intuition that the shared component K1 
should use all class labels to model common latent 
structure while non-overlapping components should 
model specific characteristics data from each class. 
The ratio of topics is based on the understanding  that 
shared topics may be more than topics of each class. 
The specific numbers do not produce much variation 
in the final results. We experimented with the fol- 
lowing number of topics: 20, 40, 70, 80, 90, 100,
110.  BOW, PlusSYN, and PlusCOMP configura- 
tions obtain the best performance for 90 topics, 80 
topics, and 70 topics respectively.
  Since SVMs are employed  in the MEDLDA im- 
plementation, we need to determine the penalty pa- 
rameter of the cost function, C. We used 5 fold cross- 
validation  to locate the parameter C. The best values 
for C are 25, 28, 30 respectively for BOW, PlusSYN


and PlusCOMP configurations. We  used a linear 
kernel  as it is the most commonly  used kernel for 
text classification tasks. Since MEDLDA is run by 
sampling, the result may be different  each time. We 
ran it 5 times for each setting and took the average 
as the final results.

4.2.2  LLDA and SVM
  The setting of topics for LLDA  is similar to 
MEDLDA. As LLDA is also run by sampling, we 
ran it 5 times for each setting and took the average 
as the final results. In SVMlight, a grid search tool 
is provided to locate the the best value for parame- 
ter C. The best C for all three conditions was found 
to be 1.  All other settings for the two models are 
similar to those of MEDLDA.

Table 3: Multi-class  Classification Results with PlusCOMP for SVM, LLDA and MEDLDA for the six ACE 05 
categories and NO-REL




SVM across all metrics. Specifically,  there is a 15 
percentage point improvement  in Fmeasure over the 
best performing  baseline. This result indicates that 
our approach of combining topic model with max- 
margin learning is effective for relation detection.
  Now, looking at the results for each individual 
relationship  category  (see Table 3; the best num- 
bers for each category  and metric are highlighted 
in bold) we see that the Fmeasure for MEDLDA is 
better than that for SVM for 4 out of the 6 ACE re- 
lation types; and better than the Fmeasure obtained 
by LLDA for all relation  types except ORG-AFF. 
Specifically,  comparing with the best performing 
baseline, MEDLDA produces a Fmeasure improve- 
ment 27 percentage points  for ART, 3 percentage 
points for PART-WHOLE and 50 percentage points 
for PER-SOC. Also, for four of the six ACE rela- 
tion types, MEDLDA achieves the best precision. 
Even in the cases where MEDLDA is not the best 
performer for a relation category, its performance is 
not very poor (unlike, for example, SVM for PART- 
WHOLE  and LLDA for ART, respectively).
  Interestingly, the NO-REL category   reveals  a 
sharp contrast  in the performance  of SVM and 
LLDA.  NO-REL is a  difficult, catch-all category 
that is a mixture  of data with diverse distributions. 
This is a category where maximum-margin learning 
is more effective than maximum-likelihood  estima- 
tion. Notice that MEDLDA achieves performance 
close to SVM for this category. This is because, 
even though both LLDA and MEDLDA model hid- 
den topics and then employ discovered hidden topics 
to predict relation types, MEDLDA does joint infer- 
ence of MLE and MME. This joint inference helps


to improve the detection of NO-REL.
  Finally, we also compare our system’s results (us- 
ing PlusCOMP features) with the results of previ- 
ous research on the same corpus (Khayyamian et al.,
2009). They use similar experimental settings: ev- 
ery pair of entities within a sentence is regarded to 
involve a negative relation instance unless it is anno- 
tated as positive  in the corpus. A similar filter (they 
use a distance filter) is used to sift out unrelated neg- 
ative instances. Their train/test ratio of data split is 
also the same as ours.
  Khayyamian,   Mirroshandel  and   Abolhas- 
sani (2009) employ state-of-art  kernel methods 
developed by Collins and Duffy (2002) and only 
report Fmeasures over the six ACE relation types. 
For clarity, we reproduce their results in Table 4 
and repeat MEDLDA Fmeasures from Table 3 in 
the last column. The last row (Overall) reports the 
macro-averages computed over all relation types for 
each system. Here we see that overall, MEDLDA 
outperforms all kernels. MEDLDA also performs 
better than the best kernel for four of the six relation 
types.

4.4   Analysis

As mentioned previously, all three systems achieved 
their overall best performance with PlusCOMP fea- 
tures. Here, we analyze if informative  features are 
consistently  useful and if the systems can harness 
the informative  features consistently  across all re- 
lation types. Figures 3, 4 and 5 illustrate the F- 
measures for SVM, LLDA and MEDLDA respec- 
tively for the three conditions:  BOW, PlusSYN and 
PlusCOMP.

Figure 5: MEDLDA Fmeausres for 3 feature conditions

  Let us first look at the best systems (based on 
Fmeasure) for each of the six ACE relation  types 
in  Table 3,  and look at what feature set  pro-


duces the best result for that system and relation. 
MEDLDA is the best performer  for ART, PART- 
WHOLE and PER-SOC  in Table 3.  Figure 5 re- 
veals that MEDLDA’s best performance for these re- 
lation types are obtained using PlusCOMP features. 
Similarly SVM obtains the best Fmeasure for GEN- 
AFF and PHYS relations and Figure 3 shows that 
SVM achieves its best performance  for these cate- 
gories using PlusCOMP. We also see a similar trend 
with LLDA and the ORG-AFF  relation type. These 
results corroborate intuition from previous research 
that informative  features are important  for relation 
type recognition.  The only exception to this is the 
performance of SVM for NO-REL. This is not sur- 
prising,  as the features we use are focused on deter- 
mining true relation types and NO-REL  is a mixture 
of all cases (and features) where relations  do not ex- 
ist.
  Further analysis of the figures reveal that even 
though there is a general trend towards better per- 
formance with addition of more informative fea- 
tures, not all systems show consistent improvements 
across all relation types with the addition of com- 
posite features. That is, some systems get degraded 
performance due to feature addition. For example, 
in Figure 3, we see that the SVM with PlusCOMP 
features is outperformed by SVM with PlusSYN for 
ART and SVM with BOW for NO-REL. The gains 
from features  are also inconsistent in the case of 
LLDA (Figure 4).  While the LLDA system with 
PlusSYN features always improves over the one us- 
ing BOW, the performance drops considerably when 
using PlusCOMP features for ART and GEN-AFF. 
On the other hand, MEDLDA (see Figure 5) shows 
more consistent improvement for all relation types 
with the addition of more complex features.  Also,


the gains are more substantial.  This is encouraging 
and opens up avenues for further exploration.

5   Related Work

Previous research has explored various methods and 
features for relationship detection and mining. Ker- 
nel methods  have  been popularly used  for rela- 
tion detection.  Some examples are are dependency 
tree kernels  (Culotta and Sorensen,  2004), short- 
est dependency path kernels (Bunescu and Mooney,
2005), and more recently, convolution  tree kernels 
(Zhao and Grishman,  2005; Zhang et al., 2006) 
context-sensitive convolution  tree kernels (Zhou et 
al., 2007) and dynamic syntax tree kernels (Qian et 
al., 2008). Kernel methods for relation extraction 
focus on representing and capturing  the structured 
information of the text between the entities.  In our 
MEDLDA model, instead of computing  distances 
between subtrees, we sample topics based on their 
distributions. The sampling is not only on the (mini) 
document level, but also on the word level or on the 
syntactic or semantic level. Our model focuses on 
addressing the underlying  semantics more directly 
than typical kernel-based methods.
  Chan and Roth (2011) employ constraints  us- 
ing an integer linear programming (ILP) framework. 
Using this, they apply rich linguistic and knowledge- 
based constraints based on coreference annotations, 
a hierarchy  of relations, syntacto-semantic structure, 
and knowledge  from Wikipedia. In our work, we 
focus on capturing the latent semantics of the text 
between the NEs.
A variety of features have been explored for ERD
in previous research (Zhou et al., 2005; Zhou et al.,
2008; Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Miller et al., 2000). 
Syntactic  features such as POS tags and dependency 
path between  entities; semantic  features such as 
Word-Net  relations, semantic parse trees and types 
of NEs; and structural features such as which entity 
came first in the sentence have been found useful for 
ERD. We too observe the utility of informative fea- 
tures for this task. However, exploration of the fea- 
ture space is not the main focus of this work. Rather, 
our focus is on whether the models are capable of 
incorporating rich features.  A fuller exploration of 
rich heterogeneous features is the focus of our fu- 
ture work.
  

A closely related task is that of relation min- 
ing  and discovery, where unsupervised,  semi- 
supervised  approaches  have  been  effectively em- 
ployed (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Mintz et al., 2009; 
Jiang, 2009). For example, Hasegawa et al. (2004) 
use clustering  and entity type information, while 
Mintz et al. (2009) employ distant supervision. Our 
ERD task is different from these  as we focus on 
classifying the relation types into predefined relation 
types in the ACE05 corpus.
  Topic models have been applied previously  for a 
number of NLP tasks (e.g. (Lin et al., 2006; Titov 
and McDonald,  2008). LDAs have also been em- 
ployed to reduce feature dimensions in relation de- 
tection  systems (Hachey,  2006). However, to the 
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to make 
use of topic models to perform relation detection.


6   Conclusion and Future Work


In  this work,  we presented   a  system for  en- 
tity relation  detection based on mixed-membership 
MEDLDA. Our approach was motivated by the idea 
that combination of max margin and maximum like- 
lihood can help to improve relation detection task. 
For this, we adapted the existing work on MEDLDA 
and mixed membership models and formulated  ERD 
as a topic  detection  task. To the best of our knowl- 
edge, this is the first work to make full use of topic 
models for relation detection.
  Our experiments show that the proposed approach 
achieves  better overall performance  than SVM- 
based and LLDA-based  approaches across all met- 
rics. We also experimented with different features 
and the effectiveness of the different models for har- 
nessing these features.  Our analysis show that our 
MEDLDA-based approach is able to effectively and 
consistently incorporate informative features.
  As   a    model  that  incorporates maximum- 
likelihood, maximum-margin  and mixed mem- 
bership  learning, MEDLDA  has  the potential of 
incorporating rich kernel functions or conditional 
topic random fields (CTRF) (Zhu and Xing, 2010). 
These are some of the promising directions for our 
future exploration.
