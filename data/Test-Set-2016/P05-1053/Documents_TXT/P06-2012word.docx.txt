Abstract


This paper presents an unsupervised learn- 
ing approach to disambiguate various rela- 
tions between name entities by use of vari- 
ous lexical and syntactic features from the 
contexts.  It works by calculating eigen- 
vectors of an adjacency graph’s Laplacian 
to recover a submanifold of data from a 
high dimensionality space and then per- 
forming cluster number estimation on the 
eigenvectors. Experiment results on ACE 
corpora show that  this  spectral cluster- 
ing based approach outperforms the other 
clustering methods.


1   Introduction

In this paper, we address the task of relation extrac- 
tion, which is to find relationships between name en- 
tities in a given context. Many methods have been 
proposed to deal with this task, including supervised 
learning algorithms (Miller et al., 2000; Zelenko et 
al., 2002; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla,
2004;  Zhou et al.,  2005), semi-supervised learn- 
ing algorithms (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano,
2000; Zhang, 2004), and unsupervised learning al- 
gorithm (Hasegawa et al., 2004).
  Among these methods, supervised learning is usu- 
ally more preferred when a large amount of la- 
beled training data  is  available.    However,  it  is 
time-consuming and labor-intensive to manually tag 
a large amount of training data.   Semi-supervised 
learning methods have been put forward to mini- 
mize the corpus annotation requirement.  Most of


semi-supervised methods employ the bootstrapping 
framework, which only need to pre-define some ini- 
tial seeds for any particular relation, and then boot- 
strap from the seeds to acquire the relation.  How- 
ever, it is often quite difficult to enumerate all class 
labels in the initial seeds and decide an “optimal” 
number of them.
  Compared with supervised and semi-supervised 
methods, Hasegawa et al. (2004)’s unsupervised ap- 
proach for relation extraction can overcome the dif- 
ficulties on requirement of a large amount of labeled 
data and enumeration of all class labels. Hasegawa 
et al. (2004)’s method is to use a hierarchical cluster- 
ing method to cluster pairs of named entities accord- 
ing to the similarity of context words intervening be- 
tween the named entities. However, the drawback of 
hierarchical clustering is that it required providing 
cluster number by users. Furthermore, clustering is 
performed in original high dimensional space, which 
may induce non-convex clusters hard to identified.
  This paper presents a novel application of spec- 
tral clustering technique to unsupervised relation ex- 
traction problem. It works by calculating eigenvec- 
tors of an adjacency graph’s Laplacian to recover a 
submanifold of data from a high dimensional space, 
and then performing cluster number estimation on 
a transformed space defined by the first few eigen- 
vectors. This method may help us find non-convex 
clusters. It also does not need to pre-define the num- 
ber of the context clusters or pre-specify the simi- 
larity threshold for the clusters as Hasegawa et al. 
(2004)’s method.
  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec- 
tion 2 formulates unsupervised relation extraction 
and presents how to apply the spectral clustering

experiments and results. Finally we will give a con- 
clusion about our work in section 4.

2   Unsupervised Relation Extraction
Problem

Assume that two occurrences of entity pairs with 
similar contexts, are tend to hold the same relation 
type.  Thus unsupervised relation extraction prob- 
lem can be formulated as partitioning collections of 
entity pairs into clusters according to the similarity 
of contexts, with each cluster containing only entity 
pairs labeled by the same relation type. And then, in 
each cluster, the most representative words are iden- 
tified from the contexts of entity pairs to induce the 
label of relation type.  Here, we only focus on the 
clustering subtask and do not address the relation 
type labeling subtask.
  In the next subsections we will describe our pro- 
posed method for unsupervised relation extraction, 
which includes: 1) Collect the context vectors in 
which the entity mention pairs co-occur; 2) Cluster 
these Context vectors.

2.1   Context Vector and Feature Design


Entity Type: the entity type of both entities, which 
can be PERSON, ORGANIZATION, FACIL- 
ITY, LOCATION and GPE.

POS features: Part-Of-Speech tags corresponding 
to all words in the two entities and three con- 
text windows.

Chunking features: This category of features are 
extracted from the chunklink representation, 
which includes:

• Chunk tag information of the two enti- 
ties and three context windows.  The “0” 
tag means that the word is outside of any 
chunk.  The “I-XP” tag means that this 
word is inside an XP chunk. The “B-XP” 
by default means that the word is at the 
beginning of an XP chunk.
• Grammatical function of the two entities 
and three context windows. The last word 
in each chunk is its head, and the function 
of the head is the function of the whole 
chunk.  “NP-SBJ” means a NP chunk as 
the subject of the sentence.   The other 
words in a chunk that are not the head have 
“NOFUNC” as their function.


Let X = {xi}n


be the set of 
context vectors of 
oc-



currences of all entity mention pairs, where xi



repre-


• IOB-chains of the heads of the two enti-
ties. So-called IOB-chain, noting the syn-


sents the context vector of the i-th occurrence, and n
is the total number of occurrences of all entity men- 
tion pairs.
  Each occurrence of entity mention pairs can be 
denoted as follows:

R → (Cpre, e1, Cmid, e2, Cpost) 	(1)

where e1 and e2 represents the entity mentions, and 
Cpre,Cmid,and Cpost are the contexts before, be- 
tween and after the entity mention pairs respectively.
  We extracted features from e1, e2, Cpre, Cmid, 
Cpost to construct context vectors, which are com- 
puted from the parse trees derived from Charniak 
Parser (Charniak, 1999) and the Chunklink script 1 
written by Sabine Buchholz from Tilburg University.

Words: Words in the two entities and three context 
windows.

tactic categories of all the constituents on 
the path from the root node to this leaf 
node of tree.

  We combine the above lexical and syntactic fea- 
tures with their position information in the context 
to form the context vector. Before that, we filter out 
low frequency features which appeared only once in 
the entire set.

2.2   Context Clustering

Once the context vectors of entity pairs are prepared, 
we come to the second stage of our method: cluster 
these context vectors automatically.
  In recent years, spectral clustering technique has 
received more and more attention as a powerful ap- 
proach to a range of clustering problems.  Among 
the efforts on spectral clustering techniques (Weiss,
1999; Kannan et al., 2000; Shi et al., 2000; Ng et al.,
2001; Zha et al., 2001), we adopt a modified version

1.	Construct an affinity matrix by Aij  = exp(− ij
j, 0 if i = j.  Here, sij  is the similarity between xi  and
xj  calculated by Cosine similarity measure. and the free 
distance parameter σ2 is used to scale the weights;
2.	Normalize the affinity matrix A to create the matrix L =
D−1/2 AD−1/2 , where D is a diagonal matrix whose (i,i)
element is the sum of A’s ith row;
3.	Set q = 2;
4.	Compute q eigenvectors of L with greatest eigenvalues.
Arrange them in a matrix Y .
5.	Perform elongated K -means with q + 1 centers on Y , 
initializing the (q + 1)-th mean in the origin;
6.	If the q + 1-th cluster contains any data points, then there 
must be at least an extra cluster; set q  = q + 1 and go 
back to step 4.  Otherwise, algorithm stops and outputs
         clustered data and number of clusters.



(Sanguinetti et al., 2005) of the algorithm by Ng et 
al. (2001) because it can provide us model order se- 
lection capability.
  Since we do not know how many relation types 
in advance and do not have any labeled relation 
training examples at hand, the problem of model 
order selection arises, i.e.   estimating the “opti- 
mal” number of clusters.  Formally, let k be the 
model order, we need to find k in Equation:  k = 
argmaxk {criterion(k)}.  Here, the criterion is de- 
fined on the result of spectral clustering.
  Table 1 shows the details of the whole algorithm 
for context clustering, which contains two main 
stages: 1) Transformation of Clustering Space (Step
1-4); 2) Clustering in the transformed space using
Elongated K-means algorithm (Step 5-6).

2.3   Transformation of Clustering Space

We represent each context vector of entity pair as a 
node in an undirected graph. Each edge (i,j) in the 
graph is assigned a weight that reflects the similarity 
between two context vectors i and j. Hence, the re- 
lation extraction task for entity pairs can be defined 
as a partition of the graph so that entity pairs that 
are more similar to each other, e.g.  labeled by the 
same relation type, belong to the same cluster. As a 
relaxation of such NP-hard discrete graph partition- 
ing problem, spectral clustering technique computes 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Laplacian matrix


related to the given graph, and construct data clus- 
ters based on such spectral information.
  Thus the starting point of context clustering is to 
construct an affinity matrix A from the data, which 
is an n × n matrix encoding the distances between 
the various points.  The affinity matrix is then nor- 
malized to form a matrix L by conjugating with the 
the diagonal matrix D−1/2  which has as entries the 
square roots of the sum of the rows of A. This is to 
take into account the different spread of the various 
clusters (points belonging to more rarified clusters 
will have lower sums of the corresponding row of 
A).  It is straightforward to prove that L is positive 
definite and has eigenvalues smaller or equal to 1, 
with equality holding in at least one case.
  Let K be the true number of clusters present in 
the dataset. If K is known beforehand, the first K 
eigenvectors of L will be computed and arranged as 
columns in a matrix Y . Each row of Y corresponds 
to a context vector of entity pair, and the above pro- 
cess can be considered as transforming the original 
context vectors in a d-dimensional space to new con- 
text vectors in the K -dimensional space. Therefore, 
the rows of Y will cluster upon mutually orthogonal 
points on the K dimensional sphere,rather than on 
the coordinate axes.

2.4   The Elongated K-means algorithm

As the step 5 of Table 1 shows, the result of elon- 
gated K -means algorithm is used to detect whether 
the number of clusters selected q is less than the true 
number K , and allows one to iteratively obtain the 
number of clusters.
  Consider the case when the number of clusters q 
is less than the true cluster number K present in the 
dataset.  In such situation, taking the first q  < K 
eigenvectors, we will be selecting a q-dimensional 
subspace in the clustering space. As the rows of the 
K eigenvectors clustered along mutually orthogo- 
nal vectors, their projections in a lower dimensional 
space will cluster along radial directions. Therefore, 
the general picture will be of q clusters elongated in 
the radial direction, with possibly some clusters very 
near the origin (when the subspace is orthogonal to 
some of the discarded eigenvectors).
  Hence,  the K -means algorithm is modified as 
the elongated K -means algorithm to downweight 
distances along radial directions and penalize dis-


4
tances along transversal directions.  The elongated
K -means algorithm computes the distance of point
2	x from the center ci as follows:
1
0	• If the center is not very near the origin, cT ci  > E (E is a 
parameter to be fixed by the user), the distances are cal-
culated as: edist(x, ci ) = (x − ci )T M (x − ci ), where

distance.

In each iteration of procedure in Table 
1, elon- gated K -means is initialized with 
q centers corre- sponding to data points in 
different clusters and one center in the 
origin. The algorithm then will drag the 
center in the origin towards one of the 
clusters not accounted for.  Compute 
another eigenvector (thus increasing the 
dimension of the clustering space to q + 1) 
and repeat the procedure. Eventually, when 
one reach as many eigenvectors as the 
number of clusters present in the data, no 
points will be as- signed to the center at the 
origin, leaving the cluster empty. This is the 
signal to terminate the algorithm.

ber of the instances that belong to both the i-th es- 
timated cluster and j-th ground truth class.  More- 
over, to ensure that any two clusters do not share 
the same labels of relation types, we adopt a per- 
mutation procedure to find an one-to-one mapping 
function Ω from the ground truth classes (relation 
types) T C to the estimated clustering result EC . 
There are at most |T C | clusters which are assigned 
relation type tags.  And if the number of the esti- 
mated clusters is less than the number of the ground 
truth clusters, empty clusters should be added so that
|EC | = |T C | and the one-to-one mapping can be 
performed, which can be formulated as the function:


Ωˆ  = arg maxΩ    |T C | tΩ(j),j , where Ω(j) is the in-
dex of the estimated cluster associated with the j-th
class.
  Given the result of one-to-one mapping, we adopt 
Precision, Recall and F-measure to evaluate the 
clustering result.





3   Experiments and Results

3.1   Data Setting

Our proposed unsupervised relation extraction is 
evaluated on ACE 2003 corpus, which contains 519 
files from sources including broadcast, newswire, 
and newspaper.  We only deal with intra-sentence 
explicit relations and assumed that all entities have 
been detected beforehand in the EDT sub-task of 
ACE. To verify our proposed method, we only col- 
lect those pairs of entity mentions which have been 
tagged relation types in the given corpus. Then the 
relation type tags were removed to test the unsuper- 
vised relation disambiguation.  During the evalua- 
tion procedure, the relation type tags were used as 
ground truth classes.  A break-down of the data by



3.3   Experimental Design
We perform our unsupervised relation extraction on 
the devtest set of ACE corpus and evaluate the al- 
gorithm on relation subtype level.  Firstly, we ob- 
serve the influence of various variables, including 
Distance Parameter σ2, Different Features, Context 
Window Size. Secondly, to verify the effectiveness 
of our method, we further compare it with other two 
unsupervised methods.

3.3.1   Choice of Distance Parameter σ2
  We simply search over σ2  and pick the value 
that finds the best aligned set of clusters on the 
transformed space.  Here, the scattering criterion 
trace(P −1PB ) is used to compare the cluster qual- 
ity for different value of σ2 3, which measures the ra- 
tio of between-cluster to within-cluster scatter. The 
higher the trace(P −1PB ),  the higher the cluster


24 relation subtypes is given in Table 2.

3.2   Evaluation method for clustering result

When assessing the agreement between clustering 
result and manually annotated relation types (ground 
truth classes), we would encounter the problem that


quality.
  In Table 3 and Table 4, with different settings of 
feature set and context window size, we find out the
  3  trace(P −1 PB ) is trace of a matrix which is the sum of 
its diagonal elements.  PW   is the within-cluster scatter matrix
as:  PW    =   	 


i ∈χj (Xi  − mj )(Xi  − mj )


and PB


there was no relation type tags for each cluster in our


is the between-cluster scatter matrix as: PB  =    c 	j


clustering results.
To resolve the problem, we construct a contin-


m)(mj  − m)t , where m is the total mean vector and mj   is
the mean vector for jth cluster and (Xj  − mj )t is the matrix 
transpose of the column vector (Xj  − mj ).

3.3.2   Contribution of Different Features
  As the previous section presented, we incorporate 
various lexical and syntactic features to extract rela- 
tion.  To measure the contribution of different fea- 
tures, we report the performance by gradually in- 
creasing the feature set, as Table 3 shows.
  Table 3 shows that all of the four categories of fea- 
tures contribute to the improvement of performance 
more or less. Firstly,the addition of entity type fea- 
ture is very useful, which improves F-measure by
6.6%.  Secondly, adding POS features can increase 
F-measure score but do not improve very much. 
Thirdly, chunking features also show their great use- 
fulness with increasing Precision/Recall/F-measure 
by 5.7%/2.5%/4.5%.
  We combine all these features to do all other eval- 
uations in our experiments.

3.3.3   Setting of Context Window Size
  We have mentioned in Section 2 that the context 
vectors of entity pairs are derived from the contexts 
before, between and after the entity mention pairs. 
Hence, we have to specify the three context window 
size first. In this paper, we set the mid-context win- 
dow as everything between the two entity mentions. 
For the pre- and post- context windows, we could 
have different choices.  For example, if we specify 
the outer context window size as 2, then it means that 
the pre-context (post-context)) includes two words 
before (after) the first (second) entity.
  For comparison of the effect of the outer context 
of entity mention pairs, we conducted three different


based clustering) compared with other unsupervised methods: 
((Hasegawa et al., 2004))’s clustering method and K-means 
clustering.

settings of context window size (0, 2, 5) as Table 4 
shows. From this table we can find that with the con- 
text window size setting, 2, the algorithm achieves 
the best performance of 43.5%/49.4%/46.3% in 
Precision/Recall/F-measure. With the context win- 
dow size setting, 5, the performance becomes worse 
because extending the context too much may include 
more features, but at the same time, the noise also 
increases.

3.3.4	Comparison with other Unsupervised 
methods
  In (Hasegawa et al., 2004), they preformed un- 
supervised relation extraction based on hierarchical 
clustering and they only used word features between 
entity mention pairs to construct context vectors. We 
reported the clustering results using the same clus- 
tering strategy as Hasegawa et al. (2004) proposed. 
In Table 5, Hasegawa’s Method1 means the test used 
the word feature as Hasegawa et al. (2004) while 
Hasegawa’s Method2 means the test used the same 
feature set as our method. In both tests, we specified 
the cluster number as the number of ground truth 
classes.
  We also approached the relation extraction prob- 
lem  using  the  standard  clustering  technique,  K-


means, where we adopted the same feature set de- 
fined in our proposed method to cluster the con- 
text vectors of entity mention pairs and pre-specified 
the cluster number as the number of ground truth 
classes.
  Table 5 reports the performance of our proposed 
method comparing with the other two unsupervised 
methods. Table 5 shows our proposed spectral based 
method clearly outperforms the other two unsuper- 
vised methods by 12.5% and 9.5% in F-measure re- 
spectively.  Moreover, the incorporation of various 
lexical and syntactic features into Hasegawa et al. 
(2004)’s method2 makes it outperform Hasegawa et 
al. (2004)’s method1 which only uses word feature.

3.4   Discussion

In this paper, we have shown that the modified spec- 
tral clustering technique, with various lexical and 
syntactic features derived from the context of entity 
pairs, performed well on the unsupervised relation 
extraction problem.  Our experiments show that by 
the choice of the distance parameter σ2, we can esti- 
mate the cluster number which provides the tightest 
clusters. We notice that the estimated cluster num- 
ber is less than the number of ground truth classes 
in most cases. The reason for this phenomenon may 
be that some relation types can not be easily distin- 
guished using the context information only. For ex- 
ample, the relation subtypes “Located”, “Based-In” 
and “Residence” are difficult to disambiguate even 
for human experts to differentiate.
  The results also show that various lexical and 
syntactic features contain useful information for the 
task.  Especially, although we did not concern the 
dependency tree and full parse tree information as 
other supervised methods (Miller et al., 2000; Cu- 
lotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et 
al., 2005), the incorporation of simple features, such 
as words and chunking information, still can provide 
complement information for capturing the character- 
istics of entity pairs.  This perhaps dues to the fact 
that two entity mentions are close to each other in 
most of relations defined in ACE. Another observa- 
tion from the result is that extending the outer con- 
text window of entity mention pairs too much may 
not improve the performance since the process may 
incorporate more noise information and affect the 
clustering result.
  

As regards the clustering technique, the spectral- 
based clustering performs better than direct cluster- 
ing, K-means.  Since the spectral-based algorithm 
works in a transformed space of low dimension- 
ality, data can be easily clustered so that the al- 
gorithm can be implemented with better efficiency 
and speed.  And the performance using spectral- 
based clustering can be improved due to the reason 
that spectral-based clustering overcomes the draw- 
back of K-means (prone to local minima) and may 
find non-convex clusters consistent with human in- 
tuition.
  Generally, from the point of view of unsu- 
pervised resolution for relation extraction, our 
approach  already  achieves  best  performance  of
43.5%/49.4%/46.3% in Precision/Recall/F-measure
compared with other clustering methods.

4   Conclusion and Future work

In this paper, we approach unsupervised relation ex- 
traction problem by using spectral-based clustering 
technique with diverse lexical and syntactic features 
derived from context. The advantage of our method 
is that it doesn’t need any manually labeled relation 
instances, and pre-definition the number of the con- 
text clusters. Experiment results on the ACE corpus 
show that our method achieves better performance 
than other unsupervised methods, i.e.Hasegawa et 
al. (2004)’s method and Kmeans-based method.
  Currently we combine various lexical and syn- 
tactic features to construct context vectors for clus- 
tering.  In the future we will further explore other 
semantic information to assist the relation extrac- 
tion problem.  Moreover, instead of cosine similar- 
ity measure to calculate the distance between con- 
text vectors, we will try other distributional similar- 
ity measures to see whether the performance of re- 
lation extraction can be improved. In addition, if we 
can find an effective unsupervised way to filter out 
unrelated entity pairs in advance, it would make our 
proposed method more practical.
