Abstract

In this paper we introduce the new task of 
social event extraction from text. We distin- 
guish two broad types of social events depend- 
ing on whether only one or both parties are 
aware of the social contact. We annotate part 
of Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) data, 
and perform experiments using Support Vec- 
tor Machines with Kernel  methods.  We use a 
combination of structures derived from phrase 
structure trees and dependency trees. A char- 
acteristic of our events (which distinguishes 
them from ACE events) is that the participat- 
ing entities can be spread far across the parse 
trees. We use syntactic and semantic insights 
to devise a new structure derived from depen- 
dency trees and show that this plays a role in 
achieving the best performing system for both 
social event detection and classification tasks. 
We also use three data sampling  approaches 
to solve the problem of data skewness. Sam- 
pling methods improve the F1-measure for the 
task of relation detection by over 20% abso- 
lute over the baseline.


1   Introduction

This paper introduces a novel natural language pro- 
cessing (NLP) task, social event extraction.  We are 
interested in this task because it contributes to our 
overall research goal, which is to extract  a social 
network from written text. The extracted social net- 
work can be used for various  applications  such as 
summarization, question-answering, or the detection 
of main characters in a story. For example, we man- 
ually extracted the social network of characters in


Alice in Wonderland and ran standard social network 
analysis algorithms on the network. The most influ- 
ential characters in the story were correctly detected. 
Moreover, characters occurring in a scene together 
were given same social roles and positions.  Social 
network extraction has recently been applied to lit- 
erary theory (Elson et al., 2010) and has the potential 
to help organize novels that are becoming machine 
readable.

  We take a “social network”  to be a network  con- 
sisting of individual human beings and groups of hu- 
man beings who are connected to each other by the 
virtue of participating in social events.  We define 
social events to be events that occur between peo- 
ple where at least one person is aware of the other 
and of the event taking place. For example, in the 
sentence John talks to Mary, entities John and Mary 
are aware of each other  and the talking event.   In 
the sentence John thinks Mary is great, only John is 
aware of Mary and the event is the thinking event. 
In the sentence Rabbit ran by Alice there is no evi- 
dence about the cognitive  states of Rabbit and Alice 
(because the Rabbit could have run by Alice without 
any one of them noticing  each other). A text can de- 
scribe a social network  in two ways: explicitly, by 
stating the type of relationship between two individ- 
uals (e.g. husband-wife), or implicitly, by describing 
an event which  creates or perpetuates a social rela- 
tionship (e.g. John talked to Mary). We will call 
these types of events social events. We define two 
types of social events:  interaction,  in which both 
parties  are aware of the social event (e.g., a conver- 
sation),  and observation, in which only one party 
is aware of the interaction (e.g., thinking about or

spying on someone). Note that the notion of cogni- 
tive state is crucial to our definition. This paper is 
the first attempt to detect and classify social events 
present in text.
  Our task is different from related tasks, notably 
from the Automated Content Extraction (ACE) rela- 
tion and event extraction tasks because the events are 
different  (they are a class of events defined through 
the effect on participants’  cognitive  state), and the 
linguistic realization is different. Mentions of enti- 
ties1 engaged in a social event are often quite distant 
from each other in the sentence (unlike in ACE rela- 
tions where about 70% of relations are local, in our 
social event annotation, only 25% of the events are 
local. In fact, the average number of words between 
entities participating in any social event is 9.)
  We use tree kernel methods (on structures derived 
from phrase structure trees and dependency trees) in 
conjunction with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) 
to solve our tasks.  For the design of structures and 
type of kernel, we take motivation  from a system 
proposed by Nguyen et al. (2009) which is a state- 
of-the-art system for relation extraction. Data skew- 
ness turns out to be a big challenge for the task of 
relation  detection since there are many more pairs 
of entities without  a relation as compared to pairs of 
entities that have a relation. In this paper we dis- 
cuss three data sampling  techniques that deal with 
this skewness and allow us to gain over 20% in F1- 
measure over our baseline system. Moreover, we 
introduce  a new sequence kernel  that outperforms 
previously proposed sequence kernels for the task of 
social event detection and plays a role to achieve the 
best performing  system for the task of social event 
detection and classification.
  The paper is structured  as follows. In Section 2, 
we compare our work to existing work, notably the 
ACE extraction literature. In Section 3, we present 
our task in detail, and explain how we annotated our 
corpus. We also show why this is a novel task, and 
how it is different from the ACE extraction  tasks. 
We then discuss kernel methods and the structures 
we use, and introduce our new structure in Section 4. 
In Section 5, we present the sampling methods used 
for experiments. In Section 6 we present our exper-

we use entities and people interchangeably  since the only enti- 
ties we are interested in are people or groups of people.


iments and results for social event detection and so- 
cial event classification tasks. We conclude in Sec- 
tion 7 and mention our future direction of research.

2   Literature Survey

There has not been much work in developing tech- 
niques for ACE event  extraction   as compared  to 
ACE relation extraction.  The most salient work for 
event extraction is Grishman et al. (2005) and Ji and 
Grishman (2008). To solve the task for event ex- 
traction,  Grishman et al. (2005) mainly  use a combi- 
nation of pattern matching and statistical modeling 
techniques. They extract two kinds of patterns: 1) 
the sequence of constituent  heads separating anchor 
and its arguments and 2) a predicate argument sub- 
graph of the sentence connecting anchor to all the 
event arguments.  In conjunction they use a set of 
Maximum  Entropy based classifiers for 1) Trigger 
labeling, 2) Argument classification and 3) Event 
classification.  Ji and Grishman (2008) further ex- 
ploit a correlation  between senses of verbs (that are 
triggers for events) and topics of documents.
  Our work shares some similarities.  However, in- 
stead of building  different  classifiers, we use kernel 
methods with SVMs that “naturally” combine vari- 
ous patterns. The structures we use for kernel meth- 
ods are a super-set of the patterns used by Grishman 
et al. (2005). Moreover, in our work, we take gold 
annotation for entity mentions, and do not deal with 
the task of named entity detection or resolution. Fi- 
nally, our social  events are a broad  class of event 
types, and they involve linguistic expressions for ex- 
pressing interactions and cognition that do not seem 
to have a correlation  with the topics of documents.
  There has been much work in extracting ACE re- 
lations. The supervised approaches used for relation 
extraction can broadly be divided into three main 
categories:  1) feature-based approaches 2) kernel- 
based approaches and 3) a combination  of feature 
and kernel  based approaches.   The state-of-the-art 
feature  based approach  is that of GuoDong et al. 
(2005). They use diverse lexical, syntactic  and se- 
mantic knowledge for the task.  The lexical fea- 
tures they use are words  between, before,  and af- 
ter target entity mentions, the type of entity (Per- 
son, Organization etc.), the type of mention (named, 
nominal or pronominal)  and a feature called overlap


that counts the number of other entity mentions and 
words between the target entities. To incorporate 
syntactic features they use features extracted  from 
base phrase chunking,  dependency trees and phrase 
structure trees. To incorporate  semantic features, 
their approach uses resources like a country  list and 
WordNet. GuoDong et al. (2005) report that 70% of 
the entities are embedded within each other or sep- 
arated by just one word. This is a major  difference 
to our task because most of our relations span over a 
long distance in a sentence.
  Collins and Duffy (2002) are among the earliest 
researchers to propose the use of tree kernels for 
various NLP tasks. Since then kernels have been 
used for the task of relation extraction (Zelenko et 
al., 2002; Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Zhang et al.,
2006; Moschitti, 2006b; Nguyen et al., 2009). For 
an excellent review of these techniques,  see Nguyen 
et al. (2009). In addition,  there has been some work 
that combines  feature  and kernel based methods 
(Harabagiu et al., 2005; Culotta and Jeffrey, 2004; 
Zhou et al., 2007). Apart from using kernels over de- 
pendency trees, Culotta and Jeffrey (2004) incorpo- 
rate features like words, part of speech (POS) tags, 
syntactic chunk tag, entity type, entity level, rela- 
tion argument and WordNet hypernym.  Harabagiu 
et al. (2005) leverage this approach by adding more 
semantic feature derived from semantic parsers for 
FrameNet and PropBank.  Zhou et al. (2007)  use a 
context sensitive kernel in conjunction with features 
they used in their earlier publication (GuoDong et 
al., 2005). However, we take an approach similar 
to Nguyen et al. (2009). This is because it incorpo- 
rates many of the features suggested in feature-based 
approaches by using combinations of various struc- 
tures derived from phrase structure trees and depen- 
dency trees. In addition we use data sampling tech- 
niques to deal with the problem of data skewness. 
We not only try the structures suggested by Nguyen 
et al. (2009) but also introduce  a new sequence struc- 
ture on dependency trees. We discuss their struc- 
tures and kernel method in detail in Section 4.

3   Social Event Annotation Data

3.1   Social Event Annotation


notably the ACE effort (Doddington et al., 2004). 
We leverage this work by annotating social events on 
the English part of ACE 2005 Multilingual Training 
Data2  that has already  been annotated for entities, 
relations and events. In Agarwal et al. (2010), we in- 
troduce a comprehensive  set of social events which 
are conceptually  different from the event annotation 
that already exists for ACE. Since our annotation 
task is complex and layered, in Agarwal et al. (2010) 
we present confusion matrices, Cohen’s Kappa, and 
F-measure values for each of the decision points that 
the annotators go through in the process of select- 
ing a type and subtype for an event.  Our annota- 
tion scheme is reliable,  achieving a moderate kappa 
for relation detection (0.68) and a high kappa for re- 
lation classification (0.86). We also achieve a high 
global agreement of 69.7% using a measure which 
is inspired by Automated Content Extraction (ACE) 
inter-annotator  agreement measure. This compares 
favorably to the ACE annotation effort.
  Following are the two broad types of social events 
that were annotated:
  Interaction event (INR): When both entities par- 
ticipating in an event are aware of each other and of 
the social event, we say they have an INR relation. 
Consider the following Example (1).

(1) [Toujan  Faisal],   54,   {said}    [she]  was
{informed}  of  the refusal by  an [Interior 
Ministry   committee] overseeing election 
preparations.                                       INR

  As is intuitive, if one person informs  the other 
about something, both have to be cognizant of each 
other and of the informing  event in which they are 
both participating.
  Observation event (OBS): When only one person 
(out of the two people that are participating  in an 
event) is aware of the other and of the social event, 
we say they have an OBS relation.  Of the type OBS, 
there are three subtypes: Physical Proximity  (PPR), 
Perception (PCR) and Cognition  (COG).  PPR re- 
quires that one entity can observe the other entity in 
real time not through a broadcast medium,  in con- 
trast to the subtype PCR, where one entity observes 
the other through media (TV, radio, magazines etc.) 
Any other observation event that is not PPR or PCR


There has been much work in the past on annotat-	 	


ing entities,  relations and events in free text, most


2 Version: 6.0, Catalog number: LDC2005E18


is COG. Consider the aforementioned Example (1). 
In this sentence, the event said marks  a COG re- 
lation between Toujan  Faisal and the committee. 
This is because, when one person talks about another 
person, the other person must be present in the first 
person’s cognitive  state without  any requirement on 
physical proximity or external medium.
  As the annotations revealed, PPR and PCR oc- 
curred only twice and once, respectively, in the part 
of ACE corpus we annotated. (They occur more fre- 
quently in another genre we are investigating  such 
as  literary texts.)  We omit these extremely  low- 
frequency categories from our current study; in this 
paper we build classifiers to detect and classify only 
INR and COG events.

3.2   Comparison Between Social Events and
ACE Annotations

The ACE effort is about entity, relation  and event 
annotation.  We use their annotations for entity types 
PER.Individual  and PER.Group and add our social 
event annotations.   Our event annotations  are dif- 
ferent from ACE event annotations because we an- 
notate text that expresses the cognitive  states of the 
people involved, or allows the annotator to infer it. 
Therefore, at the top level of classification we dif- 
ferentiate between events in which only one entity 
is cognizant of the other (observation) versus events 
when both entities are cognizant of each other (in- 
teraction).  This distinction is, we believe, novel in 
event or relation annotation.
  Now we present statistics and examples to make 
clear how our annotations are different  from ACE 
event annotations.   The statistics  are based on 62 
documents from the ACE corpus. These files con- 
tain a total of 212 social events. We found a total of
63 candidate ACE events that had at least two Person 
entities involved. Out of these 63 candidate events,
54 match our annotations.  The majority of social 
events that match the ACE events are of type INR. 
On analysis, we found that most of these correspond 
to the ACE event type CONTACT. Specifically, the 
“meeting” event, which is an ACE CONTACT event 
and an INR event according to our definition, is the 
major cause of overlap. However, our type INR has 
a broader definition  than ACE type CONTACT. For 
example, in Example 1, we recorded an INR event 
between Toujan Faisal and committee (event span:


informed). ACE does not record any event between 
these two entities because informed  does not entail 
a CONTACT event for ACE event annotations.  An- 
other example that will clarify the difference is the 
following:

(2) In central Baghdad, [a Reuters cameraman] and 
[a cameraman for Spain’s Telecinco] died when 
an American tank fired on the Palestine Hotel

  ACE has annotated the above example  as an event 
of type CONFLICT in which there are two entities 
that are of type person:  the Reuters cameraman 
and the cameraman for Spain’s Telecinco, both of 
which are arguments  of type “Victim”.   Being an 
event that has two person entities  involved makes 
the above sentence a potential  social event.  How- 
ever, we do not record any event between these enti- 
ties since the text does not reveal the cognitive  states 
of the two entities; we do not know whether one was 
aware of the other.
  ACE defines  a class  of social relations (PER- 
SOC) that records named relations like friendship, 
co-worker, long lasting etc. Also, there already exist 
systems that detect and classify these relations well. 
Therefore,  even though  these relations  are directly 
relevant to our overall goal of social event extrac- 
tion, we do not annotate, detect or classify these re- 
lations in this paper.

4   Tree Kernels, Discrete Structures, and
Language

In this section, we give details of the structures and 
kernel we use for our classification tasks. We also 
discuss our motivation  behind using these methods. 
Linear learning machines are one of the most popu- 
lar machines used for classification problems.  The 
objective of a  typical classification problem is to 
learn a function  that separates the data into differ- 
ent classes. The data is usually in the form of fea- 
tures extracted  from abstract objects  like  strings, 
trees, etc. A drawback of learning by using com- 
plex functions is that complex functions do not gen- 
eralize well and thus tend to over-fit. The research 
community  therefore prefers linear classifiers over 
other complex classifiers. But more often than not, 
the data is not linearly separable.  It can be made 
linearly separable by increasing the dimensionality 
of data but then learning suffers from the curse of


dimensionality and classification  becomes computa- 
tionally intractable.  This is where kernels come to 
the rescue. The well-known  kernel trick aids us in 
finding similarity between feature vectors in a high 
dimensional  space without having to write down the 
expanded feature space. The essence of kernel meth- 
ods is that they compare two feature vectors in high 
dimensional  space by using a dot product that is a

function of the dot product of feature vectors in the 
lower dimensional  space.  Moreover,  Convolution 
Kernels (first introduced by Haussler (1999)) can 
be used to compare abstract objects instead of fea- 
ture vectors. This is because these kernels  involve 
a recursive calculation  over the “parts” of a discrete 
structure. This calculation  is usually made computa- 
tionally efficient using Dynamic Programming tech- 
niques. Therefore, Convolution Kernels alleviate the 
need of feature extraction (which usually requires 
domain knowledge, results in extraction of incom- 
plete information  and introduces noise in the data). 
Therefore, we use convolution  kernels with a linear

learning machine (Support Vector Machines) for our 
classification task.
  Now we present the “discrete”  structures followed 
by the kernel we used. We use the structures pre- 
viously used by Nguyen et al. (2009), and propose 
one new structure. Although we experimented with 
all of their structures,3 here we only present the ones 
that perform best for our classification task. All the 
structures and their combinations are derived from a 
variation of the underlying  structures, Phrase Struc- 
ture Trees (PST) and Dependency Trees (DT). For 
all trees we first extract their Path Enclosed Tree, 
which is the smallest common subtree that contains 
the two target entities (Moschitti,  2004). We use the 
Stanford  parser (Klein and Manning,  2003) to get 
the basic PSTs and DTs. Following are the struc- 
tures that we refer to in our experiments and results 
section:
PET: This refers to the smallest common  phrase 
structure tree that contains the two target entities. 
Dependency Words (DW) tree: This is the smallest 
common dependency tree that contains the two tar- 
get entities. In Figure 1, since the target entities are 
at the leftmost and rightmost  branch of the depen-

  3 We omitted SK6, which is the worst performing  sequence 
kernel in (Nguyen et al., 2009).


Figure 1: Dependency parse tree for the sentence 
(in the ACE corpus): “[Toujan Faisal], 54, {said} 
[she] was {informed} of the refusal by an 
[Interior Min- istry committee] overseeing 
election preparations.”


dency tree, this is in fact a DW (ignoring the 
gram- matical relations on the arcs).
Grammatical Relation (GR) tree: If we replace 
the words at the nodes by their relation to their 
corre- sponding parent in DW, we get a GR tree. 
For exam- ple, in Figure 1, replacing Toujan 
Faisal by nsubj,
54 by appos, she by nsubjpass and so on. 
Grammatical Relation Word (GRW) tree:	We  
get this tree by adding the grammatical  relations 
as sep- arate nodes between a node and its parent.  
For ex- ample, in Figure 1, adding nsubj as a 
node between T1-Individual  and Toujan Faisal, 
appos as a node between 54 and Toujan  Faisal, 
and so on.
Sequence Kernel of words (SK1):  This is the 
se- quence of words between the two entities, 
including their tags. For our example in Figure 
1, it would be T1-Individual  Toujan Faisal 54 
said she was in- formed of the refusal by an T2-
Group Interior Min- istry committee.
Sequence in GRW tree (SqGRW): This is the 
new structure that we introduce which, to the 
best of


our knowledge,  has not been used before  for sim- 
ilar tasks. It is the sequence of nodes from one 
target to the other in the GRW tree. For example, 
in Figure 1, this would be Toujan  Faisal nsubj T1- 
Individual said ccomp informed prep by T2-Group 
pobj committee.
  We  also use  combinations   of these structures 
(which we refer to as “combined-structures”).   For 
example, PET GR SqGRW means we used the three 
structures (PET, GR and SqGRW)  together with a 
kernel that calculates similarity  between forests.
  We use the Partial Tree (PT) kernel, first proposed 
by Moschitti (2006a), for structures derived from de- 
pendency trees and Subset Tree (SST) kernel,  pro- 
posed by Collins and Duffy (2002), for structures 
derived from phrase structure trees. PT is a relaxed 
version of the SST; SST measures the similarity be- 
tween two PSTs by counting all subtrees common to 
the two PSTs. However, there is one constraint:  all 
daughter nodes of a node must be included.  In PTs 
this constraint is removed. Therefore, in contrast 
to SSTs, PT kernels compare many more substruc- 
tures. They have been used successfully  by (Mos- 
chitti, 2004) for the task of semantic role labeling.
  The choices  we have  made are  motivated   by 
the following considerations. We  are interested 
in modeling classes  of events  which are charac- 
terized by the cognitive  states of participants–who 
is aware of whom. The predicate-argument struc- 
ture of verbs can encode much of this information 
very efficiently, and classes of verbs express their 
predicate-argument structure in similar ways. For 
example,  many verbs of communication can ex- 
press their arguments using the same pattern:  John 
talked/spoke/lectured/ranted/testified to Mary about 
Percy. Independently of the verb, John is in a COG 
relation with Percy and in an INR relation with 
Mary.  All these verbs allow us to drop either or 
both of the prepositional  phrases, without altering 
the interpretation of the remaining constituents. And 
even more strikingly, any verb that can be put in that 
position is likely to have this interpretation; for ex- 
ample, we are likely to interpret the neologistic John 
gazooked to Mary about Percy as a similarly struc- 
tured social event.
  The regular relation between verb alternations and 
meaning components has been extensively  studied 
(Levin, 1993; Schuler,  2005).  This regularity in


the syntactic predicate-argument structure allows us 
to overcome lexical sparseness.  However,  in or- 
der to exploit such regularities, we need to have ac- 
cess to a representation which  makes the predicate- 
argument structure clear. Dependency representa- 
tions do this. Phrase structure representations also 
represent predicate-argument structure, but in an in- 
direct way through the structural configurations, and 
we expect this to increase the burden on the learner. 
(In some phrase structure representations, some ar- 
guments and adjuncts are not disambiguated.)  When 
using dependency structures, the SST kernel is far 
less appealing, since it forces us to always consider 
all daughter nodes of a node.  However,  as we have 
seen, it is certain daughter nodes, such as the pres- 
ence of a to PP and a about PP, which are important, 
while other daughters, such as temporal  or locative 
adjuncts, should be disregarded.  The PT kernel al- 
lows us to do this.

5   Sampling Methods

In this section we present the data sampling  meth- 
ods we use to deal with data skewness.   We  em- 
ploy two well-known data sampling methods on the 
training  data before creating a model for test data; 
random under-sampling and random over-sampling 
(Kotsiantis et al., 2006; Japkowicz, 2000; Weiss and 
Provost, 2001). These techniques are non-heuristic 
sampling  methods that aim at balancing the class 
proportions by removing  examples of the major- 
ity class and by duplicating instances of the minor- 
ity class respectively. The reason for using  these 
techniques is that learning is usually optimized to 
achieve high accuracy.  Therefore,  when presented 
with skewed training  data, a classifier may learn the 
target concept with a high accuracy by only predict- 
ing the majority  class. But if one looks at the preci- 
sion, recall, and F-measure, of such a classifier,  they 
will be very low for the minority class.  Since, like 
other researchers, we are evaluating  the goodness of 
a model based on its precision,  recall and F-measure 
and not on the accuracy on the test set, either  we 
should change the optimization  function  of the clas- 
sifier or employ data sampling techniques. We em- 
ploy the latter because by balancing the class ratio, 
we are presenting  the classifier with a more  chal- 
lenging task of achieving a good accuracy when the


majority base class is about 50%. The major draw- 
backs of the two techniques is that under-sampling 
throws away important information  whereas over- 
sampling is prone to over-fitting (due to data dupli- 
cation). As our results show, throwing  away infor- 
mation about the majority  class is much better than 
the system that tries to learn in an unbalanced sce- 
nario, but it performs worse than an approach using 
data duplication. Since we are using SVMs as a clas- 
sifier, over-fitting is unlikely as reported by Kolcz et 
al. (2003).
  In order to be sure that we are not over-fitting, 
we tried another sampling method proposed by Ha 
and Bunke (1997), which is shown to be good so- 
lution to avoid over-fitting by Chawla et al. (2002). 
This sampling technique proposes to generate syn- 
thetic examples of the minority class by “perturb- 
ing” the training data. Specifically, Ha and Bunke 
(1997) produced new synthetic examples for the task 
of handwritten character recognition by doing op- 
erations like rotation and skew on characters.  The 
basic idea is to produce synthetic examples that are 
“close” to the real example from which these syn- 
thetic points are generated.  Analogously,  we tried 
two transformations on our dependency tree struc- 
tures to produce synthetic examples. The first trans- 
formation is based on the observation that in con- 
trol verb constructions,  the matrix verb typically 
does not contribute to the interpretation  as a social 
event or not. In this transformation, we lower the 
subject to an argument verb if it does not have  a 
subject, and repeat this procedure iteratively.  As 
it turned out, this transformation only occurred 15 
times, and therefore it does not serve the purpose 
of over-sampling.   We tried a more relaxed trans- 
formation on the rightmost target in the tree. Here, 
the observation is that for the COG social events, 
the second target may be very deeply embedded in 
the tree. For example, in Example 1, Toujan Faisal 
and the Interior Ministry Committee participate in a 
COG event (because Faisal is aware of the Commit- 
tee during the saying event). However, the contents 
of what Faisal said is only relevant to the extent that 
it pertains to the committee.  The depth of the em- 
bedding of the second target creates issues of data 
sparseness, as the path-enclosed  trees become very


node, attaching it on the left, and to recalculate the 
path-enclosed tree, which is now smaller. This is re- 
peated iteratively,  so that a sentence with a deeply 
embedded second target can yield a large number of 
synthesized structures.

6   Experiments And Results

In this section we present experiments and results for 
our two tasks: social event detection and classifica- 
tion. For the social event detection task, we wish to 
validate the following research hypotheses. First, we 
aim to show the importance of using data sampling 
when evaluating on F-measure; specifically,  we ex- 
pect under-sampling  to outperform  no sampling, 
over-sampling to outperform  under-sampling, and 
over-sampling with transformations to out perform 
over-sampling without transformations. In contrast, 
the social event classification  task does not suffer 
from  data skewness because the INR and COG rela- 
tions; both occur almost the same number of times. 
Therefore, sampling methods may not be applied for 
this task. Second, for both tasks, we expect that a 
combination of kernels will out-perform individual 
kernels. Moreover, we expect that dependency trees 
will have a crucial role in achieving the best perfor- 
mance.

6.1   Experimental Set-up

We use part of ACE data that we annotated for social 
events.  In all, we annotated 138 ACE documents. 
We retained the ACE entity annotations.  We con- 
sider all entity mention pairs in a sentence.   If our 
annotators recorded a relation between a pair of en- 
tity mentions, we say there is a relation between the 
corresponding entities. If there are any other pairs of 
entity mentions for the same pair of entity, we dis- 
card those. For all other pairs of entity mentions, 
we say there is no relation. Out of 138 files, four 
files did not have any positive or negative examples 
(because there were very few and sparse entity men- 
tions in these four files). We found a total of 1291 
negative examples, 172 examples belonging to class 
INR and 174 belonging to class COG.
We use Jet’s sentence splitter4 and the Stanford
Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) for phrase struc- 
ture trees and dependency  parses.   For classifica-


large and very diverse.  Our transformation, there-	 	


fore, is to move the second target to its grandmother

tion, we used Alessandro  Moschitti’s SVM-Light- 
TK package (Moschitti, 2006b) which is built on 
the SVM-Light implementation of Joakhims (1999). 
For all our experiments, we perform 5-fold cross- 
validation. We randomly divide the whole corpus 
into 5 equal parts, such that no news story (or docu- 
ment) gets divided among two parts. For each fold, 
we then merge 4 parts to create a training corpus and 
treat the remaining  part as a test corpus.  By keep- 
ing individual news stories intact, we make sure that 
vocabulary specific to one story does not unrealisti- 
cally improve the performance.

6.2   Social Event Detection
Social event detection is the task of detecting if any 
social event exists between a pair of entities in a sen- 
tence. We formulate  the problem as a binary classi- 
fication task by labeling an example that does not 
have a social event as class -1 and by labeling  an ex- 
ample that either has an INR or COG social event 
as class 1. First we present results for our baseline 
system. Our baseline system uses various structures 
and their combinations but without any data balanc- 
ing. 5

Table 1: Baseline System for the task of social event 
detection. The proportion of positive data in training 
and test set is 21.1% and 20.6% respectively.

  Table 1 presents results for our baseline system. 
Grammatical relation tree structure (GR), a struc- 
ture derived from dependency tree by replacing the 
words by their grammatical  relations achieves the 
best precision. This is probably  because the clas-

  5 Although we experimented with many more structures and 
their combinations,  due to space restrictions  we mention only 
the top results.


sifier learns that if both the arguments of a predi- 
cate contain target entities then it is a social  event. 
Among kernels for single structures, the path en- 
closed  tree for PSTs (PET) achieves  the best re- 
call. Furthermore,  a combination  of structures de- 
rived from PSTs and DTs performs best. The se- 
quence kernels, perform much worse than SqGRW 
(F1-measure  as low as 0.45). Since it is the same 
case for all subsequent experiments,  we omit them 
from the discussion.

Table 2: Under-sampled system for the task of rela- 
tion detection. The proportion of positive examples 
in the training  and test corpus is 50.0% and 20.6% 
respectively.


  We now turn to experiments involving sampling. 
Table 2 presents results for under-sampling, i.e. ran- 
domly removing examples belonging to the negative 
class until its size matches the positive class. Table 2 
shows  a large  gain in F1-measure of 9.72% abso- 
lute over the baseline system (Table 1). We found 
that worst performing kernel with under-sampling 
is SK1 with an F1-measure  of 39.2% which is 
better than the best performance  without under- 
sampling. These results make it clear that doing 
under-sampling greatly improves the performance of 
the classifier, despite the fact that we are using less 
training data (fewer negative examples). This is as 
expected because we are evaluating  on F1-measure 
and the classifier is optimizing for accuracy.
  Table 3 presents results  for over-sampling  i.e. 
replicating  positive  examples to achieve an equal 
number of examples belonging  to the positive and 
negative class. Table 3 shows that the gain over 
the baseline system now is 22.2% absolute.  Also, 
the gain over the under-sampled  system is 12.5%

tion detection. The proportion of positive examples 
in the training  and test corpus is 50.0% and 20.6% 
respectively.



absolute. As in the baseline system, a combina- 
tion of structures performs best. As in the under- 
sampled system, when the data is balanced, SqGRW 
(sequence kernel on dependency tree in which gram- 
matical relations are inserted as intermediate nodes) 
achieves the best recall. Here, the PET and GR ker- 
nel perform similar: this is different from the results 
of (Nguyen et al., 2009) where GR performed much 
worse than PET for ACE data. This exemplifies 
the difference in the nature of our event annotations 
from that of ACE relations.  Since the average dis- 
tance between target entities in the surface word or- 
der is higher for our events, the phrase structure trees 
are bigger. This means that implicit feature space is 
much sparser and thus not the best representation.



  Table 4  presents  results for  using the over- 
sampling method with transformation that produces 
synthetic positive examples by using a transforma- 
tion on dependency  trees such  that the new syn- 
thetic examples  are “close” to the original exam- 
ples. This method achieves a gain 16.78% over the 
baseline system. We expected this system to per- 
form better than the over-sampled system but it does 
not. This suggests that our over-sampled system is 
not over-fitting;  a concern with using oversampling 
techniques.

6.3   Social Event Classification
For the social event classification task, we only con- 
sider pairs of entities that have an event. Since these 
events could only be INR or COG, this is a binary 
classification problem.  However, now we are inter- 
ested in both outcomes of the classification, while 
earlier we were only interested in knowing how well 
we were finding relations (and not in how well we 
were finding “non-relations”).  Therefore, accuracy 
is the relevant metric (Table 5).




Table 5: System for the task of relation classifica- 
tion.  The two classes are INR and COG,  and we 
evaluate using accuracy (Acc.). The proportion of 
INR relations in training  and test set is 49.7% and
49.63% respectively.









Table 4: Over-sampled System with transformation 
for relation detection. The proportion of positive ex- 
amples in the training  and test corpus is 51.7% and
20.6% respectively.
  

Even though the task of reasoning if  an event 
is about one-way or mutual cognition  seems hard, 
our system  beats the chance baseline by 28.72%. 
These results show that there are significant  clues 
in the lexical and syntactic  structures that help in 
differentiating between interaction and cognition so- 
cial events.  Once again we notice that the combi- 
nation of kernels works better than single kernels


alone, though the difference  here is less pronounced. 
Among the combined-structure   approaches, com- 
binations with dependency-derived  structures con- 
tinue to outperform those not including  dependency 
(the best all-phrase structure performer is PET SK1 
with 75.7% accuracy, not shown in Table 5).

7   Conclusion And Future Work

In this paper, we have introduced the novel tasks of 
social event detection and classification.   We show 
that data sampling  techniques play a  crucial role 
for the task of relation detection. Through over- 
sampling we achieve an increase in F1-measure of
22.2% absolute over a baseline system.  Our exper- 
iments show that as a result  of how language ex- 
presses the relevant information,  dependency-based 
structures are best suited for encoding this informa- 
tion.  Furthermore,   because of the complexity of 
the task, a combination  of phrase based structures 
and dependency-based structures perform  the best. 
This revalidates  the observation of Nguyen et al. 
(2009) that phrase structure representations and de- 
pendency representations add complimentary  value 
to the learning task. We also introduced  a new se- 
quence structure (SqGRW)  which plays a  role in 
achieving the best accuracy for both, social event de- 
tection and social event classification tasks.
  In the future, we will use other parsers (such as 
semantic parsers) and explore new types of linguis- 
tically motivated structures and transformations. We 
will also investigate the relation  between classes of 
social events and their syntactic realization.
