Abstract

Relation extraction is a challenging task in 
natural language processing. Syntactic 
features are recently shown to be quite 
effective for relation extraction. In this 
paper, we generalize the state of the art 
syntactic  convolution  tree  kernel 
introduced by Collins and Duffy. The 
proposed  generalized  kernel  is  more 
flexible and customizable, and can be 
conveniently utilized for systematic 
generation of more effective application 
specific syntactic sub-kernels. Using the 
generalized kernel, we will also propose a 
number of novel syntactic sub-kernels for 
relation extraction. These kernels show a 
remarkable performance improvement over
the original Collins and Duffy kernel in the


"airport" and also between "police" and 
"airport" that can be shown in the following 
format.

1     Introduction

One of the contemporary demanding NLP tasks is 
information extraction, which is the procedure of 
extracting structured information such as entities, 
relations, and events from free text documents. As 
an information extraction sub-task, semantic 
relation extraction is the procedure of finding 
predefined   semantic   relations   between   textual 
entity mentions. For instance, assuming a semantic 
relation with type Physical and subtype Located 
between  an  entity  of  type  Person  and  another 
entity of type Location, the sentence "Police 
arrested  Mark at the airport  last week." conveys 
two mentions of this relation between "Mark" and


Kernel functions can implicitly capture a large 
amount of features efficiently; thus, they have been 
widely used in various NLP tasks.
  Various types of features have been exploited so 
far   for   relation   extraction.   In   (Bunescu   and
Mooney, 2005b) sequence of  words features are
utilized using a sub-sequence kernel. In (Bunescu 
and  Mooney,  2005a)  dependency graph  features 
are exploited, and in (Zhang et al., 2006a) syntactic 
features are employed for relation extraction. 
Although in order to achieve the best performance, 
it is necessary to use a proper combination of these 
features (Zhou et al., 2005), in this paper, we will 
concentrate on how to better capture the syntactic 
features for relation extraction.

  In CD’01 (Collins and Duffy, 2001) a 
convolution syntactic tree kernel is proposed that 
generally  measures  the  syntactic  similarity 
between parse trees. In this paper, a generalized 
version of CD’01 convolution tree kernel is 
proposed by associating generic weights to the 
nodes  and  sub-trees  of  the  parse  tree.  These 
weights can be used to incorporate domain 
knowledge  into  the  kernel  and  make  it  more 
flexible and customizable. The generalized kernel 
can be conveniently used to generate a variety of 
syntactic sub-kernels (including the original CD’01 
kernel), by adopting appropriate weighting 
mechanisms.
As a result, in this paper, novel syntactic sub-


finally  found  to  be  the  best  performing  tree 
portion.  PT  is  a  portion  of  parse  tree  that  is 
enclosed by the shortest path between the two 
relation arguments. Moreover, this tree kernel is 
combined   with   an   entity   kernel   to   form   a 
reportedly high quality composite kernel in (Zhang 
et al., 2006b).

3     CD’01 Convolution Tree Kernel

In (Collins and Duffy, 2001), a convolution tree 
kernel has been introduced that measures the 
syntactic   similarity   between   parse   trees.   This 
kernel  computes  the  inner  products  of  the 
following feature vector.


kernels are generated from the generalized kernel 
for  the  task  of  relation  extraction.  Evaluations

  The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  structured  as 
follows. In section 2, the most related works are
briefly reviewed. In section 3, CD’01 tree kernel is
described. The proposed generalized convolution 
tree  kernel  is  explained  in  section  4  and  its
produced  sub-kernels  for  relation  extraction  are


Each feature of this vector is the occurrence count 
of  a  sub-tree  type  in  the  parse  tree  decayed
exponentially by the parameter  λ  .  Without this
decaying  mechanism  used  to  retain  the  kernel
values within a fairly small range, the value of the 
kernel for identical trees becomes far higher than


illustrated in section 5. The experimental results
are discussed in section 6. Our work is concluded


its value for different trees. Term


sizei   is defined


in section 7 and some possible future works are 
presented in section 8.

2     Related Work

In (Collins and Duffy, 2001), a convolution parse 
tree kernel has been introduced. This kernel is 
generally designed to measure syntactic similarity


to be the number of rules or internal nodes of the ith
sub-tree type. Samples of such sub-trees are shown 
in Fig. 1 for a simple parse tree. Since the number 
of sub-trees of a tree is exponential in its size 
(Collins and Duffy, 2001), direct inner product 
calculation is computationally infeasible. 
Consequently, Collins and Duffy (2001) proposed 
an   ingenious   kernel   function   that   implicitly


between parse trees and is especially exploited for 
parsing  English  sentences  in  their  paper.  Since

et  al., 2006a;  Zhang  et  al.,  2006b; Zhou et  al.,
2007; Li et al. 2008).
  For the first time, in (Zhang et al., 2006a), this 
convolution  tree  kernel  was  used  for  relation
extraction. Since the whole syntactic parse tree of 
the  sentence  that  holds  the  relation  arguments

  Since each node of the whole syntactic tree can 
either happen as an internal node or as an external 
node of a supposed sub-tree (presuming its 
existence in the sub-tree), two types of weights are 
respectively   associated   to   each   node   by   the


different  production  rules  they  can't  
accordingly

there is exactly one common sub-tree of size 
two.
It should be noted that all the leaf nodes of the 
tree
(or words of the sentence) are considered identical 
in the calculation of the tree kernel. The value 
of the function in this case is the weight of this

the existence of common sub-trees rooted at n1

trees rooted at their corresponding children, 
which can be combined multiplicatively to form 
their parents' common sub-trees.

In this section, three sub-kernels of the generalized

relation extraction. Using the embedded weights of

This kernel is intuitively similar to the previous

Table 1: The F1-Measure value is shown for every kernel on each ACE-2005 main relation type. For every relation 
type the best result is shown in bold font.



  We have used LIBSVM (Chang and Lin 2001) 
java   source   for   the   SVM   classification   and 
Stanford NLP package1  for tokenization, sentence 
segmentation and parsing.
  Following [Bunescu and Mooney, 2007], every 
pair of entities within a sentence is regarded as a 
negative relation instance unless it is annotated as a 
positive relation in the corpus. The total number of 
negative  training  instances,  constructed  in  this 
way, is about 20 times more than the number of 
annotated  positive  instances.  Thus,  we  also 
imposed the restriction of maximum argument 
distance  of  10 words. This constraint  eliminates 
half of the negative constructed instances while 
slightly decreases positive instances. Nevertheless, 
since the resulted training set is still unbalanced, 
we  used  LIBSVM  weighting  mechanism. 
Precisely, if there are P  positive and N negative
instances  in  the  training  set,  a  weight  value  of


except for AAP are computed on the PT portion 
described in section 2. AAP is computed over the 
MCT  tree  portion  which  is  also  proposed  by 
(Zhang et al., 2006a) and is the sub-tree rooted at 
the first common ancestor of relation arguments.
For the proposed kernels α   is set to 0.44 which
is tuned on a development set that contained 5000 
instances  of  type  PHYS.  The  λ      parameter  of
CD’01 kernel is set to 0.4 according to (Zhang et 
al., 2006a). The C parameter of SVM classification 
is set to 2.4 for all the kernels after tuning it 
individually for each kernel on the mentioned 
development set.

6.2  Experiments Results

The results of the experiments are shown in Table
1. The proposed kernels outperform the original
CD’01 kernel in four of the six relation types. The

  A binary SVM is trained for every relation type 
separately,  and  type  compatible  annotated  and
constructed relation instances are used to train it.
For  each  relation  type,  only  type  compatible 
relation instances are exploited for training. For 
example to learn an ORG-AFF relation (which 
applies to (PER, ORG) or (ORG, ORG) argument 
types) it is meaningless to use a relation instance 
between two entities of type PERSON. Moreover, 
the total number of training instances used for 
training every relation type is restricted to 5000 
instances to shorten the duration of the evaluation 
process. The reported results are achieved using a
5-fold cross validation method.

CD’01  convolution  tree  kernel.  All  the  kernels

remarkable because it is the best kernel in ORG-
AFF and PER-SOC relations. It particularly 
performs very well in the extraction of PER-SOC
relation with an F1-measure of 0.73. It should be 
noted that the general low performance of all the 
kernels on the GEN-AFF type is because of its 
extremely small number of annotated instances in 
the training set (40 in 5000). The AAPD kernel has 
the best performance with a remarkable 
improvement over the Collins kernel in GEN-AFF 
relation type.
  The results clearly demonstrate that the nodes 
closer to the ancestor path of relation arguments
contain the most useful syntactic features for 
relation extraction

7     Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a generalized 
convolution tree kernel that can generate various 
syntactic sub-kernels including the CD’01 kernel.


The kernel is generalized by assigning weights to 
the  sub-trees.  The  weight  of  a  sub-tree  is  the 
product of the weights assigned to its nodes by two 
types of weighting functions. In this way, impacts 
of the tree nodes on the kernel value can be 
discriminated purposely based on the application. 
Context information can also be injected to the 
kernel via context sensitive weighting mechanisms.
  Using   the   generalized   kernel,   various   sub- 
kernels can be produced by different definitions of
the  two  weighting  functions.  We  consequently
used the generalized kernel for systematic 
generation of useful kernels in relation extraction.
In these kernels, the closer a node is to the relation
arguments ancestor paths, the less it is decayed by 
the weighting functions. Evaluation on the ACE-
2005 main relation types demonstrates the 
effectiveness of the proposed kernels. They show 
remarkable performance improvement over CD’01
kernel.

8     Future Work

Although the path-enclosed tree portion (PT) 
(Zhang et al., 2006a) seems to be an appropriate 
portion of the syntactic tree for relation extraction, 
it only takes into account the syntactic information 
between the relation arguments, and discards many 
useful features (before and after the arguments 
features). It seems that the generalized kernel can 
be used with larger tree portions that contain 
syntactic features before and after the arguments, 
because it can be more easily targeted to related 
features.
  Currently, the proposed weighting mechanisms 
are solely based on the location of the tree nodes in
the parse tree; however other useful information
such as labels of nodes can also be used in 
weighting.
Another   future   work   can   be   utilizing   the
generalized kernel for other applicable NLP tasks 
such as co-reference resolution.
