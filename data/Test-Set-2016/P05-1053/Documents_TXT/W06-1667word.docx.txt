Abstract

We present an unsupervised learning ap- 
proach to disambiguate various relations 
between name entities by use of various 
lexical and syntactic features from the 
contexts.  It works by calculating eigen- 
vectors of an adjacency graph’s Lapla- 
cian  to  recover  a  submanifold  of  data 
from  a  high  dimensionality  space  and 
then performing cluster number estima- 
tion on the eigenvectors.   This method 
can  address  two  difficulties encoutered 
in Hasegawa et al. (2004)’s hierarchical 
clustering:  no consideration of manifold 
structure in data, and requirement to pro- 
vide cluster number by users. Experiment 
results on ACE corpora show that this 
spectral clustering based approach outper- 
forms Hasegawa et al. (2004)’s hierarchi- 
cal clustering method and a plain k-means 
clustering method.


1   Introduction

The task of relation extraction is to identify vari- 
ous semantic relations between name entities from 
text.  Prior work on automatic relation extraction 
come in three kinds: supervised learning algorithms 
(Miller et al., 2000; Zelenko et al., 2002; Culotta 
and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al.,
2005), semi-supervised learning algorithms (Brin,
1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004), 
and unsupervised learning algorithm (Hasegawa et 
al., 2004).
  Among these methods, supervised learning is usu- 
ally more preferred when a  large amount of  la-


beled training data  is  available.    However,  it  is 
time-consuming and labor-intensive to manually tag 
a large amount of training data.   Semi-supervised 
learning methods have been put forward to mini- 
mize the corpus annotation requirement.  Most of 
semi-supervised methods employ the bootstrapping 
framework, which only need to pre-define some ini- 
tial seeds for any particular relation, and then boot- 
strap from the seeds to acquire the relation.  How- 
ever, it is often quite difficult to enumerate all class 
labels in the initial seeds and decide an “optimal” 
number of them.
  Compared with supervised and semi-supervised 
methods, Hasegawa et al. (2004)’s unsupervised ap- 
proach for relation extraction can overcome the dif- 
ficulties on requirement of a large amount of labeled 
data and enumeration of all class labels. Hasegawa 
et al. (2004)’s method is to use a hierarchical cluster- 
ing method to cluster pairs of named entities accord- 
ing to the similarity of context words intervening be- 
tween the named entities. However, the drawback of 
hierarchical clustering is that it required providing 
cluster number by users. Furthermore, clustering is 
performed in original high dimensional space, which 
may induce non-convex clusters hard to identified.
  This paper presents a novel application of spec- 
tral clustering technique to unsupervised relation ex- 
traction problem. It works by calculating eigenvec- 
tors of an adjacency graph’s Laplacian to recover a 
submanifold of data from a high dimensional space, 
and then performing cluster number estimation on 
a transformed space defined by the first few eigen- 
vectors. This method may help us find non-convex 
clusters. It also does not need to pre-define the num- 
ber of the context clusters or pre-specify the simi- 
larity threshold for the clusters as Hasegawa et al.

  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec- 
tion 2 formulates unsupervised relation extraction 
and presents how to apply the spectral clustering 
technique to resolve the task. Then section 3 reports 
experiments and results. Finally we will give a con- 
clusion about our work in section 4.

2   Unsupervised Relation Extraction
Problem

Assume that two occurrences of entity pairs with 
similar contexts, are tend to hold the same relation 
type.  Thus unsupervised relation extraction prob- 
lem can be formulated as partitioning collections of 
entity pairs into clusters according to the similarity 
of contexts, with each cluster containing only entity 
pairs labeled by the same relation type. And then, in 
each cluster, the most representative words are iden- 
tified from the contexts of entity pairs to induce the 
label of relation type.  Here, we only focus on the 
clustering subtask and do not address the relation 
type labeling subtask.
  In the next subsections we will describe our pro- 
posed method for unsupervised relation extraction, 
which includes: 1) Collect the context vectors in 
which the entity mention pairs co-occur; 2) Cluster 
these Context vectors.

2.1   Context Vector and Feature Design


Words: Words in the two entities and three context 
windows.

Entity Type: the entity type of both entity men- 
tions, which can be PERSON, ORGANIZA- 
TION, FACILITY, LOCATION and GPE.

POS features: Part-Of-Speech tags corresponding 
to all words in the two entities and three con- 
text windows.

Chunking features: This category of features are 
extracted from the chunklink representation, 
which includes:
• Chunk tag information of the two entities and 
three context windows.   The “0” tag means that 
the word is outside of any chunk. The “I-XP” tag 
means that this word is inside an XP chunk.  The 
“B-XP” by default means that the word is at the be- 
ginning of an XP chunk.
• Grammatical function  of  the  two  entities  and
three context windows. The last word in each chunk
is its head, and the function of the head is the func- 
tion of the whole chunk.  “NP-SBJ” means a NP 
chunk as the subject of the sentence.  The other 
words in a chunk that are not the head have “NO- 
FUNC” as their function.
• IOB-chains of the heads of the two entities.  So-
called IOB-chain, noting the syntactic categories of
all the constituents on the path from the root node 
to this leaf node of tree.

  We combine the above lexical and syntactic fea- 
tures with their position information in the context 
to form the context vector. Before that, we filter out


Let X = {xi}n


be the set of 
context vectors of 
oc-


low frequency 
features which 
appeared only 
once in


currences of all entity mention pairs, where xi


repre-


the entire set.


sents the context vector of the i-th occurrence, and n
is the total number of occurrences of all entity pairs.
  Each occurrence of entity mention pairs can be 
denoted as follows:

R → (Cpre, e1, Cmid, e2, Cpost) 	(1)

where e1 and e2 represents the entity mentions, and 
Cpre,Cmid,and Cpost are the contexts before, be- 
tween and after the entity pairs respectively.
  We extracted features from e1, e2, Cpre, Cmid, 
Cpost to construct context vectors, which are com- 
puted from the parse trees derived from Charniak 
Parser (Charniak, 1999) and the Chunklink script 1 
written by Sabine Buchholz from Tilburg University.

2.2   Context Clustering
Once the context vectors of entity pairs are prepared, 
we come to the second stage of our method: cluster 
these context vectors automatically.
  In recent years, spectral clustering technique has 
received more and more attention as a powerful ap- 
proach to a range of clustering problems.  Among 
the efforts on spectral clustering techniques (Weiss,
1999; Kannan et al., 2000; Shi et al., 2000; Ng et al.,
2001; Zha et al., 2001), we adopt a modified version 
(Sanguinetti et al., 2005) of the algorithm by Ng et 
al. (2001) because it can provide us model order se- 
lection capability.
  Since we do not know how many relation types 
in advance and do not have any labeled relation

s2
1.	Construct an affinity matrix by Aij  = exp(−  ij
j, 0 if i = j.  Here, sij  is the similarity between xi  and 
xj  calculated by Cosine similarity measure. and the free 
distance parameter σ2 is used to scale the weights;
2.	Normalize the affinity matrix A to create the matrix L =
D−1/2 AD−1/2 , where D is a diagonal matrix whose (i,i)
element is the sum of A’s ith row;
3.	Set q = 2;
4.	Compute q eigenvectors of L with greatest eigenvalues.
Arrange them in a matrix Y .
5.	Perform elongated K -means with q + 1 centers on Y , 
initializing the (q + 1)-th mean in the origin;
6.	If the q + 1-th cluster contains any data points, then there 
must be at least an extra cluster; set q  = q + 1 and go 
back to step 4.  Otherwise, algorithm stops and outputs
         clustered data and number of clusters.



training examples at hand, the problem of model 
order selection arises, i.e.   estimating the “opti- 
mal” number of clusters.  Formally, let k be the 
model order, we need to find k in Equation:  k = 
argmaxk {criterion(k)}.  Here, the criterion is de- 
fined on the result of spectral clustering.
  Table 1 shows the details of the whole algorithm 
for context clustering, which contains two main 
stages: 1) Transformation of Clustering Space (Step
1-4); 2) Clustering in the transformed space using
Elongated K-means algorithm (Step 5-6).

2.3   Transformation of Clustering Space

We represent each context vector of entity pair as a 
node in an undirected graph. Each edge (i,j) in the 
graph is assigned a weight that reflects the similarity 
between two context vectors i and j. Hence, the re- 
lation extraction task for entity pairs can be defined 
as a partition of the graph so that entity pairs that 
are more similar to each other, e.g.  labeled by the 
same relation type, belong to the same cluster. As a 
relaxation of such NP-hard discrete graph partition- 
ing problem, spectral clustering technique computes 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Laplacian matrix 
related to the given graph, and construct data clus- 
ters based on such spectral information.
  Thus the starting point of context clustering is to 
construct an affinity matrix A from the data, which 
is an n × n matrix encoding the distances between


the various points.  The affinity matrix is then nor- 
malized to form a matrix L by conjugating with the 
the diagonal matrix D−1/2  which has as entries the 
square roots of the sum of the rows of A. This is to 
take into account the different spread of the various 
clusters (points belonging to more rarified clusters 
will have lower sums of the corresponding row of 
A).  It is straightforward to prove that L is positive 
definite and has eigenvalues smaller or equal to 1, 
with equality holding in at least one case.
  Let K be the true number of clusters present in 
the dataset. If K is known beforehand, the first K 
eigenvectors of L will be computed and arranged as 
columns in a matrix Y . Each row of Y corresponds 
to a context vector of entity pair, and the above pro- 
cess can be considered as transforming the original 
context vectors in a d-dimensional space to new con- 
text vectors in the K -dimensional space. Therefore, 
the rows of Y will cluster upon mutually orthogonal 
points on the K dimensional sphere,rather than on 
the coordinate axes.

2.4   The Elongated K-means algorithm
As the step 5 of Table 1 shows, the result of elon- 
gated K -means algorithm is used to detect whether 
the number of clusters selected q is less than the true 
number K , and allows one to iteratively obtain the 
number of clusters.
  Consider the case when the number of clusters q 
is less than the true cluster number K present in the 
dataset.  In such situation, taking the first q  < K 
eigenvectors, we will be selecting a q-dimensional 
subspace in the clustering space. As the rows of the 
K eigenvectors clustered along mutually orthogo- 
nal vectors, their projections in a lower dimensional 
space will cluster along radial directions. Therefore, 
the general picture will be of q clusters elongated in 
the radial direction, with possibly some clusters very 
near the origin (when the subspace is orthogonal to 
some of the discarded eigenvectors).
  Hence,  the K -means algorithm is modified as 
the elongated K -means algorithm to downweight 
distances along radial directions and penalize dis- 
tances along transversal directions.  The elongated 
K -means algorithm computes the distance of point 
x from the center ci as follows:
• If the center is not very near the origin, ci  ci  > E (E is a 
parameter to be fixed by the user), the distances are cal-


4
culated as: edist(x, ci ) = (x − ci )T M (x − ci ), where

eter that controls the elongation (the smaller, 
the more elongated the clusters) 2 .
• If the center is very near the origin,cT ci   < E,  
the dis- tances are measured using the 
Euclidean distance.

  In each iteration of procedure in Table 
1, elon- gated K -means is initialized with 
q centers corre- sponding to data points in 
different clusters and one center in the 
origin. The algorithm then will drag the 
center in the origin towards one of the 
clusters not accounted for.  Compute 
another eigenvector (thus increasing the 
dimension of the clustering space to q + 1) 
and repeat the procedure. Eventually, when 
one reach as many eigenvectors as the 
number of clusters present in the data, no 
points will be as- signed to the center at the 
origin, leaving the cluster empty. This is the 
signal to terminate the algorithm.

3.1   Data Setting
Our proposed unsupervised relation extraction is 
evaluated on ACE corpus, which contains 519 files 
from sources including broadcast, newswire, and 
newspaper.   We only deal with intra-sentence ex- 
plicit relations and assumed that all entities have

training and devtest corpus.


There are at most |T C | clusters which are assigned 
relation type tags.  And if the number of the esti- 
mated clusters is less than the number of the ground 
truth clusters, empty clusters should be added so that
|EC | = |T C | and the one-to-one mapping can be 
performed, which can be formulated as the function:


Ωˆ  = arg maxΩ 2:|T C | tΩ(j),j , where Ω(j) is the in-























been detected beforehand in the EDT sub-task of 
ACE. To verify our proposed method, we only col- 
lect those pairs of entity mentions which have been 
tagged relation types in the given corpus. Then the 
relation type tags were removed to test the unsuper- 
vised relation disambiguation.  During the evalua- 
tion procedure, the relation type tags were used as 
ground truth classes.  A break-down of the data by
24 relation subtypes is given in Table 2.


dex of the estimated cluster associated with the j-th
class.
  Given the result of one-to-one mapping, we adopt 
Precision, Recall and F-measure to evaluate the 
clustering result.

3.3   Experimental Design
We perform our unsupervised relation extraction on 
the devtest set of ACE corpus and evaluate the al- 
gorithm on relation subtype level.  Firstly, we ob- 
serve the influence of various variables, including 
Distance Parameter σ2, Different Features, Context 
Window Size. Secondly, to verify the effectiveness 
of our method, we further compare it with super- 
vised method based on SVM and other two unsuper- 
vised methods.

3.3.1   Choice of Distance Parameter σ2
  We simply search over σ2  and pick the value 
that finds the best aligned set of clusters on the 
transformed space.  Here, the scattering criterion 
trace(P −1PB ) is used to compare the cluster qual- 
ity for different value of σ2 3, which measures the ra- 
tio of between-cluster to within-cluster scatter. The 
higher the trace(P −1PB ),  the higher the cluster



3.2   Evaluation method for clustering result

When assessing the agreement between clustering 
result and manually annotated relation types (ground 
truth classes), we would encounter the problem that 
there was no relation type tags for each cluster in our 
clustering results.
  To resolve the problem, we construct a contin- 
gency table T , where each entry ti,j gives the num- 
ber of the instances that belong to both the i-th es- 
timated cluster and j-th ground truth class.  More- 
over, to ensure that any two clusters do not share


quality.
  In Table 3 and Table 4, with different settings of 
feature set and context window size, we find out the 
corresponding value of σ2 and cluster number which 
maximize the trace value in searching for a range of 
value σ2.

3.3.2	Contribution of Different Features

tures, we report the performance by gradually in- 
creasing the feature set, as Table 3 shows.

tures contribute to the improvement of performance 
more or less. Firstly,the addition of entity type fea- 
ture is very useful, which improves F-measure by
6.6%.  Secondly, adding POS features can increase 
F-measure score but do not improve very much. 
Thirdly, chunking features also show their great use- 
fulness with increasing Precision/Recall/F-measure 
by 5.7%/2.5%/4.5%.
  We combine all these features to do all other eval- 
uations in our experiments.

3.3.3   Setting of Context Window Size

  We have mentioned in Section 2 that the context 
vectors of entity pairs are derived from the contexts 
before, between and after the entity mention pairs. 
Hence, we have to specify the three context window 
size first. In this paper, we set the mid-context win- 
dow as everything between the two entity mentions. 
For the pre- and post- context windows, we could 
have different choices.  For example, if we specify 
the outer context window size as 2, then it means that 
the pre-context (post-context)) includes two words 
before (after) the first (second) entity.
  For comparison of the effect of the outer context 
of entity mention pairs, we conducted three different 
settings of context window size (0, 2, 5) as Table 4 
shows. From this table we can find that with the con- 
text window size setting, 2, the algorithm achieves 
the best performance of 43.5%/49.4%/46.3% in 
Precision/Recall/F-measure. With the context win- 
dow size setting, 5, the performance becomes worse

increases.

3.3.4	Comparison with Supervised methods 
and other Unsupervised methods
  To explore the effectiveness of our unsupervised 
method compared to supervised method, we perform 
SVM technique with the same feature set defined in 
our proposed method. The LIBSVM tool is used in 
this test 4.   The kernel function we used is linear 
and SVM models are trained using the training set 
of ACE corpus.
  In (Hasegawa et al., 2004), they preformed un- 
supervised relation extraction based on hierarchical 
clustering and they only used word features between 
entity mention pairs to construct context vectors. We 
reported the clustering results using the same clus- 
tering strategy as Hasegawa et al. (2004) proposed. 
In Table 5, Hasegawa’s Method1 means the test used 
the word feature as Hasegawa et al. (2004) while 
Hasegawa’s Method2 means the test used the same 
feature set as our method. In both tests, we specified

ware available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/ cjlin/libsvm.  It 
supports multi-class classification.

the cluster number as the number of ground truth 
classes.
  We also approached the relation extraction prob- 
lem using the standard clustering technique, K- 
means, where we adopted the same feature set de- 
fined in our proposed method to cluster the con- 
text vectors of entity mention pairs and pre-specified 
the cluster number as the number of ground truth 
classes.
  Table  5  reports  the  performance  of  our  pro- 
posed method comparing with SVM-based super- 
vised method and the other two unsupervised meth- 
ods. As the result shows, SVM-based method by us- 
ing the same feature set in our proposed method can 
achieve 61.2%/49.6%/54.8% in Precision/Recall/F- 
measure.   Table 5 also shows our proposed spec- 
tral  based  method  clearly  outperforms the  other 
two unsupervised methods by 12.5% and 9.5% in 
F-measure respectively.  Moreover, the incorpora- 
tion of various lexical and syntactic features into 
Hasegawa et al. (2004)’s method2 makes it outper- 
form Hasegawa et al. (2004)’s method1 which only 
uses word feature.

3.4   Discussion

In this paper, we have shown that the modified spec- 
tral clustering technique, with various lexical and 
syntactic features derived from the context of en- 
tity pairs, performed well on the unsupervised re- 
lation disambiguation problem.   Our experiments 
show that by the choice of the distance parameter 
σ2, we can estimate the cluster number which pro- 
vides the tightest clusters.  We notice that the es- 
timated cluster number is less than the number of 
ground truth classes in most cases.  The reason for 
this phenomenon may be that some relation types 
can not be easily distinguished using the context in- 
formation only. For example, the relation subtypes 
“Located”, “Based-In” and “Residence” are difficult


to disambiguate even for human experts to differen- 
tiate.
  The results also show that various lexical and 
syntactic features contain useful information for the 
task.  Especially, although we did not concern the 
dependency tree and full parse tree information as 
other supervised methods (Miller et al., 2000; Cu- 
lotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et 
al., 2005), the incorporation of simple features, such 
as words and chunking information, still can provide 
complement information for capturing the charac- 
teristics of entity pairs.  Another observation from 
the result is that extending the outer context window 
of entity mention pairs too much may not improve 
the performance since the process may incorporate 
more noise information and affect the clustering re- 
sult.
  As regards the clustering technique, the spectral- 
based clustering performs better than direct cluster- 
ing, K-means.  Since the spectral-based algorithm 
works in a transformed space of low dimension- 
ality, data can be easily clustered so that the al- 
gorithm can be implemented with better efficiency 
and speed.  And the performance using spectral- 
based clustering can be improved due to the reason 
that spectral-based clustering overcomes the draw- 
back of K-means (prone to local minima) and may 
find non-convex clusters consistent with human in- 
tuition.
  Currently most of works on the RDC task of ACE 
focused on supervised learning methods.  Table 6 
lists a comparison of these methods on relation de- 
tection and relation classification. Zhou et al. (2005) 
reported the best result as 63.1%/49.5%/55.5% in 
Precision/Recall/F-measure on the extraction of 
ACE relation subtypes using feature based method, 
which outperforms tree kernel based method by 
Culotta and Soresen (2004).  Although our unsu- 
pervised method still can not outperform these su-


pervised methods, from the point of view of un- 
supervised resolution for relation extraction, our 
approach  already  achieves  best  performance  of
43.5%/49.4%/46.3% in Precision/Recall/F-measure
compared with other clustering methods.

4   Conclusion and Future work

In this paper, we approach unsupervised relation dis- 
ambiguation problem by using spectral-based clus- 
tering technique with diverse lexical and syntactic 
features derived from context. The advantage of our 
method is that it doesn’t need any manually labeled 
relation instances, and pre-definition the number of 
the context clusters. Experiment results on the ACE 
corpus show that our method achieves better perfor- 
mance than other unsupervised methods.
  Currently we combine various lexical and syn- 
tactic features to construct context vectors for clus- 
tering.  In the future we will further explore other 
semantic information to assist the relation extrac- 
tion problem.  Moreover, instead of cosine similar- 
ity measure to calculate the distance between con- 
text vectors, we will try other distributional similar- 
ity measures to see whether the performance of re- 
lation extraction can be improved. In addition, if we 
can find an effective unsupervised way to filter out 
unrelated entity pairs in advance, it would make our 
proposed method more practical.
