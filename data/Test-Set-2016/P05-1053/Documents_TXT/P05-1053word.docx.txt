Abstract

Extracting semantic relationships between en- 
tities is  challenging. This paper investigates 
the incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic 
and semantic knowledge in feature-based rela- 
tion extraction using SVM. Our study illus- 
trates  that  the  base  phrase  chunking 
information is very effective for relation ex- 
traction and contributes to most of the per- 
formance improvement from syntactic aspect 
while additional information from full parsing 
gives limited further enhancement. This sug- 
gests that most of useful information in full 
parse trees for relation extraction is shallow 
and can be captured by chunking. We also 
demonstrate how semantic information such as 
WordNet and Name List, can be used in fea- 
ture-based relation extraction to further im- 
prove  the  performance.  Evaluation  on  the 
ACE corpus shows that effective incorporation 
of diverse features enables our system outper- 
form previously best-reported systems on the
24 ACE relation subtypes and significantly 
outperforms tree kernel-based systems by over
20 in F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types.


1   Introduction

With the dramatic increase in the amount of textual 
information available in digital archives and the 
WWW, there has been growing interest in tech- 
niques for automatically extracting information 
from text. Information Extraction (IE) systems are 
expected to identify relevant information (usually 
of pre-defined types) from text documents in a cer- 
tain domain and put them in a structured format.
  According to the scope of the NIST Automatic 
Content  Extraction  (ACE)  program,  current 
research in IE has three main objectives: Entity 
Detection and Tracking (EDT), Relation Detection


and Characterization (RDC), and Event Detection 
and Characterization (EDC). The EDT task entails 
the detection of entity mentions and chaining them 
together by identifying their coreference. In ACE 
vocabulary, entities are objects, mentions are 
references to them, and relations are semantic 
relationships between entities. Entities can be of 
five types: persons, organizations, locations, 
facilities and geo-political entities (GPE: 
geographically defined regions that indicate a 
political  boundary,  e.g.  countries,  states,  cities, 
etc.). Mentions have three levels: names, nomial 
expressions or  pronouns. The  RDC  task  detects 
and classifies implicit and explicit relations1 
between entities identified by the EDT task. For 
example, we want to determine whether a person is 
at a location, based on the evidence in the context. 
Extraction of semantic relationships between 
entities can be very useful for applications such as 
question answering, e.g. to answer the query “Who 
is the president of the United States?”.
  This paper focuses on the ACE RDC task and 
employs diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic 
knowledge  in  feature-based  relation  extraction 
using  Support  Vector  Machines  (SVMs).  Our 
study illustrates that the base phrase chunking 
information contributes to most of the performance 
inprovement from syntactic aspect while additional 
full parsing information does not contribute much, 
largely  due  to  the  fact  that  most  of  relations 
defined in ACE corpus are within a very short 
distance. We also demonstrate how semantic in- 
formation such as WordNet (Miller 1990) and 
Name List can be used in the feature-based frame- 
work. Evaluation shows that the incorporation of 
diverse features enables our system achieve best 
reported performance. It also shows that our fea-

1 In ACE (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Projects/ACE), 
explicit relations occur in text with explicit evidence 
suggesting the relationships. Implicit relations need not 
have explicit supporting evidence in text, though they 
should be evident from a reading of the document.

ture-based approach outperforms tree kernel-based 
approaches by 11 F-measure in relation detection 
and more than 20 F-measure in relation detection 
and classification on the 5 ACE relation types.
  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 presents related work. Section 3 and 
Section 4 describe our approach and various 
features employed respectively. Finally, we present 
experimental setting and  results in Section 5 and 
conclude   with   some   general   observations   in 
relation extraction in Section 6.

2   Related Work

The relation extraction task was formulated at the
7th   Message  Understanding Conference (MUC-7
1998) and is starting to be addressed more and 
more within the natural language processing and 
machine learning communities.
  Miller  et  al  (2000)  augmented  syntactic  full 
parse trees with semantic information correspond- 
ing to entities and relations, and built generative 
models for the augmented trees. Zelenko et al 
(2003) proposed extracting relations by computing 
kernel functions between parse trees. Culotta et al 
(2004) extended this work to estimate kernel func- 
tions between augmented dependency trees and 
achieved 63.2 F-measure in relation detection and
45.8 F-measure in relation detection and classifica- 
tion  on  the  5  ACE  relation  types.  Kambhatla 
(2004) employed Maximum Entropy models for 
relation  extraction  with  features  derived  from 
word, entity type, mention level, overlap, depend- 
ency  tree  and  parse  tree.  It  achieves  52.8  F- 
measure on the 24 ACE relation subtypes. Zhang 
(2004) approached relation classification by com- 
bining various lexical and syntactic features with 
bootstrapping on top of Support Vector Machines.
  Tree kernel-based approaches proposed by Ze- 
lenko et al (2003) and Culotta et al (2004) are able 
to explore the implicit feature space without much 
feature engineering. Yet further research work is 
still expected to make it effective with complicated 
relation extraction tasks such as the one defined in 
ACE. Complicated relation extraction tasks may 
also impose a big challenge to the modeling ap- 
proach used by Miller et al (2000) which integrates 
various   tasks   such   as   part-of-speech  tagging, 
named entity recognition, template element extrac- 
tion and relation extraction, in a single model.
  

This paper will further explore the feature-based 
approach with a systematic study on the extensive 
incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and se- 
mantic information. Compared with Kambhatla 
(2004), we separately incorporate the base phrase 
chunking information, which contributes to most 
of the performance improvement from syntactic 
aspect. We also show how semantic information 
like WordNet and Name List can be equipped to 
further  improve  the  performance. Evaluation on 
the ACE corpus shows that our system outper- 
forms Kambhatla (2004) by about 3 F-measure on 
extracting 24 ACE relation subtypes. It also shows 
that our system outperforms tree kernel-based sys- 
tems (Culotta et al 2004) by over 20 F-measure on 
extracting 5 ACE relation types.

3   Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a supervised 
machine learning technique motivated by the sta- 
tistical learning theory (Vapnik 1998). Based on 
the structural risk minimization of the statistical 
learning theory, SVMs seek an optimal separating 
hyper-plane to divide the training examples into 
two classes and make decisions based on support 
vectors which are selected as the only effective 
instances in the training set.
  Basically, SVMs are binary classifiers. 
Therefore, we must extend SVMs to multi-class 
(e.g. K) such as the ACE RDC task. For efficiency, 
we apply the one vs. others strategy, which builds 
K classifiers so as to separate one class from all 
others,  instead  of  the  pairwise  strategy,  which 
builds K*(K-1)/2 classifiers considering all pairs of 
classes. The final decision of an instance in the 
multiple binary classification is determined by the 
class which has the maximal SVM output. 
Moreover, we only apply the simple linear kernel, 
although other kernels can peform better.
  The reason why we choose SVMs for this 
purpose is that SVMs represent the state-of–the-art 
in  the machine learning research community, and 
there are good implementations of the algorithm 
available. In this paper, we use the binary-class 
SVMLight2 deleveloped by Joachims (1998).


2 Joachims has just released a new version of SVMLight 
for multi-class classification. However, this paper only 
uses the binary-class version. For details about 
SVMLight, please see http://svmlight.joachims.org/


4   Features

The semantic relation is determined between two 
mentions. In addition, we distinguish the argument 
order of the two mentions (M1 for the first mention 
and M2 for the second mention), e.g. M1-Parent- 
Of-M2 vs. M2-Parent-Of-M1. For each pair of 
mentions3, we compute various lexical, syntactic 
and semantic features.

4.1 Words

According to their positions, four categories of 
words are considered: 1) the words of both the 
mentions, 2) the words between the two mentions,
3) the words before M1, and 4) the words after M2. 
For the words of both the mentions, we also differ- 
entiate the head word4 of a mention from other 
words since the head word is generally much more 
important. The words between the two mentions 
are classified into three bins: the first word in be- 
tween, the last word in between and other words in 
between. Both the words before M1 and after M2 
are classified into two bins: the first word next to 
the mention and the second word next to the men- 
tion. Since a pronominal mention (especially neu- 
tral pronoun such as ‘it’ and ‘its’) contains little 
information about the sense of the mention, the co- 
reference chain is used to decide its sense. This is 
done by replacing the pronominal mention with the 
most recent non-pronominal antecedent when de- 
termining the word features, which include:
•  WM1: bag-of-words in M1
•  HM1: head word of M1


3 In ACE, each mention has a head annotation and an 
extent annotation. In all our experimentation, we only 
consider the word string between the beginning point of 
the extent annotation and the end point of the head an- 
notation. This has an effect of choosing the base phrase 
contained in the extent annotation. In addition, this also 
can reduce noises without losing much of information in 
the mention. For example, in the case where the noun 
phrase “the former CEO of McDonald” has the head 
annotation of “CEO” and the extent annotation of “the 
former CEO of McDonald”, we only consider “the for- 
mer CEO” in this paper.
4  In this paper, the head word of a mention is normally 
set as the last word of the mention. However, when a
preposition exists in the mention, its head word is set as
the last word before the preposition. For example, the 
head word of the name mention “University of Michi- 
gan” is “University”.


•  WM2: bag-of-words in M2
•  HM2: head word of M2
•  HM12: combination of HM1 and HM2
•  WBNULL: when no word in between
•  WBFL: the only word in between when only 
one word in between
•  WBF: first word in between when at least two 
words in between
•  WBL: last word in between when at least two 
words in between
•  WBO: other words in between except first and 
last words when at least three words in between
•  BM1F: first word before M1
•  BM1L: second word before M1
•  AM2F: first word after M2
•  AM2L: second word after M2

4.2 Entity Type

This feature concerns about the entity type of both 
the mentions, which can be PERSON, 
ORGANIZATION, FACILITY, LOCATION and 
Geo-Political Entity or GPE:
•  ET12: combination of mention entity types

4.3 Mention Level

This feature considers the entity level of both the 
mentions, which can be NAME, NOMIAL and 
PRONOUN:
•  ML12: combination of mention levels

4.4 Overlap

This category of features includes:
•  #MB: number of other mentions in between
•  #WB: number of words in between
•  M1>M2  or  M1<M2:  flag  indicating  whether
M2/M1is included in M1/M2.
  Normally, the above overlap features are too 
general to be effective alone. Therefore, they are



HM12+M1>M2; 4) HM12+M1<M2.

4.5 Base Phrase  Chunking

It is well known that chunking plays a critical role 
in the Template Relation task of the 7th Message 
Understanding Conference (MUC-7 1998). The 
related work mentioned in Section 2 extended to 
explore the information embedded in the full parse 
trees. In this paper, we separate the features of base


phrase chunking from those of full parsing. In this 
way, we can separately evaluate the contributions 
of base phrase chunking and full parsing. Here, the 
base  phrase  chunks  are  derived  from  full  parse 
trees using the Perl script5 written by Sabine 
Buchholz from Tilburg University and the Collins’ 
parser (Collins 1999) is employed for full parsing. 
Most of the chunking features concern about the 
head words of the phrases between the two men- 
tions. Similar to word features, three categories of 
phrase heads are considered: 1) the phrase heads in 
between are also classified into three bins: the first 
phrase head in between, the last phrase head in 
between and other phrase heads in between; 2) the 
phrase  heads  before  M1  are  classified  into  two 
bins: the first phrase head before and the second 
phrase head before; 3) the phrase heads after M2 
are classified into two bins: the first phrase head 
after and the second phrase head after. Moreover, 
we also consider the phrase path in between.
•  CPHBNULL when no phrase in between
•  CPHBFL: the only phrase head when only one 
phrase in between
•  CPHBF: first phrase head in between when at 
least two phrases in between
•  CPHBL: last phrase head in between when at 
least two phrase heads in between
•  CPHBO: other phrase heads in between except 
first and last phrase heads when at least three 
phrases in between
•  CPHBM1F: first phrase head before M1
•  CPHBM1L: second phrase head before M1
•  CPHAM2F: first phrase head after M2
•  CPHAM2F: second phrase head after M2
•  CPP: path of phrase labels connecting the two 
mentions in the chunking
•  CPPH: path of phrase labels connecting the two 
mentions in the chunking augmented with head 
words, if at most two phrases in between

4.6 Dependency Tree

This  category  of  features  includes  information 
about the words, part-of-speeches and phrase la- 
bels of the words on which the mentions are de- 
pendent in the dependency tree derived from the 
syntactic full parse tree. The dependency tree is 
built by using the phrase head information returned 
by  the  Collins’ parser  and  linking all  the  other


fragments in a phrase to its head. It also includes 
flags indicating whether the two mentions are in 
the same NP/PP/VP.
•  ET1DW1: combination of the entity type and 
the dependent word for M1
•  H1DW1: combination of the head word and the 
dependent word for M1
•  ET2DW2: combination of the entity type and 
the dependent word for M2
•  H2DW2: combination of the head word and the 
dependent word for M2
• ET12SameNP:  combination  of  ET12  and 
whether M1 and M2 included in the same NP
• ET12SamePP:  combination  of  ET12  and 
whether M1 and M2 exist in the same PP
• ET12SameVP:  combination  of  ET12  and 
whether M1 and M2 included in the same VP

4.7 Parse Tree

This category of features concerns about the in- 
formation inherent only in the full parse tree.
•  PTP:  path  of  phrase  labels  (removing  dupli- 
cates) connecting M1 and M2 in the parse tree
• PTPH: path of phrase labels (removing dupli- 
cates) connecting M1 and M2 in the parse tree 
augmented with the head word of the top phrase 
in the path.

4.8 Semantic Resources

Semantic information from various resources, such 
as WordNet, is used to classify important words 
into different semantic lists according to their indi- 
cating relationships.

Country  Name List

This is to differentiate the relation subtype 
“ROLE.Citizen-Of”, which defines the relationship 
between a person and the country of the person’s 
citizenship, from other subtypes, especially 
“ROLE.Residence”, where defines the relationship 
between a person and the location in which the 
person lives. Two features are defined to include 
this information:
•  ET1Country: the entity type of M1 when M2 is 
a country name
•  CountryET2: the entity type of M2 when M1 is 
a country name

Personal Relative Trigger  Word List

This is used to differentiate the six personal social 
relation subtypes in ACE: Parent, Grandparent, 
Spouse, Sibling, Other-Relative and Other- 
Personal. This trigger word list is first gathered 
from WordNet by checking whether a word has the 
semantic class “person|…|relative”. Then, all the 
trigger  words  are  semi-automatically6   classified 
into different categories according to their related 
personal social relation subtypes. We also extend 
the list by collecting the trigger words from the 
head words of the mentions in the training data 
according to their indicating relationships. Two 
features are defined to include this information:
•  ET1SC2: combination of the entity type of M1 
and the semantic class of M2 when M2 triggers 
a personal social subtype.
•  SC1ET2: combination of the entity type of M2 
and the semantic class of M1 when the first 
mention triggers a personal social subtype.

5   Experimentation

This paper uses the ACE corpus provided by LDC 
to train and evaluate our feature-based relation ex- 
traction system. The ACE corpus is gathered from 
various newspapers, newswire and broadcasts. In 
this paper, we only model explicit relations be- 
cause of poor inter-annotator agreement in the an- 
notation of implicit relations and their limited 
number.

5.1 Experimental Setting

We use the official ACE corpus from LDC. The 
training set consists of 674 annotated text docu- 
ments (~300k words) and 9683 instances of rela- 
tions. During development, 155 of 674 documents 
in the training set are set aside for fine-tuning the 
system. The testing set is held out only for final 
evaluation. It consists of 97 documents (~50k 
words) and 1386 instances of relations. Table 1 
lists the types and subtypes of  relations for the 
ACE Relation Detection and Characterization 
(RDC) task, along with their frequency of occur- 
rence in the ACE training set. It shows that the

6  Those words that have the semantic classes “Parent”, 
“GrandParent”, “Spouse” and “Sibling” are automati- 
cally set with the same classes without change. How- 
ever, The remaining words that do not have above four 
classes are manually classified.


ACE corpus suffers from a small amount of anno- 
tated data for a few subtypes such as the subtype 
“Founder” under the type “ROLE”. It also shows 
that the ACE RDC task defines some difficult sub- 
types such as the subtypes “Based-In”, “Located” 
and “Residence” under the type “AT”, which are 
difficult even for human experts to differentiate.

Table 1: Relation types and subtypes in the ACE 
training data

  In this paper, we explicitly model the argument 
order of the two mentions involved. For example, 
when comparing mentions m1 and m2, we distin- 
guish between m1-ROLE.Citizen-Of-m2 and m2- 
ROLE.Citizen-Of-m1. Note that only 6 of these 24 
relation subtypes are symmetric: “Relative- 
Location”, “Associate”, “Other-Relative”, “Other- 
Professional”,  “Sibling”,  and  “Spouse”.  In  this 
way, we model relation extraction as a multi-class 
classification  problem  with  43  classes,  two  for 
each relation subtype (except the above 6 symmet- 
ric subtypes) and a “NONE” class for the case 
where the two mentions are not related.

5.2     Experimental Results
In this paper, we only measure the performance of 
relation extraction on “true” mentions with “true” 
chaining of coreference (i.e. as annotated by the 
corpus annotators) in the ACE corpus. Table 2 
measures the performance of our relation extrac-


tion system over the 43 ACE relation subtypes on 
the testing set. It shows that our system achieves 
best performance of 63.1%/49.5%/ 55.5 in preci- 
sion/recall/F-measure when combining diverse 
lexical, syntactic and semantic features. Table 2 
also measures the contributions of different fea- 
tures by gradually increasing the feature set. It 
shows that:

Features	P	R	F 
Words	69.2	23.7	35.3
+Entity Type	67.1	32.1	43.4
+Mention Level	67.1	33.0	44.2
+Overlap	57.4	40.9	47.8
+Chunking	61.5	46.5	53.0
+Dependency Tree	62.1	47.2	53.6
+Parse Tree	62.3	47.6	54.0
  +Semantic Resources        63.1          49.5          55.5       
Table 2: Contribution of different features over 43 
relation subtypes in the test data

•  Using word features only achieves the perform- 
ance of 69.2%/23.7%/35.3 in precision/recall/F- 
measure.
•  Entity type features are very useful and improve 
the F-measure by 8.1 largely due to the recall 
increase.
•  The usefulness of mention level features is quite 
limited. It only improves the F-measure by 0.8 
due to the recall increase.
• Incorporating the overlap features gives some 
balance between precision and recall. It in- 
creases the F-measure by 3.6 with a big preci- 
sion decrease and a big recall increase.
•  Chunking features are very useful. It increases 
the  precision/recall/F-measure by  4.1%/5.6%/
5.2 respectively.
•  To our surprise, incorporating the dependency 
tree and parse tree features only improve the F- 
measure by 0.6 and 0.4 respectively. This may 
be due to the fact that most of relations in the 
ACE corpus are quite local. Table 3 shows that 
about 70% of relations exist where two men- 
tions are embedded in each other or separated 
by at most one word. While short-distance rela- 
tions dominate and can be resolved by above 
simple features, the dependency tree and parse 
tree features can only take effect in the remain- 
ing much less long-distance relations. However, 
full parsing is always prone to long distance er- 
rors although the Collins’ parser used in our 
system represents the state-of-the-art in full 
parsing.


• Incorporating semantic resources such as the 
country name list and the personal relative trig- 
ger word list further increases the F-measure by
1.5 largely due to the differentiation of the rela- 
tion subtype “ROLE.Citizen-Of” from “ROLE. 
Residence”  by  distinguishing  country  GPEs 
from other GPEs. The effect of personal relative 
trigger words is very limited due to the limited 
number of testing instances over personal social 
relation subtypes.
  Table 4 separately measures the performance of 
different relation types and major subtypes. It also 
indicates the number of testing instances, the num- 
ber of correctly classified instances and the number 
of wrongly classified instances for each type or 
subtype. It is not surprising that the performance 
on the relation type “NEAR” is low because it oc- 
curs rarely in both the training and testing data. 
Others like “PART.Subsidary” and “SOCIAL. 
Other-Professional” also suffer from their low oc- 
currences. It also shows that our system performs 
best on the subtype “SOCIAL.Parent” and “ROLE. 
Citizen-Of”. This is largely due to incorporation of 
two semantic resources, i.e. the country name list 
and the personal relative trigger word list. Table 4 
also indicates the low performance on the relation 
type “AT” although it frequently occurs in both the 
training and testing data. This suggests the diffi- 
culty of detecting and classifying the relation type 
“AT” and its subtypes.
  Table 5 separates the performance of relation 
detection from overall performance on the testing 
set. It shows that our system achieves the perform- 
ance of 84.8%/66.7%/74.7 in precision/recall/F- 
measure on relation detection. It also shows that 
our   system   achieves   overall   performance   of
77.2%/60.7%/68.0 and 63.1%/49.5%/55.5 in preci- 
sion/recall/F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types 
and the best-reported systems on the ACE corpus. It 
shows that our system achieves better perform- ance 
by ~3 F-measure largely due to its gain in recall. It 
also shows that feature-based methods dramatically 
outperform kernel methods. This sug- gests that 
feature-based methods can effectively combine  
different  features  from  a   variety  of sources 
(e.g. WordNet and gazetteers) that can be brought to 
bear on relation extraction. The tree kernels 
developed in Culotta et al (2004) are yet to be 
effective on the ACE RDC task.
  Finally, Table 6 shows the distributions of er- 
rors. It shows that 73% (627/864) of errors results


from relation detection and 27% (237/864) of er- 
rors results from relation characterization, among 
which 17.8% (154/864) of errors are from misclas- 
sification across relation types and 9.6% (83/864)

# of relations


of errors are from misclassification of relation sub- 
types inside the same relation types. This suggests 
that relation detection is critical for relation extrac- 
tion.

6   Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a feature-based 
approach for relation extraction where diverse 
lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge are em- 
ployed. Instead of exploring the full parse tree in- 
formation directly as previous related work, we 
incorporate the base phrase chunking information


performance improvement from syntactic aspect 
while further incorporation of the parse tree and 
dependence tree information only slightly im- 
proves the performance. This may be due to three 
reasons: First, most of relations defined in ACE 
have  two  mentions  being  close  to  each  other. 
While short-distance relations dominate and can be 
resolved by simple features such as word and 
chunking features, the further dependency tree and 
parse tree features can only take effect in the re- 
maining much less and more difficult long-distance 
relations. Second, it is well known that full parsing


is always prone to long-distance parsing errors al- 
though the Collins’ parser used in our system 
achieves the state-of-the-art performance. There- 
fore, the state-of-art full parsing still needs to be 
further enhanced to provide accurate enough in- 
formation, especially PP (Preposition Phrase) at- 
tachment. Last, effective ways need to be explored
to  incorporate information embedded in  the  full

mantic information such as WordNet and Name 
List, can be used in feature-based relation extrac- 
tion to further improve the performance.
  The effective incorporation of diverse features 
enables our system outperform previously best- 
reported  systems  on  the  ACE  corpus.  Although 
tree kernel-based approaches facilitate the explora- 
tion of the implicit feature space with the parse tree 
structure, yet the current technologies are expected 
to be further advanced to be effective for relatively 
complicated relation extraction tasks such as the 
one defined in ACE where 5 types and 24 subtypes 
need to be extracted. Evaluation on the ACE RDC 
task shows that our approach of combining various 
kinds of evidence can scale better to problems, 
where we have a lot of relation types with a rela- 
tively small amount of annotated data. The ex- 
periment result also shows that our feature-based 
approach outperforms the tree kernel-based ap- 
proaches by more than 20 F-measure on the extrac- 
tion of 5 ACE relation types.
  In the future work, we will focus on exploring 
more semantic knowledge in relation extraction, 
which has not been covered by current research. 
Moreover, our current work is done when the En- 
tity Detection and Tracking (EDT) has been per- 
fectly done. Therefore, it would be interesting to
see how imperfect EDT affects the performance in
relation extraction.
