Abstract

Relation extraction is the task of recog- 
nizing semantic relations among entities. 
Given a particular  sentence supervised ap- 
proaches to Relation Extraction  employed 
feature or kernel functions which usu- 
ally have a single sentence in their scope. 
The overall aim of this paper is to pro- 
pose methods for using knowledge and re- 
sources that are external to the target sen- 
tence,  as a way to improve relation ex- 
traction. We demonstrate this by exploit- 
ing background  knowledge  such as rela- 
tionships  among the target  relations,   as 
well as  by considering how target rela- 
tions relate to some existing  knowledge 
resources.  Our methods are general and 
we suggest that some of them could be ap- 
plied to other NLP tasks.

1   Introduction

Relation extraction (RE) is the task of detecting 
and characterizing  semantic relations expressed 
between entities in text. For instance, given the 
sentence “Cone,  a Kansas City native, was origi- 
nally signed by the Royals and broke into the ma- 
jors with the team.”, one of the relations we might 
want to extract is the employment relation between 
the pair of entity mentions “Cone” and “Royals”. 
RE is important for many NLP applications such 
as building an ontology of entities, biomedical in- 
formation extraction, and question answering.
  Prior work have employed  diverse approaches 
towards resolving the task. One approach is to 
build supervised RE systems using sentences an- 
notated with entity mentions and predefined target


relations.  When given a new sentence, the RE sys- 
tem has to detect and disambiguate  the presence of 
any predefined relations that might exist between 
each of the mention pairs in the sentence. In build- 
ing these systems, researchers used a wide variety 
of features (Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; 
Jiang and Zhai, 2007). Some of the common fea- 
tures used to analyze the target sentence include 
the words appearing in the sentence, their part-of- 
speech (POS) tags, the syntactic parse of the sen- 
tence, and the dependency path between the pair 
of mentions. In a related line of work, researchers 
have also proposed various kernel functions based 
on different structured representations (e.g. de- 
pendency or syntactic tree parses) of the target 
sentences (Bunescu and Mooney,  2005; Zhou et 
al., 2007; Zelenko  et al., 2003; Zhang et al.,
2006). Additionally,  researchers have tried to au- 
tomatically  extract examples for supervised learn- 
ing from  resources such as Wikipedia (Weld et al.,
2008)  and databases (Mintz et al., 2009), or at- 
tempted open information  extraction (IE) (Banko 
et al., 2007) to extract all possible relations.

  In this work, we focus on supervised RE. In 
prior work, the feature and kernel functions  em- 
ployed are usually restricted to being defined on 
the various representations (e.g. lexical or struc- 
tural) of the target sentences. However, in recog- 
nizing relations, humans are not thus constrained 
and rely on an abundance of implicit world knowl- 
edge or background information. What quantifies 
as world or background knowledge is rarely ex- 
plored in the RE literature and we do not attempt 
to provide complete nor precise definitions in this 
paper. However, we show that by considering the 
relationship between our relations of interest,  as

well as how they relate to some existing  knowl- 
edge resources,  we improve the performance of 
RE. Specifically, the contributions of this paper 
are the following:
• When our relations of interest are clustered 
or organized in a hierarchical  ontology,  we 
show how to use this information to improve 
performance.  By defining appropriate con-
straints between the predictions of relations 
at different levels of the hierarchy, we obtain 
globally  coherent predictions  as well as im- 
proved performance.
• Coreference  is a  generic relationship  that 
might exists among entity mentions and we 
show how to exploit this information by as- 
suming that co-referring  mentions have no
other interesting relations. We capture this 
intuition  by using coreference information  to 
constraint the predictions of a RE system.
• When characterizing  the relationship be- 
tween a  pair of mentions,  one can use  a 
large encyclopedia such as Wikipedia  to in- 
fer more knowledge about the two mentions.
In this work, after probabilistically map- 
ping mentions to their respective Wikipedia 
pages, we check whether the mentions  are 
related.  Another generic relationship  that 
might exists  between  a pair of mentions is 
whether they have a parent-child relation and 
we use this as additional  information.
• The sparsity of features (especially  lexical 
features) is a common  problem  for super- 
vised systems.  In this work, we show that 
one can make fruitful use of unlabeled data,
by using word clusters automatically  gath- 
ered from unlabeled  texts  as a way of gen- 
eralizing the lexical features.
• We combine the various relational  predic- 
tions and background  knowledge  through  a 
global inference  procedure,  which we for- 
malize via an Integer Linear Programming
(ILP) framework as a constraint optimization 
problem (Roth and Yih, 2007). This allows 
us to easily incorporate various constraints 
that encode the background knowledge.
  

Roth and Yih (2004) develop a relation extrac- 
tion approach that exploits constraints among en- 
tity types and the relations allowed among them. 
We extend this view significantly, within a simi- 
lar computational framework, to exploit relations 
among target relations, background information 
and world knowledge,  as a way to improve rela- 
tion extraction and make globally  coherent predic- 
tions.
  In the rest of this paper, we first describe the 
features used in our basic RE system in Section 2. 
We then describe how we make use of background 
knowledge in Section 3. In Section 4, we show 
our experimental results and perform analysis in 
Section 5. In Section 6, we discuss related work, 
before concluding in Section 7.

2   Relation Extraction System

In this section, we describe the features used in 
our basic relation extraction (RE) system. Given 
a pair of mentions m1  and m2  occurring within 
the same sentence,  the system predicts whether 
any of the predefined relation holds between the 
two mentions.  Since relations are usually asym- 
metric in  nature, hence  in  all  of  our experi- 
ments, unless otherwise stated, we distinguish be- 
tween the argument ordering of the two mentions. 
For instance,  we consider m1:emp-org:m2 and 
m2:emp-org:m1 to be distinct relation types.
Most of the features  used in our system  are
based on the work in (Zhou et al., 2005). In this 
paper, we propose some new collocation  features 
inspired by word sense disambiguation  (WSD). 
We give an overview of the features in Table 1. 
Due to space limitations, we only describe the col- 
location features and refer the reader to (Zhou et 
al., 2005) for the rest of the features.

2.1   Collocation Features
Following (Zhou et al., 2005), we use  a single 
word to represent the head word of a mention. 
Since single words might be ambiguous or poly- 
semous, we incorporate local collocation  features 
which were found to be very useful for WSD. 
Given the head word hwm  of a mention  m, the 
collocation feature Ci,j  refers to the sequence of 
tokens in the immediate context of hwm. The off- 
sets i and j denote the position (relative to hwm)

of the first and last token of the sequence respec- 
tively. For instance, C−1,+1 denotes a sequence of 
three tokens, consisting of the single token on the 
immediate left of hwm, the token hwm itself, and 
the single token on the immediate right of hwm. 
For each mention, we extract 5 features: C−1,−1, 
C+1,+1, C−2,−1, C−1,+1, and C+1,+2.

3   Using Background Knowledge

Now we describe how we inject additional knowl- 
edge into our relation extraction system.

3.1   Hierarchy of Relations

When our relations of interest are arranged in a 
hierarchical structure, one should leverage this in- 
formation to learn more accurate relation predic- 
tors. For instance, assume that our relations  are 
arranged in a two-level hierarchy and we learn 
two classifiers,  one for disambiguating  between 
the first level coarse-grained relations, and an- 
other for disambiguating between the second level



fine-grained relations.
  Since there are a lot more fine-grained relation 
types than coarse-grained relation types, we pro- 
pose using the coarse-grained predictions which 
should intuitively be more reliable, to improve the 
fine-grained predictions. We show how to achieve 
this through defining appropriate constraints be- 
tween the coarse-grained and fine-grained rela- 
tions, which can be enforced through the Con- 
strained Conditional Models framework (aka ILP) 
(Roth and Yih, 2007; Chang et al., 2008). Due 
to space limitations, we refer interested  readers 
to the papers for more information on the CCM 
framework.
  By doing this, not only are the predictions of 
both classifiers coherent with each other (thus ob- 
taining better predictions  from both classifiers), 
but more importantly,  we are effectively  using the 
(more reliable) predictions of the coarse-grained 
classifier to constrain the predictions of the fine- 
grained classifier.  To the best of our knowledge, 
this approach for RE is novel.
  In this paper, we work on the NIST Automatic 
Content Extraction (ACE) 2004 corpus. ACE de- 
fines several coarse-grained relations such as em- 
ployment/membership, geo-political  entity (GPE) 
affiliation, etc.  Each coarse-grained relation is 
further refined into several fine-grained relations1 
and each fine-grained  relation  has a unique  par- 
ent coarse-grained relation. For instance, the fine- 
grained relations employed as ordinary  staff, em- 
ployed as an executive, etc. are children relations 
of employment/membership.
  Let mi  and mj  denote a pair of mentions i and 
j drawn from a document containing N mentions. 
Let Ri,j denote a relation between mi and mj , and
let R = {Ri,j }, where 1≤i, j≤N ; i/=j denote the
set of relations in the document. Also, we denote

the set of predefined coarse-grained relation types 
and fine-grained  relation  types as LRc  and LRf
respectively.  Since there could possibly be no re- 
lation between a mention pair, we add the null la-
bel to LRc  and LRf , allowing our classifiers to
predict null for Ri,j . Finally, for a fine-grained  re- 
lation type rf , let V(rf ) denote its parent coarse-
grained relation type.

  1 With the exception of the Discourse coarse-grained re- 
lation.



  We learn two classifiers, one for disambiguat- 
ing between the coarse-grained relations and one 
for disambiguating between the fine-grained rela- 
tions. Let θc and θf  denote the feature weights 
learned  for predicting  coarse-grained and fine- 
grained  relations  respectively.  Let pR(rc)   =
logPc(rc|mi, mj ; θc) be the log probability that
relation R is predicted to be of coarse-grained
relation type rc.     Similarly,  let  pR(rf )   =
logPf (rf |mi, mj ; θf ) be the log probability that
relation R is predicted to be of fine-grained re-
lation type rf .  Let x(R,rc) be a binary variable 
which takes on the value of 1 if relation R is la- 
beled with the coarse-grained label rc. Similarly, 
let y(R,rf ) be a binary variable which takes on the 
value of 1 if relation R is labeled with the fine- 
grained label rf . Our objective function is then:


art:	Ei  ∈{gpe, org, per},
Ej  ∈{fac, gpe, veh, wea}
emp-org:	Ei  ∈{gpe, org, per},
Ej  ∈{gpe, org, per}
gpe-aff:	Ei  ∈{gpe, org, per},
Ej  ∈{gpe, loc}
other-aff:	Ei  ∈{gpe, org, per},
Ej  ∈{gpe, loc}
per-soc:	Ei  ∈{per}, Ej  ∈{per}

Table 2: Entity type constraints.



which is a child of rc. The logical form of Equa- 
tion (7) can be written as: y(R,rf ) ⇒ x(R,V(rf )).
This captures the inverse relation and states that 
if we assign rf to R, then we must also assign to
R the relation type V(rf ), which is the parent of
rf . Together, Equations (6) and (7) constrain the
predictions of the coarse-grained and fine-grained 
classifiers to be coherent with each other. Finally,

This method  
is general  and 
is applicable 
to



subject to the following constraints:


other NLP tasks where  a hierarchy  
exists,  such as WSD and question 
answering. For instance,

one can 
predict 
coarse-
grained and 
fine- 
grained  
senses 
using 
suitably

x(R,rc) ∈ {0, 1}  ∀R ∈ R, rc ∈ LRc 	(4)
y(R,rf ) ∈ {0, 1}  ∀R ∈ R, rf ∈ LRf    (5)

  Equations (2) and (3) require that each relation 
can only be assigned one coarse-grained label and 
one fine-grained label. Equations (4) and (5) indi- 
cate that x(R,rc) and y(R,rf ) are binary variables. 
Two more constraints follow:
)



3.2   Entity Type Constraints

Each mention in ACE-2004 is annotated with one 
of seven coarse-grained entity types: person (per), 
organization (org), location (loc), geo-political en- 
tity (gpe), facility (fac), vehicle (veh), and weapon 
(wea).
Roth and Yih (2007) had shown that entity type


x(R,rc) ≤



{rf ∈LRf |V(rf 
)=rc}


y(R,rf )


information is 
useful for 
constraining 
the possible
labels that a 
relation R can 
assume. For 
instance,


∀R ∈ R , rc ∈ LRc 	(6)


both mentions involved in a personal/social   re-
per. In this work,


y(R,rf ) ≤ x(R,V(rf ))  ∀R ∈ R, rf ∈ LRf   (7)

  The logical form of Equation (6) can be written 
as:  x(R,rc)  ⇒ y(R,rf1 ) ∨ y(R,rf2 ) . . . ∨ y(R,rfn ),
where rf1, rf2, . . . , rfn  are (child) fine-grained
relations of the coarse-grained relation rc.  This 
states that if we assign rc to relation R, then we 
must also assign to R a fine-grained  relation  rf


lation must be of entity type
we gather such information  from the ACE-2004 
documentation and inject it as constraints (on the 
coarse-grained relations)  into our system. Due 
to space  limitations, we do not state  the con- 
straint equations or objective function here, but 
we list the entity type constraints we imposed for 
each coarse-grained  relation mi-R-mj   in Table


22, where Ei  (Ej ) denotes the allowed  set of en- 
tity types for mention mi  (mj ). Applying the en- 
tity type information  improves the predictions of 
the coarse-grained classifier and this in turn could 
improve the predictions of the fine-grained classi- 
fier.

3.3   Using Coreference Information
We  can also utilize the coreference relations 
among entity mentions. Assuming that we know 
mentions mi   and mj   are coreferent  with each 
other,  then there should be no relation  between



are represented in Wikipedia), we could use the 
content on their Wikipedia pages to check whether 
they are related.
  In this work, we use  a  Wiki system  (Rati- 
nov et al., 2010) which performs context-sensitive 
mapping  of mentions  to Wikipedia pages.    In 
their work, the authors first identify phrases or 
mentions  that could be mapped.  The correct 
Wikipedia article for each mention  is then prob- 
abilistically  predicted using a combination of fea- 
tures based on Wikipedia  hyperlink structure, se- 
mantic coherence, etc. The authors’ own evalua-


them3. Let z


be a binary 
variable which 
takes


tion results 
indicate that the 
performance of 
their


on the value of 1 if mentions mi and mj are coref-
erent, and 0 if they are not. When z(i,j)=1, we cap- 
ture the above intuition with the following con-
straints:


system ranges from 70–80%.  When given a pair 
of mentions and the system returns the Wikipedia 
page for either one of the mentions, we introduce 
a feature:


z(i,j) ≤ x(Ri,j ,null)	(8)		i



z(i,j) ≤ y(Ri,j ,null)	(9)
which can be written in logical form as: z(i,j)  ⇒



w1(mi, mj ) =


 1,   if Am  (mj )
or Amj (mi)
 0,   otherwise


x(Ri,j ,null), and z(i,j)  ⇒ y(Ri,j ,null).  We add the
following to our objective function in Equation
(1):


where Ami (mj ) returns true if the head extent
of mj   is found (via simple string matching) in
the predicted Wikipedia article of mi.   The in-
terpretation of Amj (mi) is similar. We introduce

feature 
into the 
RE system 
by 
combining 
w1(mi, mj 
) with mi, 
mj  E-
maintype  
(defined as 
in Table 
1).


where m is the set of mentions in a document,
co(i,j) and c¯o(i,j) are the log probabilities of pre- 
dicting that mi  and mj   are coreferent  and not 
coreferent respectively.  In this work, we assume 
we are given coreference information,  which is 
available from the ACE annotation.

3.4   Using Knowledge from Wikipedia
We  propose two ways of using Wikipedia to 
gather features for relation extraction. Wikipedia 
is a huge online encyclopedia and mainly contains 
articles describing entities or concepts.
  The first intuition is that if we are able to cor- 
rectly map a pair of mentions mi  and mj  to their 
corresponding Wikipedia article (assuming they

  2 We do not impose entity type constraints on the coarse- 
grained relations disc and phys.
     3 In this work, we assume that no relations are reflexive. 
After the experiments in this paper are performed,  we ver-
  

The second feature  based on Wikipedia is as 
follows. It will be useful to check whether there 
is any parent-child  relationship between two men- 
tions. Intuitively, this will be useful for recogniz- 
ing several relations  such as physical part-whole 
(e.g. a city is part of a state), subsidiary  (a com- 
pany is a child-company  of another), citizenship 
(a person is a citizen of a country),  etc.
  Given a pair of mentions mi  and mj , we use a 
Parent-Child system (Do and Roth, 2010) to pre- 
dict whether they have a parent-child  relation. To 
achieve this, the system first gathers all Wikipedia 
articles that are related to mi and mj . It then uses 
the words in these pages and the category ontol- 
ogy of Wikipedia to make its parent-child predic- 
tions, while respecting certain defined constraints. 
In this work, we use its prediction  as follows:
( 1,   if parent-child(m , m )


ified that in the ACE corpus we used, less than 1% of the
relations are reflexive.

0,   otherwise

erarchy from (Koo et al., 2008).


where we combine w2(mi, mj ) with mi, mj  E- 
maintype, introducing this as a new feature into 
our RE system.

3.5   Using Word Clusters

An inherent problem faced by supervised systems 
is that of data sparseness.   To mitigate  such is- 
sues in the lexical features, we use word clusters 
which are automatically generated from unlabeled 
texts. In this work, we use the Brown clustering 
algorithm (Brown et al., 1992), which has been 
shown to improve  performance in various NLP 
applications  such as dependency parsing (Koo et 
al., 2008), named entity recognition (Ratinov and 
Roth, 2009), and relation extraction (Boschee et 
al., 2005). The algorithm performs a hierarchical 
clustering of the words  and represents them as a 
binary tree.
  Each word is uniquely identified by its path 
from the root and every path is represented with 
a bit string. Figure 1 shows an example clustering 
where the maximum path length is 3. By using 
path prefixes of different  lengths, one can obtain 
clusterings at different granularity. For instance, 
using prefixes of length 2 will put apple and pear 
into the same cluster, Apple and IBM into the same 
cluster, etc. In our work, we use clusters gener- 
ated from New York Times text and simply  use a 
path prefix of length 10. When Brown clusters are 
used in our system, all lexical features consisting 
of single words will be duplicated.  For instance, 
for the feature hw of m1, one new feature which is 
the length-10 bit string path representing the orig- 
inal lexical head word of m1, will be introduced 
and presented to the classifier as a string feature.

4   Experiments

We  used  the ACE-2004 dataset (catalog 
LDC2005T09 from the Linguistic Data Con- 
sortium) to conduct our experiments.  ACE-2004


defines 7 coarse-grained relations  and 23 fine- 
grained relations.  In all of our experiments, 
unless otherwise  stated, we explicitly model the 
argument  order (of the mentions)  when asked 
to disambiguate the relation between  a pair of 
mentions. Hence,  we built our coarse-grained 
classifier with 15 relation labels to disambiguate 
between (two for each coarse-grained  relation 
type and a null label when the two mentions are 
not related). Likewise, our fine-grained classifier 
has to disambiguate between 47 relation labels. 
In the dataset, relations  do not cross  sentence 
boundaries.
  For our experiments, we trained regularized av- 
eraged perceptrons (Freund and Schapire, 1999), 
implemented within the Sparse Network  of Win- 
now framework (Carlson et al., 1999), one for pre- 
dicting the coarse-grained relations  and another 
for predicting the fine-grained relations. Since the 
dataset has no split of training, development, and 
test sets, we followed prior work (Jiang and Zhai,
2007) and performed 5-fold cross validation  to ob- 
tain our performance results. For simplicity, we 
used 5 rounds of training  and a regularization  pa- 
rameter of 1.5 for the perceptrons in all our exper- 
iments. Finally, we concentrate on the evaluation 
of fine-grained relations.


4.1   Performance of the Basic RE system

As a gauge on the performance  of our basic rela- 
tion extraction system BasicRE using only the fea- 
tures described in Section 2, we compare against 
the state-of-the-art  feature-based RE system of 
Jiang and Zhai (2007). However, we note that in 
that work, the authors performed their evaluation 
using undirected coarse-grained relations. That is, 
they do not distinguish on argument order of men- 
tions and the classifier has to decide among 8 re- 
lation labels (7 coarse-grained relation types and a 
null label). Performing 5-fold cross validation on 
the news wire (nwire) and broadcast news (bnews) 
corpora in the ACE-2004  dataset, they reported a 
F-measure of 71.5 using a maximum entropy clas- 
sifier4. Evaluating BasicRE on the same setting,


  4 After they heuristically performed feature selection and 
applied the heuristics giving  the best evaluation performance, 
they obtained a result of 72.9.

Table 3: BasicRE gives the performance of our basic RE system on predicting fine-grained relations, 
obtained by performing 5-fold cross validation on only the news wire corpus of ACE-2004.  Each sub- 
sequent row +Hier, +Hier+relEntC, +Coref, +Wiki, and +Cluster gives the individual  contribution 
from using each knowledge.  The bottom row +ALL gives the performance improvements from adding
+Hier+relEntC+Coref+Wiki+Cluster. ∼ indicates no change in score.




we obtained a competitive  F-measure of 71.25.

4.2   Experimental  Settings for Evaluating
Fine-grained Relations

Two of our knowledge  sources, the Wiki system 
described in Section 3.4 and the word clusters de- 
scribed in Section 3.5, assume inputs  of mixed- 
cased  text.  We note that the bnews corpus  of 
ACE-2004 is entirely in lower-cased text. Hence, 
we use only the nwire corpus for our experiments 
here, from which we gathered 28,943 relation in- 
stances and 2,226 of those have a valid (non-null) 
relation6.
  We also propose  the following experimental 
setting. First, since we made use of coreference 
information,  we made sure that while performing 
our experiments, all instances from the same doc- 
ument are either all used  as training data or all 
used as test data. Prior work in RE had not en- 
sured this, but we argue that this provides a more 
realistic setting. Our own experiments indicate 
that this results in a 1-2%  lower performance on 
fine-grained relations.
  Secondly,  prior work calculate  their perfor- 
mance on relation extraction at the level of men- 
tions.  That is, each mention  pair extracted  is 
scored individually.  An issue with this way of 
scoring on the ACE corpus is that ACE annota-

  5 Using 10 rounds of training and a regularization param- 
eter of 2.5 improves the result to 72.2. In general, we found 
that more rounds of training and a higher regularization value


tors rarely duplicate a relation link for coreferent 
mentions.  For instance, assume that mentions mi, 
mj , and mk  exist in a given  sentence, mentions 
mi  and mj  are coreferent,  and the annotator  es- 
tablishes a particular relation type r between mj 
and mk . The annotator will not usually duplicate 
the same relation r between mi  and mk  and thus 
the label between these two mentions is then null. 
We are not suggesting that this is an incorrect ap- 
proach, but clearly there is an issue since an im- 
portant goal of performing RE is to populate or 
build an ontology of entities and establish the re- 
lations existing among the entities. Thus, we eval- 
uate our performance at the entity-level.7   That is, 
given a pair of entities, we establish the set of re- 
lation  types existing  between them, based on their 
mention annotations. Then we calculate recall 
and precision  based on these established relations. 
Of course, performing  such an evaluation requires 
knowledge about the coreference relations and in 
this work, we assume we are given this informa- 
tion.

4.3   Knowledge-Enriched  System

Evaluating our system BasicRE (trained only on 
the features described in Section 2) on the nwire 
corpus, we obtained a F1 score of 50.5, as shown 
in Table 3. Next, we exploited the relation hier- 
archy as in Section 3.1 and obtained an improve- 
ment of 1.3, as shown  in the row +Hier.  Next, 
we added the entity type constraints of Section


benefits coarse-grained relation classification, but not fine-	 	


grained relation classification.
     6 The number of relation instances in the nwire and bnews 
corpora are about the same.
  

7 Our experiments indicate that performing the usual eval- 
uation on mentions gives similar performance figures and the 
trend in Table 3 stays the same.


3.2. Remember that these constraints are imposed 
on the coarse-grained relations. Thus, they would 
only affect the fine-grained relation predictions if 
we also exploit the relation hierarchy.  In the ta- 
ble, we show that all the background knowledge 
helped to improve performance, providing a to- 
tal improvement of 3.9 to our basic RE system. 
Though the focus of this work is on fine-grained 
relations, our approach also improves the perfor- 
mance of coarse-grained relation predictions. Ba- 
sicRE obtains a F1 score of 65.3 on coarse-grained 
relations and exploiting  background knowledge 
gives a total improvement of 2.9.



5   Analysis


We explore the situation where we have very little 
training data. We assume during  each cross val- 
idation fold, we are given only 10% of the train- 
ing data we originally  had. Previously, when per- 
forming  5-fold cross validation  on 2,226 valid re- 
lation instances, we had about  1780  as training 
instances in each fold.  Now, we assume we are 
only given about 178 training instances in each 
fold.  Under this condition,  BasicRE  gives a F1 
score of 31.0 on fine-grained relations. Adding all 
the background knowledge gives an improvement 
of 7.6 and this represents an error reduction of
39% when measured against the performance dif- 
ference of 50.5 (31.0) when we have 1780 train- 
ing instances  vs.   178 training instances. On 
the coarse-grained relations, BasicRE gives a F1 
score of 51.1 and exploiting  background knowl- 
edge gives a total improvement of 5.0.

  We also tabulated the list of fine-grained re- 
lations that improved by more than 1 F1 score 
when we incorporated +Wiki, on the experiment 
using all of nwire data: phys:near (physically 
near), other-aff:ideology  (ideology affiliation), 
art:user-or-owner  (user or owner of artifact), per- 
soc:business (business relationship),  phys:part- 
whole (physical part-whole), emp-org:subsidiary 
(organization  subsidiary),  and gpe-aff:citizen-or- 
resident (citizen or resident). Most of these intu- 
itively seemed to be information  one would find 
being mentioned in an encyclopedia.


6   Related Work

Few prior work has explored using background 
knowledge to improve relation extraction perfor- 
mance. Zhou et al.  (2008) took advantage of 
the hierarchical ontology of relations by propos- 
ing methods customized for the perceptron learn- 
ing algorithm and support vector machines. In 
contrast, we propose a generic  way of using the 
relation hierarchy which at the same time, gives 
globally coherent predictions and allows for easy 
injection of knowledge  as constraints.   Recently, 
Jiang (2009) proposed using features which are 
common across all relations. Her method is com- 
plementary to our approach, as she does not con- 
sider information  such as the relatedness between 
different relations. On using semantic resources, 
Zhou et al.  (2005) gathered two gazettes,  one 
containing country names and another containing 
words indicating personal relationships. In relat- 
ing the tasks of RE and coreference resolution, Ji 
et al. (2005) used the output of a RE system to 
rescore coreference hypotheses.  In our work, we 
reverse the setting and explore using coreference 
to improve RE.

7   Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a broad range of meth- 
ods to inject background knowledge into a rela- 
tion extraction system. Some of these methods, 
such as exploiting  the relation hierarchy, are gen- 
eral in nature and could be easily applied to other 
NLP tasks.  To combine the various relation pre- 
dictions and knowledge, we perform global infer- 
ence within an ILP framework.  Besides allowing 
for easy injection of knowledge as constraints, this 
ensures globally coherent models and predictions.
