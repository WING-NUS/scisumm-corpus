			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">At least three learning paradigms have been applied to the task of extracting relational facts from text (for example, learning that a person is employed by a particular organization, or that a geographic entity is located in a particular region).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">In supervised approaches, sentences in a corpus are first hand-labeled for the presence of entities and the relations between them.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">The NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) RDC 2003 and 2004 corpora, for example, include over 1,000 documents in which pairs of entities have been labeled with 5 to 7 major relation types and 23 to 24 subrelations, totaling 16,771 relation instances.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">ACE systems then extract a wide variety of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features, and use supervised classifiers to label the relation mention holding between a given pair of entities in a test set sentence, optionally combining relation men tions (Zhou et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2007; Surdeanu and Ciaramita, 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Supervised relation extraction suffers from a number of problems, however.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Labeled training data is expensive to produce and thus limited in quantity.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Also, because the relations are labeled on a particular corpus, the resulting classifiers tend to be biased toward that text domain.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">An alternative approach, purely unsupervised information extraction, extracts strings of words between entities in large amounts of text, and clusters and simplifies these word strings to produce relation-strings (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006; Banko et al., 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Unsupervised approaches can use very large amounts of data and extract very large numbers of relations, but the resulting relations may not be easy to map to relations needed for a particular knowledge base.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">A third approach has been to use a very small number of seed instances or patterns to do bootstrap learning (Brin, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Etzioni et al., 2005; Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Rozenfeld and Feldman, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">These seeds are used with a large corpus to extract a new set of patterns, which are used to extract more instances, which are used to extract more patterns, in an iterative fashion.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">The resulting patterns often suffer from low precision and semantic drift.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">We propose an alternative paradigm, distant supervision, that combines some of the advantages of each of these approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Distant supervision is an extension of the paradigm used by Snow et al.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">(2005) for exploiting WordNet to extract hyper- nym (is-a) relations between entities, and is similar to the use of weakly labeled data in bioinformatics (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Morgan et al., 1003 Proceedings of the 47th Annual Meeting of the ACL and the 4th IJCNLP of the AFNLP, pages 1003–1011, Suntec, Singapore, 27 August 2009.</S>

			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">2004).</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Our algorithm uses Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), a large semantic database, to provide distant supervision for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Freebase contains 116 million instances of 7,300 relations between 9 million entities.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">The intuition of distant supervision is that any sentence that contains a pair of entities that participate in a known Freebase relation is likely to express that relation in some way.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">Since there may be many sentences containing a given entity pair, we can extract very large numbers of (potentially noisy) features that are combined in a logistic regression classifier.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Thus whereas the supervised training paradigm uses a small labeled corpus of only 17,000 relation instances as training data, our algorithm can use much larger amounts of data: more text, more relations, and more instances.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">We use 1.2 million Wikipedia articles and 1.8 million instances of 102 relations connecting 940,000 entities.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">In addition, combining vast numbers of features in a large classifier helps obviate problems with bad features.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">Because our algorithm is supervised by a database, rather than by labeled text, it does not suffer from the problems of overfitting and domain-dependence that plague supervised systems.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Supervision by a database also means that, unlike in unsupervised approaches, the output of our classifier uses canonical names for relations.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">Our paradigm offers a natural way of integrating data from multiple sentences to decide if a relation holds between two entities.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">Because our algorithm can use large amounts of unlabeled data, a pair of entities may occur multiple times in the test set.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">For each pair of entities, we aggregate the features from the many different sentences in which that pair appeared into a single feature vector, allowing us to provide our classifier with more information, resulting in more accurate labels.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">Table 1 shows examples of relation instances extracted by our system.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">We also use this system to investigate the value of syntactic versus lexi cal (word sequence) features in relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">While syntactic features are known to improve the performance of supervised IE, at least using clean hand-labeled ACE data (Zhou et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2005), we do not know whether syntactic features can improve the performance of unsupervised or distantly supervised IE.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">Most previous research in bootstrapping or unsupervised IE has used only simple lexical features, thereby avoiding the computational expense of parsing (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Etzioni et al., 2005), and the few systems that have used unsupervised IE have not compared the performance of these two types of feature.</S>

			<S sid ="41" ssid = "1">Except for the unsupervised algorithms discussed above, previous supervised or bootstrapping approaches to relation extraction have typically relied on relatively small datasets, or on only a small number of distinct relations.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "2">Approaches based on WordNet have often only looked at the hypernym (is-a) or meronym (part-of) relation (Girju et al., 2003; Snow et al., 2005), while those based on the ACE program (Doddington et al., 2004) have been restricted in their evaluation to a small number of relation instances and corpora of less than a million words.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "3">Many early algorithms for relation extraction used little or no syntactic information.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "4">For example, the DIPRE algorithm by Brin (1998) used string-based regular expressions in order to recognize relations such as author-book, while the SNOWBALL algorithm by Agichtein and Gravano (2000) learned similar regular expression patterns over words and named entity tags.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "5">Hearst (1992) used a small number of regular expressions over words and part-of-speech tags to find examples of the hypernym relation.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "6">The use of these patterns has been widely replicated in successful systems, for example by Etzioni et al.</S>

			<S sid ="56" ssid = "1">Following the literature, we use the term ‘relation’ to refer to an ordered, binary relation between entities.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "2">We refer to individual ordered pairs in this relation as ‘relation instances’.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "3">For example, the person-nationality relation holds between the entities named ‘John Steinbeck’ and ‘United States’, so it has (John Steinbeck, United States) as an instance.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "4">We use relations and relation instances from Freebase, a freely available online database of structured semantic data.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "5">Data in Freebase is collected from a variety of sources.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "6">One major source is text boxes and other tabular data from Wikipedia.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "7">Data is also taken from NNDB (biographical information), MusicBrainz (music), the SEC (financial and corporate data), as well as direct, wiki-style user editing.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "8">After some basic processing of the July 2008 link export to convert Freebase’s data representation into binary relations, we have 116 million instances of 7,300 relations between 9 million entities.</S>

			<S sid ="68" ssid = "1">The intuition of our distant supervision approach is to use Freebase to give us a training set of relations and entity pairs that participate in those relations.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "2">In the training step, all entities are identified in sentences using a named entity tagger that labels persons, organizations and locations.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "3">If a sentence contains two entities and those entities are an instance of one of our Freebase relations, features are extracted from that sentence and are added to the feature vector for the relation.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "4">The distant supervision assumption is that if two entities participate in a relation, any sentence that contain those two entities might express that relation.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "5">Because any individual sentence may give an incorrect cue, our algorithm trains a multiclass logistic regression classifier, learning weights for each noisy feature.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "6">In training, the features for identical tuples (relation, entity1, entity2) from different sentences are combined, creating a richer feature vector.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "7">In the testing step, entities are again identified using the named entity tagger.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "8">This time, every pair of entities appearing together in a sentence is considered a potential relation instance, and whenever those entities appear together, features are extracted on the sentence and added to a feature vector for that entity pair.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "9">For example, if a pair of entities occurs in 10 sentences in the test set, and each sentence has 3 features extracted from it, the entity pair will have 30 associated features.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "10">Each entity pair in each sentence in the test corpus is run through feature extraction, and the regression classifier predicts a relation name for each entity pair based on the features from all of the sentences in which it appeared.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "11">Consider the location-contains relation, imagining that in Freebase we had two instances of this relation: (Virginia, Richmond) and(France, Nantes).</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "12">As we encountered sen tences like ‘Richmond, the capital of Virginia’ and ‘Henry’s Edict of Nantes helped the Protestants of France’ we would extract features from these sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "13">Some features would be very useful, such as the features from the Richmond sentence, and some would be less useful, like those from the Nantes sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "14">In testing, if we came across a sentence like ‘Vienna, the capital of Austria’, one or more of its features would match those of the Richmond sentence, providing evidence that(Austria, Vienna) belongs to the location contains relation.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "15">Note that one of the main advantages of our architecture is its ability to combine information from many different mentions of the same relation.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "16">Consider the entity pair (Steven Spielberg, Saving Private Ryan) from the following two sentences, as evidence for the film-director relation.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "17">[Steven Spielberg]’s film [Saving Private Ryan] is loosely based on the brothers’ story.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "18">Allison co-produced the Academy Award winning [Saving Private Ryan], directed by [Steven Spielberg]...</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "19">The first sentence, while providing evidence for film-director, could instead be evidence for film- writer or film-producer.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "20">The second sentence does not mention that Saving Private Ryan is a film, and so could instead be evidence for the CEO relation (consider ‘Robert Mueller directed the FBI’).</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "21">In isolation, neither of these features is conclusive, but in combination, they are.</S>

	<SECTION title="Features. " number = "5">
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "1">Our features are based on standard lexical and syntactic features from the literature.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "2">Each feature describes how two entities are related in a sentence, using either syntactic or non-syntactic information.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "3">5.1 Lexical features.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "4">Our lexical features describe specific words between and surrounding the two entities in the sentence in which they appear: • The sequence of words between the two entities • The part-of-speech tags of these words • A flag indicating which entity came first in the sentence • A window of k words to the left of Entity 1 and their part-of-speech tags • A window of k words to the right of Entity 2 and their part-of-speech tags Each lexical feature consists of the conjunction of all these components.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "5">We generate a conjunctive feature for each k ∈ {0, 1, 2}.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "6">Thus each lexical row in Table 3 represents a single lexical feature.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "7">Part-of-speech tags were assigned by a maximum entropy tagger trained on the Penn Tree- bank, and then simplified into seven categories: nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, numbers, foreign words, and everything else.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "8">In an attempt to approximate syntactic features, we also tested variations on our lexical features: (1) omitting all words that are not verbs and (2) omitting all function words.</S>

			<S sid ="101" ssid = "13">In addition to lexical features we extract a number of features based on syntax.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "14">In order to generate these features we parse each sentence with the broad-coverage dependency parser MINIPAR (Lin, 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "15">A dependency parse consists of a set of words and chunks (e.g. ‘Edwin Hubble’, ‘Missouri’, ‘born’), linked by directional dependencies (e.g. ‘pred’, ‘lex-mod’), as in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "16">For each sentence we extract a dependency path between each pair of entities.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "17">A dependency path consists of a series of dependencies, directions and words/chunks representing a traversal of the parse.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "18">Part-of-speech tags are not included in the dependency path.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "19">Our syntactic features are similar to those used in Snow et al.</S>

			<S sid ="119" ssid = "31">For two features to match, all of their conjuncts must match exactly.</S>

			<S sid ="212" ssid = "124">Our results show that the distant supervision algorithm is able to extract high-precision patterns for a reasonably large number of relations.</S>
			<S sid ="213" ssid = "125">The held-out results in Figure 2 suggest that the combination of syntactic and lexical features provides better performance than either feature set on its own.</S>
			<S sid ="214" ssid = "126">In order to understand the role of syntactic features, we examine Table 5, the human evaluation of the most frequent 10 relations.</S>
			<S sid ="215" ssid = "127">For the top- ranking 100 instances of each relation, most of the best results use syntactic features, either alone or in combination with lexical features.</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "128">For the top- ranking 1000 instances of each relation, the results are more mixed, but syntactic features still helped in most classifications.</S>
			<S sid ="217" ssid = "129">We then examine those relations for which syntactic features seem to help.</S>
			<S sid ="218" ssid = "130">For example, syntactic features consistently outperform lexical fea tures for the director-film and writer-film relations.</S>
			<S sid ="219" ssid = "131">As discussed in section 4, these two relations are particularly ambiguous, suggesting that syntactic features may help tease apart difficult relations.</S>
			<S sid ="220" ssid = "132">Perhaps more telling, we noticed many examples with a long string of words between the director and the film: Back Street is a 1932 film made by Universal Pictures, directed by John M. Stahl, and produced by Carl Laemmle Jr. Sentences like this have very long (and thus rare) lexical features, but relatively short dependency paths.</S>
			<S sid ="221" ssid = "133">Syntactic features can more easily abstract from the syntactic modifiers that comprise the extraneous parts of these strings.</S>
			<S sid ="222" ssid = "134">Our results thus suggest that syntactic features are indeed useful in distantly supervised information extraction, and that the benefit of syntax occurs in cases where the individual patterns are particularly ambiguous, and where they are nearby in the dependency structure but distant in terms of words.</S>
			<S sid ="223" ssid = "135">It remains for future work to see whether simpler, chunk-based syntactic features might be able to capture enough of this gain without the overhead of full parsing, and whether coreference resolution could improve performance.</S>
