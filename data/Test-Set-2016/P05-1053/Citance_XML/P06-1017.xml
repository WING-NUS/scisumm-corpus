			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Relation extraction is the task of detecting and classifying relationships between two entities from text.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Many machine learning methods have been proposed to address this problem, e.g., supervised learning algorithms (Miller et al., 2000; Zelenko et al., 2002; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005), semi-supervised learning algorithms (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004), and unsupervised learning algorithms (Hasegawa et al., 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Supervised methods for relation extraction perform well on the ACE Data, but they require a large amount of manually labeled relation instances.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Unsupervised methods do not need the definition of relation types and manually labeled data, but they cannot detect relations between entity pairs and its result cannot be directly used in many NLP tasks since there is no relation type label attached to each instance in clustering result.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Considering both the availability of a large amount of untagged corpora and direct usage of extracted relations, semi- supervised learning methods has received great attention.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">DIPRE (Dual Iterative Pattern Relation Expansion) (Brin, 1998) is a bootstrapping-based system that used a pattern matching system as classifier to exploit the duality between sets of patterns and relations.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Snowball (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000) is another system that used bootstrap- ping techniques for extracting relations from unstructured text.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Snowball shares much in common with DIPRE, including the employment of the boot- strapping framework as well as the use of pattern matching to extract new candidate relations.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">The third system approaches relation classification problem with bootstrapping on top of SVM, proposed by Zhang (2004).</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">This system focuses on the ACE sub- problem, RDC, and extracts various lexical and syntactic features for the classification task.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">However, Zhang (2004)’s method doesn’t actually “detect” re- laitons but only performs relation classification between two entities given that they are known to be related.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Bootstrapping works by iteratively classifying unlabeled examples and adding confidently classified examples into labeled data using a model learned from augmented labeled data in previous iteration.</S>

			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Qc 2006 Association for Computational Linguistics can be found that the affinity information among unlabeled examples is not fully explored in this boot- strapping process.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Recently a promising family of semi-supervised learning algorithm is introduced, which can effectively combine unlabeled data with labeled data in learning process by exploiting manifold structure (cluster structure) in data (Belkin and Niyogi, 2002; Blum and Chawla, 2001; Blum et al., 2004; Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Zhu et al., 2003).</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">These graph-based semi-supervised methods usually define a graph where the nodes represent labeled and unlabeled examples in a dataset, and edges (may be weighted) reflect the similarity of examples.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Then one wants a labeling function to satisfy two constraints at the same time: 1) it should be close to the given labels on the labeled nodes, and 2) it should be smooth on the whole graph.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">This can be expressed in a regularization framework where the first term is a loss function, and the second term is a regularizer.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">These methods differ from traditional semi- supervised learning methods in that they use graph structure to smooth the labeling function.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">To the best of our knowledge, no work has been done on using graph based semi-supervised learning algorithms for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Here we investigate a label propagation algorithm (LP) (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) for relation extraction task.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">This algorithm works by representing labeled and unlabeled examples as vertices in a connected graph, then propagating the label information from any vertex to nearby vertices through weighted edges iteratively, finally inferring the labels of unlabeled examples after the propagation process converges.</S>

			<S sid ="28" ssid = "1">2.1 Problem Definition.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "2">The problem of relation extraction is to assign an appropriate relation type to an occurrence of two entity pairs in a given context.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "3">It can be represented as follows: R → (Cpre, e1, Cmid, e2, Cpost) (1) where e1 and e2 denote the entity mentions, and Cpre,Cmid,and Cpost are the contexts before, between and after the entity mention pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "4">In this paper, we set the mid-context window as the words between the two entity mentions and the pre- and post- context as up to two words before and after the corresponding entity mention.Let X = {xi}i=1 be a set of contexts of occurrences of all the entity mention pairs, where xi rep resents the contexts of the i-th occurrence, and n is the total number of occurrences.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "5">The first l exam ples (or contexts) are labeled as yg ( yg ∈ {rj }R , rj denotes relation type and R is the total number of relation types).</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "6">The remaining u(u = n − l) exam ples are unlabeled.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "7">Intuitively, if two occurrences of entity mention pairs have the similarity context, they tend to hold the same relation type.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "8">Based on the assumption, we define a graph where the vertices represent the contexts of labeled and unlabeled occurrences of entity mention pairs, and the edge between any two vertices xi and xj is weighted so that the closer the vertices in some distance measure, the larger the weight associated with this edge.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "9">Hence, the weights are defined as follows: s2 The rest of this paper is organized as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "10">Section 2 presents related work.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "11">Section 3 formulates Wij = exp(− ij ) (2) α2 relation extraction problem in the context of semi- supervised learning and describes our proposed approach.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "12">Then we provide experimental results of our proposed method and compare with a popular supervised learning algorithm (SVM) and bootstrap- ping algorithm in Section 4.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "13">Finally we conclude our work in section 5.</S>

			<S sid ="42" ssid = "15">In this paper, we set α as the average similarity between labeled examples from different classes.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "16">2.2 A Label Propagation Algorithm In the LP algorithm, the label information of any vertex in a graph is propagated to nearby vertices through weighted edges until a global stable stage is achieved.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "17">Larger edge weights allow labels to travel through easier.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "18">Thus the closer the examples are, the more likely they have similar labels.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "19">We define soft label as a vector that is a probabilistic distribution over all the classes.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "20">In the label propagation process, the soft label of each initial labeled example is clamped in each iteration to re plenish label sources from these labeled data.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "21">Thus Step 5 : Assign xh(l + 1 ≤ h ≤ n) with a label: yh = argmaxj Yhj . The above algorithm can ensure that the labeled data YL never changes since it is clamped in Step 3.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "22">Actually we are interested in only YU . This algorithm has been shown to converge to a unique solu U t→∞ U = (I − T¯ )− Tul YL (Zhu the labeled data act like sources to push out labels tion Yˆ = lim Y t uu 1 ¯ 0through unlabeled data.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "23">With this push from la and Ghahramani, 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "24">Here, T¯ and T¯are ac beled examples, the class boundaries will be pushed through edges with large weights and settle in gaps along edges with small weights.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "25">Hopefully, the val quired by splitting matrix T¯ after the l-th row and the l-th column into 4 sub-matrices.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "26">And I is u × u identity matrix.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "27">We can see that the initialization of 0 0 ues of Wij across different classes would be as small as possible and the values of Wij within the same class would be as large as possible.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "28">This will make label propagation to stay within the same class.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "29">This label propagation process will make the labeling function smooth on the graph.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "30">Define an n × n probabilistic transition matrix T wij YU in this solution is not important, since YU does not affect the estimation of Yˆ .</S>
