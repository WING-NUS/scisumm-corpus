			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Relation extraction is a subtask of information extraction that finds various predefined semantic relations, such as location, affiliation, rival, etc., between pairs of entities in text.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">For example, the sentence “George Bush is the president of the United States.” conveys the semantic relation “President” between the entities “George Bush” (PER) and “the United States” (GPE: a GeoPolitical Entity --- an entity with land and a government (ACE, 2004)).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Prior feature-based methods for this task (Kambhatla 2004; Zhou et al., 2005) employed a large amount of diverse linguistic features, varyingfrom lexical knowledge, entity mention informa tion to syntactic parse trees, dependency trees and semantic features.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Since a parse tree contains rich syntactic structure information, in principle, the features extracted from a parse tree should contribute much more to performance improvement for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">However it is reported (Zhou et al., 2005; Kambhatla, 2004) that hierarchical structured syntactic features contributes less to performance improvement.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">This may be mainly due to the fact that the syntactic structure information in a parse tree is hard to explicitly describe by a vector of linear features.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">As an alternative, kernel methods (Collins and Duffy, 2001) provide an elegant solution to implicitly explore tree structure features by directly computing the similarity between two trees.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">But to our surprise, the sole two-reported dependency tree kernels for relation extraction on the ACE corpus (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) showed much lower performance than the feature-based methods.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">One may ask: are the syntactic tree features very useful for relation extraction?</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Can tree kernel methods effectively capture the syntactic tree features and other various features that have been proven useful in the feature-based methods?</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the syntactic tree features for relation extraction and study how to capture such features via a convolution tree kernel.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">We also study how to select the optimal feature space (e.g. the set of sub-trees to represent relation instances) to optimize the system performance.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">The experimental results show that the convolution tree kernel plus entity features achieves slightly better performance than the previous best-reported feature-based methods.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">It also shows that our method significantly outperforms the two dependency tree kernels (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) on the 5 ACE relation types..</S>

			<S sid ="29" ssid = "5">Their results essentially depend on the entire full parse tree.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "6">Kambhatla (2004) employs Maximum Entropy models to combine diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features derived from the text for relation extraction.</S>

			<S sid ="34" ssid = "10">They report that chunking information contributes to most of the performance improvement from the syntactic aspect.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "11">The features used in Kambhatla (2004) and Zhou et al.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "12">(2005) have to be selected and carefully calibrated manually.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "13">Kambhatla (2004) use the path of non-terminals connecting two mentions in a parse tree as the parse tree features.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "14">Besides, Zhou et al.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "15">(2005) introduce additional chunking features to enhance the parse tree features.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "16">However, the hierarchical structured information in the parse trees is not well preserved in their parse tree- related features.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "17">As an alternative to the feature-based methods, kernel methods (Haussler, 1999) have been proposed to implicitly explore features in a high dimensional space by employing a kernel function to calculate the similarity between two objects directly.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "18">In particular, the kernel methods could be very effective at reducing the burden of feature engineering for structured objects in NLP research (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "19">This is because a kernel can measure the similarity between two discrete structured objects directly using the original representation of the objects instead of explicitly enumerating their features.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "20">Zelenko et al.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "21">(2003) develop a tree kernel for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "22">Their tree kernel is recursively defined in a top-down manner, matching nodes from roots to leaf nodes.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "23">For each pair of matching nodes, a subsequence kernel on their child nodes is invoked, which matches either contiguous or sparse subsequences of node.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "24">Culotta and Sorensen (2004) generalize this kernel to estimate similarity between dependency trees.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "25">One may note that their tree kernel requires the matchable nodes must be at the same depth counting from the root node.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "26">This is a strong constraint on the matching of syntax so it is not surprising that the model has good precision but very low recall on the ACE corpus (Zhao and Grishman, 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "27">In addition, according to the top-down node matching mechanism of the kernel, once a node is not matchable with any node in the same layer in another tree, all the sub-trees below this node are discarded even if some of them are matchable to their counterparts in another tree.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "28">Bunescu and Mooney (2005) propose a shortest path dependency kernel for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "29">They argue that the information to model a relationship between entities is typically captured by the shortest path between the two entities in the dependency graph.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "30">Their kernel is very straightforward.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "31">It just sums up the number of common word classes at each position in the two paths.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "32">We notice that one issue of this kernel is that they limit the two paths must have the same length, otherwise the kernel similarity score is zero.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "33">Therefore, although this kernel shows nontrivial performance improvement than that of Culotta and Sorensen (2004), the constraint makes the two dependency kernels share the similar behavior: good precision but much lower recall on the ACE corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "34">Zhao and Grishman (2005) define a feature- based composite kernel to integrate diverse features.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "35">Their kernel displays very good performance on the 2004 version of ACE corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "36">Since this is a feature-based kernel, all the features used in the kernel have to be explicitly enumerated.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "37">Similar with the feature-based method, they also represent the tree feature as a link path between two entities.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "38">Therefore, we wonder whether their performance improvement is mainly due to the explicitly incorporation of diverse linguistic features instead of the kernel method itself.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "39">The above discussion suggests that the syntactic features in a parse tree may not be fully utilized in the previous work, whether feature-based or kernel-based.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "40">We believe that the syntactic tree features could play a more important role than that reported in the previous work.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "41">Since convolution kernels aim to capture structural information in terms of substructures, which providing a viable alternative to flat features, in this paper, we propose to use a convolution tree kernel to explore syntactic features for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "42">To our knowledge, convolution kernels have not been explored for relation extraction1.</S>

			<S sid ="67" ssid = "1">In this section, we discuss the convolution tree kernel associated with different relation feature spaces.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "2">In Subsection 3.1, we define seven different relation feature spaces over parse trees.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "3">In Subsection 3.2, we introduce a convolution tree kernel for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "4">Finally we compare our method with the previous work in Subsection 3.3.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "5">3.1 Relation Feature Spaces.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "6">In order to study which relation feature spaces (i.e., which portion of parse trees) are optimal for relation extraction, we define seven different relation feature spaces as follows (as shown in Figure 1): (1) Minimum Complete Tree (MCT): It is the complete sub-tree rooted by the node of the nearest common ancestor of the two entities under consideration.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "7">(2) Path-enclosed Tree (PT): It is the smallest common sub-tree including the two entities.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "8">In other words, the sub-tree is en closed by the shortest path linking the two entities in the parse tree (this path is also typically used asthe path tree features in the feature-based meth ods).</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "9">(3) Chunking Tree (CT): It is the base phrase list extracted from the PT.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "10">We prune out all the internal structures of the PT and only keep the root node and the base phrase list for generating the chunking tree.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "11">1 Convolution kernels were proposed as a concept of kernels.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "12">for a discrete structure by Haussler (1999) in machine learning study.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "13">This framework defines a kernel between input objects by applying convolution “sub-kernels” that are the kernels for the decompositions (parts) of the objects.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "14">Convolution kernels are abstract concepts, and the instances of them are determined by the definition of “sub-kernels”.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "15">The Tree Kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001), String Subsequence Kernel (SSK) (Lodhi et al., 2002) and Graph Kernel (HDAG Kernel) (Suzuki et al., 2003) are examples of convolution kernels instances in the NLP field.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "16">(4) Context-Sensitive Path Tree (CPT): It is the PT extending with the 1st left sibling of the node of entity 1 and the 1st right sibling of the node of entity 2.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "17">If the sibling is unavailable, then we move to the parent of current node and repeat the same process until the sibling is available or the root is reached.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "18">(5) Context-Sensitive Chunking Tree (CCT): It is the CT extending with the 1st left sibling of the node of entity 1 and the 1st right sibling of the node of entity 2.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "19">If the sibling is unavailable, the same process as generating the CPT is applied.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "20">Then we do a further pruning process to guarantee that the context structures of the CCT is still a list of base phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "21">(6) Flattened PT (FPT): We define two criteria to flatten the PT in order to generate the Flattened Parse tree: if the in and out arcs of a non-terminal node (except POS node) are both single, the node is to be removed; if a node has the same phrase type with its father node, the node is also to be removed.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "22">(7) Flattened CPT (FCPT): We use the above two criteria to flatten the CPT tree to generate the Flattened CPT.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "23">Figure 1 in the next page illustrates the different sub-tree structures for a relation instance in sentence “Akyetsu testified he was powerless to stop the merger of an estimated 2000 ethnic Tutsi&apos;s in the district of Tawba.”.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "24">The relation instance is an example excerpted from the ACE corpus, where an ACE-defined relation “AT.LOCATED” exists between the entities “Tutsi&apos;s” (PER) and “district” (GPE).</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "25">We use Charniak’s parser (Charniak, 2001) to parse the example sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "26">Due to space limitation, we do not show the whole parse tree of the entire sentence here.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "27">Tree T1 in Figure 1 is the MCT of the relation instance example, where the substructure circled by a dashed line is the PT.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "28">For clarity, we redraw the PT as in T2.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "29">The only difference between the MCT and the PT lies in that the MCT does not allow the partial production rules.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "30">For instance, the most-left two-layer sub-tree [NP [DT … E1-O-PER]] in T1 is broken apart in T2.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "31">By comparing the performance of T1 and T2, we can test whether the substructures with partial production rules as in T2 will decrease performance.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "32">T3 is the CT. By comparing the performance of T2 and T3, we want to study whether the chunk- ing information or the parse tree is more effective T1): MCT T2): PT T3): CT T4):CPT T5):CCT T7):FCPT T6):FPT Figure 1.</S>

			<S sid ="105" ssid = "39">The two circled nodes in T2 are removed in the flattened trees.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "40">We want to study if the eliminated small structures are noisy features for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "41">3.2 The Convolution Tree Kernel.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "42">Given the relation instances defined in the previous section, we use the same convolution tree kernel as the parse tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001) and the semantic kernel (Moschitti, 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "43">Generally, we can represent a parse tree T by a vector of integer counts of each sub-tree type (regardless of its ancestors):φ(T ) = (# of sub-trees of type 1, …, # of sub trees of type i, …, # of sub-trees of type n) This results in a very high dimensionality since the number of different sub-trees is exponential in its size.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "44">Thus it is computational infeasible to directlyuse the feature vector φ(T ) . To solve the compu tational issue, we introduce the tree kernel function which is able to calculate the dot product between the above high dimensional vectors efficiently.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "45">The kernel function is defined as follows: K (T1 , T2 ) =&lt; φ (T1 ),φ (T2 ) &gt;= ∑i φ (T1 )[i],φ (T2 )[i] sider the entire substructure types and their occurring frequencies.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "46">In this way, on the one hand, the parse tree-related features in the flat feature set2 are embedded in the feature space of our method: “Base Phrase Chunking” and “Parse Tree” features explicitly appear as substructures of a parse = ∑ n ∈N ∑ n ∈N ∑i Ii (n1 ) ∗Ii (n2 )tree.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "47">A few of entity related features in the flat feature set are also captured by our feature space: “en where N1 and N2 are the sets of all nodes in trees T1and T2, respectively, and Ii(n) is the indicator func tion that is 1 iff a sub-tree of type i occurs with root at node n and zero otherwise.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "48">Collins and Duffy (2002) show that K (T1,T2 ) is an instance of convolution kernels over tree structures, and whichcan be computed in O(| N1 | × | N2 |) by the follow tity type” and “mention level” explicitly appear as phrase types in a parse tree.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "49">On the other hand, the other features in the flat feature set, such as “word features”, “bigram word features”, “overlap” and “dependency tree” are not contained in our feature space.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "50">From the syntactic viewpoint, the tree representation in our feature space is more robust than “Parse Tree Path” feature in the flat feature set ing recursive definitions (Let ∑i Ii (n1 ) ∗Ii (n2 ) ): ∆(n1 , n2 ) = since the path feature is very sensitive to the small changes of parse trees (Moschitti, 2004) and it also does not maintain the hierarchical information of a (1) if n1 and n2 do not have the same syntactic tag or their children are different then ∆(n1, n2 ) = 0 ; (2) else if their children are leaves (POS tags), then ∆(n1, n2 ) = 1× λ ; nc(n1 )parse tree.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "51">Due to the extensive exploration of syn tactic features by kernel, our method is expected to show better performance than the previous feature- based methods.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "52">It is also worth comparing our method with the previous relation kernels.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "53">Since our method only (3) else ∆(n1, n2 ) = λ ∏ (1+∆(ch(n 1, j), ch(n2 , j))) , j = 1 counts the occurre nce of each sub-tree without conside ring its ancestor s, our method is not limited where nc(n1 ) is the number of the children of n1 , by the constraints in Culotta and Sorensen (2004) ch(n, j) is the jth child of node n and and that in Bunescu and Mooney (2005) as dis λ ( 0 &lt; λ &lt; 1) is the decay factor in order to make the kernel value less variable with respect to the tree sizes.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "54">3.3 Comparison with Previous Work.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "55">It would be interesting to review the differences between our method and the feature-based methods.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "56">The basic difference between them lies in the relation instance representation and the similarity calculation mechanism.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "57">A relation instance in our method is represented as a parse tree while it is represented as a vector of features in the feature- based methods.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "58">Our method estimates the similarity between two relation instances by only counting the number of substructures that are in common while the feature methods calculate the dot-product between the feature vectors directly.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "59">The main difference between them is the different feature spaces.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "60">By the kernel method, we implicitly represent a parse tree by a vector of integer counts of each substructure type.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "61">That is to say, we con cussed in Section 2.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "62">Compared with Zhao and Grishman’s kernel, our method directly uses the original representation of a parse tree while they flatten a parse tree into a link and a path.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "63">Given the above improvements, our method is expected to outperform the previous relation kernels.</S>
