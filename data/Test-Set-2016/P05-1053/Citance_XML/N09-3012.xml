			<S sid ="26" ssid = "1">In (Collins and Duffy, 2001), a convolution parse tree kernel has been introduced.</S>

			<S sid ="30" ssid = "5">Since the number of sub-trees of a tree is exponential in its size (Collins and Duffy, 2001), direct inner product calculation is computationally infeasible.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "6">Consequently, Collins and Duffy (2001) proposed an ingenious kernel function that implicitly between parse trees and is especially exploited for parsing English sentences in their paper.</S>

			<S sid ="42" ssid = "17">Samples of sub-trees used in convolution tree kernel calculation.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "18">Since each node of the whole syntactic tree can either happen as an internal node or as an external node of a supposed sub-tree (presuming its existence in the sub-tree), two types of weights are respectively associated to each node by the different production rules they can&apos;t accordingly have any sub-trees in common.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "19">In the second case, there is exactly one common sub-tree of size two.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "20">It should be noted that all the leaf nodes of the tree (or words of the sentence) are considered identical in the calculation of the tree kernel.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "21">The value of the function in this case is the weight of this common sub-tree.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "22">In the third case, when the nodes functions inw(n) and enw(n) (which respectivel y generally represent the same productio n rules the stand for &quot;internal node weight&quot; and &quot;external node weight&quot;).</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "23">For instance, in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "24">1, the node with label PP is an external node for sub-trees (1) and (7) while it is an internal node of sub-trees (3) and (4).</S>

			<S sid ="51" ssid = "26">The equation holds because the existence of common sub-trees rooted at n1 and n2 implies the existence of common sub trees rooted at their corresponding children, which can be combined multiplicatively to form their parents&apos; common sub-trees.</S>

			<S sid ="53" ssid = "28">It is worthy of note that in (Moschitti, 2006b) a sorting n1∈T1 n2∈T2 i tw(subTre ei (n1 )) × tw(subTre ei (n2 ))] based method is proposed for the fast implementation of such tree kernels that reduces = ∑ ∑Cgc (n1 , n2 ) n1∈T1 n2∈T2 the average running time to O( N1 + N2 ) . As shown in eq.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "29">(5), A similar procedure to The generalized kernel can be converted to (Collins and Duffy, 2001) can be employed to CD’01 kernel by defining inw(n) = λ and develop a kernel function for the calculation of dot products on H(T) vectors.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "30">According to eq.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "31">(5) the calculation of the kernel finally leads to the sum of enw(n) = 1 . Likewise, other definitions can be utilized to produce other useful sub-kernels.</S>

			<S sid ="83" ssid = "58">For every relation type the best result is shown in bold font.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "59">We have used LIBSVM (Chang and Lin 2001) java source for the SVM classification and Stanford NLP package1 for tokenization, sentence segmentation and parsing.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "60">Following [Bunescu and Mooney, 2007], every pair of entities within a sentence is regarded as a negative relation instance unless it is annotated as a positive relation in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "61">The total number of negative training instances, constructed in this way, is about 20 times more than the number of annotated positive instances.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "62">Thus, we also imposed the restriction of maximum argument distance of 10 words.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "63">This constraint eliminates half of the negative constructed instances while slightly decreases positive instances.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "64">Nevertheless, since the resulted training set is still unbalanced, we used LIBSVM weighting mechanism.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "65">Precisely, if there are P positive and N negative instances in the training set, a weight value of except for AAP are computed on the PT portion described in section 2.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "66">AAP is computed over the MCT tree portion which is also proposed by (Zhang et al., 2006a) and is the sub-tree rooted at the first common ancestor of relation arguments.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "67">For the proposed kernels α is set to 0.44 which is tuned on a development set that contained 5000 instances of type PHYS.</S>

			<S sid ="94" ssid = "69">The C parameter of SVM classification is set to 2.4 for all the kernels after tuning it individually for each kernel on the mentioned development set.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "70">6.2 Experiments Results.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "71">The results of the experiments are shown in Table 1.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "72">The proposed kernels outperform the original.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "73">CD’01 kernel in four of the six relation types.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "74">The N / P is used for positiv e instan ces while the perfor manc e of TSAAPD1 is especially default weight value of 1 is used for negative ones.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "75">A binary SVM is trained for every relation type separately, and type compatible annotated and constructed relation instances are used to train it.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "76">For each relation type, only type compatible relation instances are exploited for training.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "77">For example to learn an ORGAFF relation (which applies to (PER, ORG) or (ORG, ORG) argument types) it is meaningless to use a relation instance between two entities of type PERSON.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "78">Moreover, the total number of training instances used for training every relation type is restricted to 5000 instances to shorten the duration of the evaluation process.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "79">The reported results are achieved using a 5-fold cross validation method.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "80">The kernels AAP, AAPD and TSAAPD0 (TSAAPD with threshold = 0) and TSAAPD1 (TSAAPD with threshold = 1) are compared with CD’01 convolution tree kernel.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "81">All the kernels 1 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/index.shtmlremarkable because it is the best kernel in ORG AFF and PER-SOC relations.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "82">It particularly performs very well in the extraction of PER-SOC relation with an F1-measure of 0.73.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "83">It should be noted that the general low performance of all the kernels on the GENAFF type is because of its extremely small number of annotated instances in the training set (40 in 5000).</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "84">The AAPD kernel has the best performance with a remarkable improvement over the Collins kernel in GENAFF relation type.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "85">The results clearly demonstrate that the nodes closer to the ancestor path of relation arguments contain the most useful syntactic features for relation extraction 7 Conclusion.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "86">In this paper, we proposed a generalized convolution tree kernel that can generate various syntactic sub-kernels including the CD’01 kernel.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "87">The kernel is generalized by assigning weights to the sub-trees.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "88">The weight of a sub-tree is the product of the weights assigned to its nodes by two types of weighting functions.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "89">In this way, impacts of the tree nodes on the kernel value can be discriminated purposely based on the application.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "90">Context information can also be injected to the kernel via context sensitive weighting mechanisms.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "91">Using the generalized kernel, various sub- kernels can be produced by different definitions of the two weighting functions.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "92">We consequently used the generalized kernel for systematic generation of useful kernels in relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "93">In these kernels, the closer a node is to the relation arguments ancestor paths, the less it is decayed by the weighting functions.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "94">Evaluation on the ACE 2005 main relation types demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed kernels.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "95">They show remarkable performance improvement over CD’01 kernel.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "96">8 Future Work.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "97">Although the path-enclosed tree portion (PT) (Zhang et al., 2006a) seems to be an appropriate portion of the syntactic tree for relation extraction, it only takes into account the syntactic information between the relation arguments, and discards many useful features (before and after the arguments features).</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "98">It seems that the generalized kernel can be used with larger tree portions that contain syntactic features before and after the arguments, because it can be more easily targeted to related features.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "99">Currently, the proposed weighting mechanisms are solely based on the location of the tree nodes in the parse tree; however other useful information such as labels of nodes can also be used in weighting.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "100">Another future work can be utilizing the generalized kernel for other applicable NLP tasks such as co-reference resolution.</S>
