			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Due to limited accuracy in state-of-the-art syntactic and semantic parsing, reliably extracting semantic relationships between named entities in natural language documents is still a difficult, unresolved problem.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">In the literature, feature-based methods have dominated the research in semantic relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Featured-based methods achieve promising performance and competitive efficiency by transforming a relation example into a set of syntactic and semantic features, such as lexical knowledge, entity-related information, syntactic parse trees and deep semantic information.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">However, detailed research (Zhou et al., 2005) shows that it’s difficult to extract new effective features to further improve the extraction accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Therefore, researchers turn to kernel-based methods, which avoids the burden of feature engineering through computing the similarity of two discrete objects (e.g. parse trees) directly.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">From prior work (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) to current research (Zhang et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007), kernel methods have been showing more and more potential in relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">The key problem for kernel methods on relation extraction is how to represent and capture the structured syntactic information inherent in relation instances.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">While kernel methods using the dependency tree (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and the shortest dependency path (Bunescu andMooney, 2005) suffer from low recall perform ance, convolution tree kernels (Zhang et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007) over syntactic parse trees achieve comparable or even better performance than feature-based methods.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">However, there still exist two problems regarding currently widely used tree spans.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Zhang et al.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">(2006) discover that the Shortest Path 697 Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2008), pages 697–704 Manchester, August 2008 enclosed Tree (SPT) achieves the best performance.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">Zhou et al.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">(2007) further extend it to Context-Sensitive Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (CS- SPT), which dynamically includes necessary predicate-linked path information.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">One problem with both SPT and CS-SPT is that they may still contain unnecessary information.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">The other problem is that a considerable number of useful context-sensitive information is also missing from SPT/CS-SPT, although CS-SPT includes some contextual information relating to predicate- linked path.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">This paper proposes a new approach to dynamically determine the tree span for relation extraction by exploiting constituent dependencies to remove the noisy information, as well as keep the necessary information in the parse tree.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">Our motivation is to integrate dependency information, which has been proven very useful to relation extraction, with the structured syntactic information to construct a concise and effective tree span specifically targeted for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Moreover, we also explore interesting combined entity features for relation extraction via a unified parse and semantic tree.</S>

			<S sid ="38" ssid = "4">Zelenko et al.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "5">(2003) described a kernel between shallow parse trees to extract semantic relations, where a relation instance is transformed into the least common sub-tree connecting the two entity nodes.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "6">The kernel matches the nodes of two corresponding sub-trees from roots to leaf nodes recursively layer by layer in a top- down manner.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "7">Their method shows successful results on two simple extraction tasks.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "8">Culotta and Sorensen (2004) proposed a slightly generalized version of this kernel between dependency trees, in which a successful match of two relation instances requires the nodes to be at the same layer and in the identical path starting from the roots to the current nodes.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "9">These strong constraints make their kernel yield high precision but very low recall on the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "10">Bunescu and Mooney (2005) develop a shortest path dependency tree kernel, which simply counts the number of common word classes at each node in the shortest paths between two entities in dependency trees.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "11">Similar to Culotta and Sorensen (2004), this method also suffers from high precision but low recall.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "12">Zhang et al.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "13">(2006) describe a convolution tree kernel (CTK, Collins and Duffy, 2001) to investigate various structured information for relation extraction and find that the Shortest Path- enclosed Tree (SPT) achieves the F-measure of 67.7 on the 7 relation types of the ACE RDC 2004 corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "14">One problem with SPT is that it loses the contextual information outside SPT, which is usually critical for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "15">Zhou et al.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "16">(2007) point out that both SPT and the convolution tree kernel are context-free.</S>

			<S sid ="52" ssid = "18">However, the CS-SPT only recovers part of contextual information and may contain noisy information as much as SPT.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "19">In order to fully utilize the advantages of feature-based methods and kernel-based methods, researchers turn to composite kernel methods.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "20">Zhao and Grishman (2005) define several feature-based composite kernels to capture diverse linguistic knowledge and achieve the F-measure of 70.4 on the 7 relation types in the ACE RDC 2004 corpus.</S>

	<SECTION title="Dynamic Syntactic Parse Tree. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "1">This section discusses how to generate dynamic syntactic parse tree by employing constituent dependencies to overcome the problems existing in currently used tree spans.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "2">3.1 Constituent Dependencies in Parse Tree.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "3">Zhang et al.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "4">(2006) explore five kinds of tree spans and find that the Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT) achieves the best performance.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "5">Zhou et al.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "6">(2007) further propose Context-Sensitive SPT (CS-SPT), which can dynamically determine the tree span by extending the necessary predicate-linked path information outside SPT.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "7">However, the key problem of how to represent the structured syntactic parse tree is still partially resolved.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "8">As we indicate as follows, current tree spans suffer from two problems: (1) Both SPT and CS-SPT still contain unnecessary information.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "9">For example, in the sentence “…bought one of town’s two meat-packing plants”, the condensed information “one of plants” is sufficient to determine “DISC” relationship between the entities “one” [FAC] and “plants” [FAC], while SPT/CS-SPT include the redundant underlined part.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "10">Therefore more unnecessary information can be safely removed from SPT/CS-SPT.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "11">(2) CS-SPT only captures part of context- sensitive information relating to predicate-linked structure (Zhou et al., 2007) and still loses much context-sensitive information.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "12">Let’s take the same example sentence “…bought one of town’s two meat-packing plants”, where indeed there is no relationship between the entities “one” [FAC] and “town” [GPE].</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "13">Nevertheless, the information contained in SPT/CS-SPT (“one of town”) may easily lead to their relationship being misclassified as “DISC”, which is beyond our expectation.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "14">Therefore the underlined part outside SPT/CS- SPT should be recovered so as to differentiate it from positive instances.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "15">Since dependency plays a key role in many NLP problems such as syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling as well as semantic relation extraction, our motivation is to exploit dependency knowledge to distinguish the necessary evidence from the unnecessary information in the structured syntactic parse tree.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "16">On one hand, lexical or word-word dependency indicates the relationship among words occurring in the same sentence, e.g. predicate- argument dependency means that arguments are dependent on their target predicates, modifier head dependency means that modifiers are dependent on their head words.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "17">This dependency relationship offers a very condensed representation of the information needed to assess the relationship in the forms of the dependency tree (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) or the shortest dependency path (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) that includes both entities.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "18">On the other hand, when the parse tree corresponding to the sentence is derived using derivation rules from the bottom to the top, the word- word dependencies extend upward, making a unique head child containing the head word for every non-terminal constituent.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "19">As indicated as follows, each CFG rule has the form: P Æ Ln…L1 H R1…Rm Here, P is the parent node, H is the head child of the rule, Ln…L1 and R1…Rm are left and right modifiers of H respectively, and both n and m may be zero.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "20">In other words, the parent node P depends on the head child H, this is what we call constituent dependency.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "21">Vice versa, we can also determine the head child of a constituent in terms of constituent dependency.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "22">Our hypothesis stipulates that the contribution of the parse tree to establishing a relationship is almost exclusively concentrated in the path connecting the two entities, as well as the head children of constituent nodes along this path.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "23">3.2 Generation of Dynamic Syntactic Parse.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "24">Tree Starting from the Minimum Complete Tree (MCT, the complete sub-tree rooted by the nearest common ancestor of the two entities under consideration) as the representation of each relation instance, along the path connecting two entities, the head child of every node is found according to various constituent dependencies.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "25">Then the path nodes and their head children are kept while any other nodes are removed from the tree.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "26">Eventually we arrive at a tree called Dynamic Syntactic Parse Tree (DSPT), which is dynamically determined by constituent dependencies and only contains necessary information as expected.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "27">There exist a considerable number of constituent dependencies in CFG as described by Collins (2003).</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "28">However, since our task is to extract the relationship between two named entities, our focus is on how to condense Noun-Phrases (NPs) and other useful constituents for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "29">Therefore constituent dependencies can be classified according to constituent types of the CFG rules: (1) Modification within base-NPs: base-NPs mean that they do not directly dominate an NP themselves, unless the dominated NP is a possessive NP.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "30">The noun phrase right above the entity headword, whose mention type is nominal or name, can be categorized into this type.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "31">In this case, the entity headword is also the headword of the noun phrase, thus all the constituents before the headword are dependent on the headword, and may be removed from the parse tree, while the headword and the constituents right after the headword remain unchanged.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "32">For example, in the sentence “…bought one of town’s two meat- packing plants” as illustrated in Figure 1(a), the constituents before the headword “plants” can be removed from the parse tree.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "33">In this way the parse tree “one of plants” could capture the “DISC” relationship more concisely and precisely.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "34">Another interesting example is shown in Figure 1(b), where the base-NP of the second entity “town” is a possessive NP and there is no relationship between the entities “one” and “town” defined in the ACE corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "35">For both SPT and CS-SPT, this example would be condensed to “one of town” and therefore easily misclassified as the “DISC” relationship between the two entities.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "36">In the contrast, our DSPT can avoid this problem by keeping the constituent “’s” and the headword “plants”.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "37">(2) Modification to NPs: except base-NPs, other modification to NPs can be classified into this type.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "38">Usually these NPs are recursive, meaning that they contain another NP as their child.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "39">The CFG rules corresponding to these modifications may have the following forms: NP Æ NP SBAR [relative clause] NP Æ NP VP [reduced relative] NP Æ NP PP [PP attachment] Here, the NPs in bold mean that the path connecting the two entities passes through them.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "40">For every right hand side, the NP in bold is modified by the constituent following them.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "41">That is, the latter is dependent on the former, and may be reduced to a single NP.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "42">In Figure 1(c) we show a sentence “one of about 500 people nominated for …”, where there exists a “DISC” relationship between the entities “one” and “people”.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "43">Since the reduced relative “nominated for …” modifies and is therefore dependent on the “people”, they can be removed from the parse tree, that is, the right side (“NP VP”) can be reduced to the left hand side, which is exactly a single NP.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "44">NP PP NP NP NP NP PP NP NP NP PP NP NP NP NP PP VP NP NP E1FAC E-GPE E1FACE2-FAC E1 PER QP E2-PER E1-PER E2-PER NN DT NN CD JJ NN NN NN IN RB CD NNS NN NNS one the town two meat-packing one plants one of about 500 people one people (a) Removal of constituents before the headword in base-NP (c) Reduction of modification to NP NP E1-PER NP P P N P NP E 2 G P E E-FAC NP E1FAC NP PP NP E2 GPE NP E-FAC NP S B A R S VP PP NP SBAR S NN IN DT NN POS CD JJ NN NN IN NN POS NN NP NP NP NP NP one of the town &apos;s two meat-packing plants one of town &apos;s plants E1FAC E2-PER NP E1FAC E2-PER VP (b) Keeping of constituents after the headword in base-NP JJ NN PRP VBZ IN DT NNS NN PRP VBZ rental NP property he owns in the state property he owns PP NP NP PP (d) Removal of arguments to verb NP NP NP NP NP NP E1-PER E-GPE E-GPE E2GPE E1-PER E2GPE NNS IN NNP , NNP NNP , CC NNP NNS IN NNP governors from connecticut , south dakota , and montana governors from montana (e) Reduction of conjuncts for NP coordination Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "45">Removal and reduction of constituents using dependencies (3) Arguments/adjuncts to verbs: this type includes the CFG rules in which the left side includes S, SBAR or VP.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "46">An argument represents the subject or object of a verb, while an adjunct indicates the location, date/time or way of the action corresponding to the verb.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "47">They depend on the verb and can be removed if they are not included in the path connecting the two entities.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "48">However, when the parent tag is S or SBAR, and its child VP is not included in the path, this VP should be recovered to indicate the predicate verb.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "49">Figure 1(d) shows a sentence “… maintain rental property he owns in the state”, where the “ART.User-or-Owner” relation holds between the entities “property” and “he”.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "50">While PP can be removed from the rule (“VPÆ VBZ PP”), the VP should be kept in the rule (“SÆ NP VP”).</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "51">Consequently, the tree span looks more concise and precise for relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "52">(4) Coordination conjunctions: In coordination constructions, several peer conjuncts may be reduced into a single constituent.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "53">Although the first conjunct is always considered as the headword (Collins, 2003), actually all the conjuncts play an equal role in relation extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "54">As illus trated in Figure 1(e), the NP coordination in the Qian et al.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "55">(2007) further indicates that among these entity features, entity type, subtype, and mention type, as well as the base form of predicate verb, contribute most while the contribution of other features, such as entity class, headword and GPE role, can be ignored.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "56">In order to effectively capture entity-related semantic features, and their combined features as well, especially bi-gram or tri-gram features, we build an Entity-related Semantic Tree (EST) in three ways as illustrated in Figure 2.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "57">In the example sentence “they ’re here”, which is excerpted from the ACE RDC 2004 corpus, there exists a relationship “Physical.Located” between the entities “they” [PER] and “here” [GPE.Population-Center].</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "58">The features are encoded as “TP”, “ST”, “MT” and “PVB”, which denote type, subtype, mention-type of the two entities, and the base form of predicate verb if existing (nearest to the 2nd entity along the path connecting the two entities) respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "59">For example, the tag “TP1” represents the type of the 1st entity, and the tag “ST2” represents the sub- type of the 2nd entity.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "60">The three entity-related semantic tree setups are depicted as follows: ENT sentence (“governors from connecticut, south TP1 ST1 MT1 TP2 ST2 MT2 PVB dakota, and montana”) can be reduced to a single NP (“governors from montana”) by keeping the conjunct in the path while removing the other conjuncts.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "61">PER null PRO GPE Pop.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "62">PRO be (a) Bag Of Features(BOF) ENT (5) Modification to other constituents: except for the above four types, other CFG rules fall into this type, such as modification to PP, ADVP and PRN etc. These cases are similar to arguments/adjuncts to verbs, but less frequent than them, so we will not detail this scenario.In fact, SPT (Zhang et al., 2006) can be ar TP ST MT TP1 TP2 ST1 ST2 MT1 MT2 PER GPE null Pop.</S>

	<SECTION title="Conclusion. " number = "6">
			<S sid ="188" ssid = "1">This paper further explores the potential of structured syntactic information for tree kernel-based relation extraction, and proposes a new approach to dynamically determine the tree span (DSPT) for relation instances by exploiting constituent dependencies.</S>
			<S sid ="189" ssid = "2">We also investigate different ways of how entity-related semantic features and their combined features can be effectively captured in a Unified Parse and Semantic Tree (UPST).</S>
			<S sid ="190" ssid = "3">Evaluation on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus shows that our DSPT is appropriate for structured representation of relation instances.</S>
			<S sid ="191" ssid = "4">We also find that, in addition to individual entity features, combined entity features (especially bi-gram) contribute much when they are combined with a DPST into a UPST.</S>
			<S sid ="192" ssid = "5">And the composite kernel, combining the UPST kernel and a linear state-of- the-art kernel, yields the so far best performance.</S>
			<S sid ="193" ssid = "6">For the future work, we will focus on improving performance of complex structured parse trees, where the path connecting the two entities involved in a relationship is too long for current kernel methods to take effect.</S>
			<S sid ="194" ssid = "7">Our preliminary experiment of applying certain discourse theory exhibits certain positive results.</S>
