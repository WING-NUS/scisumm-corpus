			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Recent studies on relation extraction have shown that supervised approaches based on either feature or kernel methods achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (Zelenko et al., 2002; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; ∗ The first author was affiliated with the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering of the University of Trento (Povo, Italy) during the design of the models, experiments and writing of the paper.</S>

			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">However, the clear drawback of supervised methods is the need of training data, which can slow down the delivery of commercial applications in new domains: labeled data is expensive to obtain, and there is often a mismatch between the training data and the data the system will be applied to.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Approaches that can cope with domain changes are essential.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">This is the problem of domain adaptation (DA) or transfer learning (TL).</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Technically, domain adaptation addresses the problem of learning when the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples is violated.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Domain adaptation has been studied extensively during the last couple of years for various NLP tasks, e.g. two shared tasks have been organized on domain adaptation for dependency parsing (Nivre et al., 2007; Petrov and McDonald, 2012).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Results were mixed, thus it is still a very active research area.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">However, to the best of our knowledge, there is almost no work on adapting relation extraction (RE) systems to new domains.1 There are some prior studies on the related tasks of multi-task transfer learning (Xu et al., 2008; Jiang, 2009) and distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009), which are clearly related but different: the former is the problem of how to transfer knowledge from old to new relation types, while distant supervision tries to learn new relations from unlabeled text by exploiting weak-supervision in the form of a knowledge resource (e.g. Freebase).</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">We assume the same relation types but a shift in the underlying 1 Besides an unpublished manuscript of a student project, but it is not clear what data was used.</S>

			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Weak supervision is a promising approach to improve a relation extraction system, especially to increase its coverage in terms of types of relations covered.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">In this paper we examine the related issue of changes in the underlying data distribution, while keeping the relations fixed.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">Even a weakly supervised system is expected to perform well when applied to any kind of text (other domain/genre), thus ideally, we believe that combining domain adaptation with weak supervision is the way to go in the future.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">This study is a first step towards this.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">We focus on unsupervised domain adaptation, i.e. no labeled target data.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Moreover, we consider a particular domain adaptation setting: single- system DA, i.e. learning a single system able to cope with different but related domains.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Most studies on DA so far have focused on building a specialized system for every specific target domain, e.g. Blitzer et al.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">(2006).</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">In contrast, the goal here is to build a single system that can robustly handle several domains, which is in line with the setup of the recent shared task on parsing the web (Petrov and McDonald, 2012).</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Participants were asked to build a single system that can robustly parse all domains (reviews, weblogs, answers, emails, newsgroups), rather than to build several domain-specific systems.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">We consider this as a shift in what was considered domain adaptation in the past (adapt from source to a specific target) and what can be considered a somewhat different recent view of DA, that became widespread since 2011/2012.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">The latter assumes that the target domain(s) is/are not really known in advance.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">In this setup, the domain adaptation problem boils “US”, are terms indicating an employment relation between a person and a location.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Rather than only matching the surface string of words, lexical similarity enables soft matches between similar words in convolution tree kernels.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">In the empirical evaluation on Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) data, we evaluate the impact of convolution tree kernels embedding lexical semantic similarities.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">The latter is derived in two ways with: (a) Brown word clustering (Brown et al., 1992); and (b) Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">We first show that our system aligns well with the state of the art on the ACE 2004 benchmark.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">Then, we test our RE system on the ACE 2005 data, which exploits kernels, structures and similarities for domain adaptation.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">The results show that combining the huge space of tree fragments generalized at the lexical level provides an effective model for adapting RE systems to new domains.</S>

			<S sid ="53" ssid = "15">However, if two trees have similar substructures that employ different though related terminal nodes, they will not be matched.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "16">This is clearly a limitation.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "17">For instance, the fragments corresponding to governor from Texas and head of Maryland are intuitively semantically related and should obtain a higher match when compared to mother of them.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "18">Semantic syntactic tree kernels (Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007a; Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007b; Croce et al., 2011) provide one way to address this problem by introducing similarity σ that allows soft matches between words and, consequently, between fragments containing them.</S>

			<S sid ="62" ssid = "24">These correspondences are then integrated as new features in the labeled data of the source domain.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "25">The key to SCL is to exploit pivot features to automatically identify feature correspondences, and as such is applicable to feature-based approaches but not in our case since we do not assume availability of target domain data.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "26">Instead, we apply a similar idea where we exploit an entire unlabeled corpus as pivot, and compare our approach to instance weighting (Jiang and Zhai, 2007).</S>

			<S sid ="85" ssid = "8">Therefore, our BOW kernel can be considered an enriched BOW model.</S>

			<S sid ="90" ssid = "13">However, in a realistic setting this information is not available or noisy.</S>

			<S sid ="92" ssid = "15">In the case of porting a system to new domains entity information will be unreliable or missing.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "16">Therefore, in our domain adaptation experiments on the ACE 2005 data (Section 6.3) we will not rely on this gold information but rather train a system using PET (target mentions only marked with E1/E2 and no gold entity label).3 4.1 Syntactic Semantic Structures.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "17">Combining syntax with semantics has a clear ad allow the system to perform better in the target domain.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "18">The question remains how to establish a link between the semantic similarity in the source and target domain.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "19">We propose to use an entire unlabeled corpus as pivot: this corpus must be general enough to encapsulate the source and target domains of interest.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "20">The idea is to (i) learn semantic similarity between words on the pivot corpus and (ii) use tree kernels embedding such a similarity to learn a RE system on the source, which allows to generalize to the new target domain.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "21">This reasoning is related to Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL) (Blitzer et al., 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "22">In SCL, a representation shared across domains is learned by exploiting pivot features, where a set of pivot features has to be selected (usually a few thousands).</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "23">In our case pivots are words that co- occur with the target words in a large unlabeled corpus and are thus implicitly represented in the similarity matrix.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "24">Thus, in contrast to SCL, we do not need to select a set of pivot features but rather rely on the distributional hypothesis to infer a semantic similarity from a large unlabeled corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "25">Then, this similarity is incorporated into the tree kernel that provides the necessary restriction for an effective semantic similarity calculation.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "26">One peculiarity of our work is that we exploit a large amount of general data, i.e. data gathered from the web, which is a different but also more challenging scenario than the general unsupervised DA setting where domain specific data is available.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "27">We study two ways for term generalization in tree kernels: Brown words clusters and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), both briefly described next.</S>

			<S sid ="159" ssid = "2">Although most prior studies performed 5-fold cross-validation on ACE 2004, it is often not clear whether the partitioning has been done on the instance or on the document level.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "3">Moreover, it is often not stated whether argument order is modeled explicitly, making it difficult to compare system performance.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "4">Citing Wang (2008), “We feel that there is a sense of increasing confusion down this line of research”.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "5">To ease comparison for future research we use the same 5-fold split on the document level as Sun et al.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "6">(2011)13 and make our system publicly available (see Section 5).</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "7">Table 3 shows that our system (bottom) aligns well with the state of the art.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "8">Our best system (composite kernel with polynomial expansion) reaches an F1 of 70.1, which aligns well to the 70.4 of Sun et al.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "9">(2011) that use the same data- split.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "10">This is slightly behind that of Zhang (2006); the reason might be threefold: i) different data partitioning; ii) different pre-processing; iii) they incorporate features from additional sources, i.e. a phrase chunker, dependency parser and semantic resources (Zhou et al., 2005) (we have on average 9 features/instance, they use 40).</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "11">Since we focus on evaluating the impact of semantic similarity in tree kernels, we think our system is very competitive.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "12">Removing gold entity and mention 12 Other weightings/normalizations (like LDA) didn’t improve the results; best was to take the posteriors and add c. 13 http://cs.nyu.edu/˜asun/pub/ACL11_CVFileList.txt information results in a significant F1 drop from 66.3% to 54.2%.</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "13">However, in a realistic setting we do not have gold entity info available, especially not in the case when we apply the system to any kind of text.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "14">Thus, in the domain adaptation setup we assume entity boundaries given but not their label.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "15">Clearly, evaluating the approach on predicted mentions, e.g. Giuliano et al.</S>

			<S sid ="175" ssid = "18">To evaluate the effectiveness of Brown word clusters in tree kernels, we evaluated different instance representations (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "19">Figure 2) on the ACE 2005 development set.</S>
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "20">Table 4 shows the results.</S>

			<S sid ="179" ssid = "22">Fig 2).</S>
			<S sid ="180" ssid = "23">To summarize, we found: i) it is generally a bad idea to dismiss lexical information completely, i.e. replacing or ignoring terminals harms performance; ii) the best way to incorporate Brown clusters is to replace the Pos tag with the cluster bit- string; iii) marking all words is generally better than only mentions; this is in contrast to Sun et al.</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "24">(2011) who found that in their feature-based system it was better to add cluster information to entity mentions only.</S>
			<S sid ="182" ssid = "25">As we will discuss, the combination of syntax and semantics exploited in this novel kernel avoids the necessity of restricting cluster information to mentions only.</S>
			<S sid ="183" ssid = "26">6.3 Semantic Tree Kernels for DA.</S>
			<S sid ="184" ssid = "27">To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed kernels across domains, we use the ACE 2005 data as testbed.</S>
			<S sid ="185" ssid = "28">Following standard practices on ACE 2004, the newswire (nw) and broadcast news (bn) data from ACE 2005 are considered training data (labeled source domain).</S>
			<S sid ="186" ssid = "29">The test data consists of three targets: broadcast conversation, telephone conversation, weblogs.</S>
			<S sid ="187" ssid = "30">As we want to build a single system that is able to handle heterogeneous data, we do not assume that there is further unla beled domain-specific data, but we assume to have a large unlabeled corpus (ukWaC) at our disposal to improve the generalizability of our models.</S>
			<S sid ="188" ssid = "31">Table 5 presents the results.</S>
			<S sid ="189" ssid = "32">In the first three rows we see the performance of the baseline models (PET, BOW and BOW without marking).</S>
			<S sid ="190" ssid = "33">In-domain (col 1): when evaluated on the same domain the system was trained on (nw+bn, 5-fold cross-validation).</S>
			<S sid ="191" ssid = "34">Out-of-domain performance (cols 24): the system evaluated on the targets, namely broadcast conversation (bc), telephone conversation (cts) and weblogs (wl).</S>
			<S sid ="192" ssid = "35">While the system achieves a performance of 46.0 F1 within its own domain, the performance drops to 45.3, 43.4 and 34.0 F1 on the target domains, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="193" ssid = "36">The BOW kernel that disregards syntax is often less effective (row 2).</S>
			<S sid ="194" ssid = "37">We see also the effect of target entity marking: the BOW kernel without entity marking performs substantially worse (row 3).</S>
			<S sid ="195" ssid = "38">For the remaining experiments we use the BOW kernel with entity marking.</S>
			<S sid ="196" ssid = "39">Rows 4 and 5 of Table 5 show the effect of using instance weighting for the PET baseline.</S>
			<S sid ="197" ssid = "40">Two models are shown: they differ in whether PET or BOW was used as instance representation for training the discriminative classifier.</S>
			<S sid ="198" ssid = "41">Instance weighting shows mixed results: it helps slightly on the weblogs domain, but does not help on broadcast conversation and telephone conversations.</S>
			<S sid ="199" ssid = "42">Interestingly, the two models used to obtain the weights perform similarly, despite the fact that their performance differs (F1: 70.5 BOW, 73.5 PET); it turns out that the correlation between the weights is high (+0.82).</S>
			<S sid ="200" ssid = "43">The next part (rows 69) shows the effect of enriching the syntactic structures with either Brown word clusters or LSA.</S>
			<S sid ="201" ssid = "44">The Brown cluster kernel applied to PET (P WC) improves performance over the baseline over all target domains.</S>
			<S sid ="202" ssid = "45">The same holds also for the lexical semantic kernel based on LSA (P LSA), however, to only two out of three domains.</S>
			<S sid ="203" ssid = "46">This suggests that the two kernels capture different information and a combined kernel might be effective.</S>
			<S sid ="204" ssid = "47">More importantly, the table shows the effect of adding Brown clusters or LSA semantics to the BOW kernel: it can actually hurt performance, sometimes to a small but other times to a considerably degree.</S>
			<S sid ="205" ssid = "48">For instance, WC applied to PET achieves an F1 of 47.0 (baseline: 45.3) on the bc domain, while applied to BOW it hurts performance significantly, i.e. it drops from n w + b n ( i n d o m . ) Baseli ne: P: R: F1: b c P : R: F1: c t s P : R: F1: w l P : R: F1: P E T B O W B O W no m ar ki ng 50 .6 42.1 46.0 55 .1 37.3 44.5 49 .6 34.6 40.7 51 .2 40.6 45.3 57 .2 37.1 45.0 51 .5 34.7 41.4 51 .0 37.8 43.4 57 .5 31.8 41.0 54 .6 30.7 39.3 35 .4 32.8 34.0 41 .1 27.2 32.7 37 .6 25.7 30.6 P E T a d a p te d : I W 1 (u si n g P E T ) I W 2 (u si n g B O W ) P: R: F: 51 .4 44.1 47.4 51 .2 43.6 47.1 P: R: F: 49 .1 41.1 44.7 49 .1 41.3 44.9 P: R: F: 50 .8 37.5 43.1 51 .2 37.8 43.5 P: R: F: 35 .5 33.9 34.7 35 .6 33.8 34.7 W i t h S i m i l a r i t y : P W C B W C P L S A B L S A P: R: F1: 55 .4 44.6 49.4 47 .9 36.4 41.4 52 .3 44.1 47.9 53 .7 37.8 44.4 P: R: F1: 54 .3 41.4 47.0 49 .5 35.2 41.2 51 .4 41.7 46.0 55 .1 33.8 41.9 P: R: F1: 55 .9 37.1 44.6 53 .3 33.2 40.9 49 .7 36.5 42.1 54 .9 32.3 40.7 P: R: F1: 40 .0 32.7 36.0 31 .7 24.1 27.4 38 .1 36.5 37.3 39 .2 28.6 33.0 P+ P W C P+ P LS A 55 .0 46.5 50.4 52 .7 46.6 49.5 54 .4 43.4 48.3 53 .9 45.2 49.2 54 .1 38.1 44.7 49 .9 37.6 42.9 38 .4 34.5 36.3 37 .9 38.3 38.1 P+ P W C+ P LS A 55 .1 45.9 50.1 55 .3 43.1 48.5† 53 .1 37.0 43.6 39 .9 35.8 37.8† Table 5: In-domain (first column) and out-of-domain performance (columns two to four) on ACE 2005.</S>

			<S sid ="209" ssid = "52">This is also the case for LSA applied to the BOW kernel, which drops to 41.9.</S>
			<S sid ="210" ssid = "53">On the cts domain this is less pronounced.</S>
			<S sid ="211" ssid = "54">Only on the weblogs domain B LSA achieves a minor improvement (from 32.7 to 33.0).</S>
			<S sid ="212" ssid = "55">In general, dis- tributional semantics constrained by syntax (i.e. combined with PET) can be effectively exploited, while if applied ‘blindly’ – without the guide of syntax (i.e. BOW) – performance might drop, often considerably.</S>
			<S sid ="213" ssid = "56">We believe that the semantic information does not help the BOW kernel as there is no syntactic information that constrains the application of the noisy source, as opposed to the case with the PET kernel.</S>
			<S sid ="214" ssid = "57">As the two semantically enriched kernels, PET LSA and PET WC, seem to capture different information we use composite kernels (rows 10 11): the baseline kernel (PET) summed with the lexical semantic kernels.</S>
			<S sid ="215" ssid = "58">As we can see, results improve further: for instance on the bc test set, PET WC reaches an F1 of 47.0, while combined with PET (PET+PET WC) this improves to 48.3.</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "59">Adding also PET LSA results in the best performance and our final system (last row): the composite kernel (PET+PET WC+PET LSA) reaches an F1 of 48.5, 43.6 and 37.8 on the target domains, respectively, i.e. with an absolute improvement of: +3.2%, +0.2% and +3.8%, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="217" ssid = "60">Two out of three improvements are significant at p &lt; 0.05 (indicated by † in Table 5).</S>
			<S sid ="218" ssid = "61">Moreover, the system also improved in its own domain (first column), therefore having achieved robustness.</S>
			<S sid ="219" ssid = "62">By performing an error analysis we found that, for instance, the Brown clusters help to generalize locations and professions.</S>
			<S sid ="220" ssid = "63">For example, the baseline incorrectly considered ‘Dutch filmmaker’ in a PART-WHOLE relation, while our system correctly predicted GENAFF(filmmaker,Dutch).</S>
			<S sid ="221" ssid = "64">‘Filmmaker’ does not appear in the source, however ‘Dutch citizen’ does.</S>
			<S sid ="222" ssid = "65">Both ‘citizen’ and ‘filmmaker’ appear in the same cluster, thereby helping the system to recover the correct relation.</S>

			<S sid ="280" ssid = "6">We saw that adding cluster information blindly might actually hurt performance.</S>
			<S sid ="281" ssid = "7">In contrast, adding lexical information combined with syntax can help to improve performance: the syntactic structure enriched with lexical information provides a feature space where syntax constrains lexical similarity obtained from unlabeled data.</S>
