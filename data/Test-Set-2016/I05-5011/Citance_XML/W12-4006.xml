			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Entailment rules have been introduced to provide pieces of knowledge that may support entailment judgments (Dagan et al., 2009) with some degree of confidence.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">More specifically, an entailment rule is defined (Szpektor et al., 2007) as a directional relation between two sides of a pattern, corresponding to text fragments with variables (typically phrases or parse sub-trees).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">The left-hand side (LHS) of the pattern entails the right-hand side (RHS) of the same pattern under the same variable instantiation.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Given the Text-Hypothesis pair (T-H) in Example 1: Example 1.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">T: Dr. Thomas Bond established a hospital in Philadelphia for the reception and cure of poor sick persons.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">H: Dr. Bond created a medical institution for sick people.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">a (directional) lexical rule like: 1) LHS: hospital ⇒ RHS: medical institution probability: 0.8 brings to a TE system (aimed at recognizing that a particular target meaning can be inferred from different text variants in several NLP application, e.g. Question Answering or Information Extraction) the knowledge that the word hospital in Text can be aligned, or transformed, into the word medical institution in the Hypothesis, with a probability 0.8 that this operation preserves the entailment relation among T and H. Similar considerations apply for more complex rules involving verbs, as: 2) LHS: X establish Y ⇒ RHS: X create Y probability: 0.8 where the variables may be instantiated by any textual element with a specified syntactic relation with the verb.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Both kinds of rules are typically acquired either from structured sources (e.g. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)), or from unstructured sources according for instance to distributional properties (e.g. DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001)).</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Entailment rules should typically be applied only in specific contexts, defined in (Szpektor et al., 2007) as relevant contexts.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Some existing paraphrase and entailment acquisition algorithms add constraints to the learned rules (e.g.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">(Sekine, 2005), (CallisonBurch, 2008)), but most do not.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Because of a lack of an adequate representation of the linguistic context in which the 34 Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on the People’s Web Meets NLP, ACL 2012, pages 34–43, Jeju, Republic of Korea, 814 July 2012.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Qc 2012 Association for Computational Linguistics rules can be successfully applied, their concrete use reflects this limitation.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">For instance, rule 2 (extracted from DIRT) fails if applied to “The mathematician established the validity of the conjecture”, where the sense of establish is not a synonym of create (but of prove, demonstrate), decreasing system’s precision.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Moreover, these rules often suffer from lack of directionality, and from low accuracy (i.e. the strength of association of the two sides of the rule is often weak, and not well defined).</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Such observations are also in line with the discussion on ablation tests carried out at the last RTE evaluation campaigns (Bentivogli et al., 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Additional constraints specifying the variable types are therefore required to correctly instantiate them.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">In this work, we propose to take advantage of Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources (CSRs) (namely, Wikipedia) to mine information useful to context-rich entailment rule acquisition.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">More specifically, we take advantage of material obtained through Wikipedia revisions, which provides at the same time real textual variations from which we may extrapolate the relevant syntactic context, and several simplifications with respect to alternative resources.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">We consider T-H pairs where T is a revision of a Wikipedia sentence and H is the original sentence, as the revision is considered more informative then the revised sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for the acquisition of context-rich rules from Wikipedia revision pairs, focusing on two case studies, i.e. the acquisition of entailment rules for causality and for temporal expressions.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Both phenomena are highly frequent in TE pairs, and for both there are no available resources yet.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">The result of our experiments consists in a repository that can be used by TE systems, and that can be easily extended to entailment rules for other phenomena.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">The paper is organized as follows.</S>

			<S sid ="31" ssid = "1">The use of Wikipedia revision history in NLP tasks has been previously investigated by a few works.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "2">In (Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti, 2010), two versions of Wikipedia and semi-supervised machine learning methods are used to extract large TE data sets similar to the ones provided for the RTE challenges.</S>

			<S sid ="34" ssid = "4">Nelken and Yamangil (2008) compare different versions of the same document to collect users’ editorial choices, for automated text correction, sentence compression and text summarization systems.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "5">(Max and Wisniewski, 2010) use the revision history of French Wikipedia to create a corpus of natural rewritings, including spelling corrections, reformulations, and other local text transformations.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "6">In (Dutrey et al., 2011), a subpart of this corpus is analyzed to define a typology of local modifications.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "7">Because of its high coverage, Wikipedia is used by the TE community for lexical-semantic rules acquisition, named entity recognition, geographical in- formation1 (e.g.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "8">(Mehdad et al., 2009), (Mirkin et al., 2009), (Iftene and Moruz, 2010)), i.e. to provide TE systems with world and background knowledge.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "9">However, so far it has only been used as source of factual knowledge, while in our work the focus is on the acquisition of more complex rules, concerning for instance spatial or temporal expressions.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "10">The interest of the research community in producing specific methods to collect inference and paraphrase pairs is proven by a number of works in the field, which are relevant to the proposed approach.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "11">As for paraphrase, Sekine’s Paraphrase Database (Sekine, 2005) is collected using an unsupervised method, and focuses on phrases connecting two Named Entities.</S>

			<S sid ="59" ssid = "29">Our approach is different from theirs in many respects: their goal is paraphrase extraction, while we are extracting directional entailment rules; as textual resources for pattern extraction they use parallel corpora (using patterns in another language as pivots), while we rely on monolingual Wikipedia revisions (taking benefit from its increasing size); the paraphrases they extract are more similar to DIRT, while our approach allows to focus on the acquisition of rules for specific phenomena frequent in entailment pairs, and not covered by other resources.</S>

	<SECTION title="General methodology. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "1">The general approach we have implemented is based on the idea that, given a seed word, we extract all the entailment rules from Wikipedia revision pairs where the seed word appears as the head of the rule either in T or H. The head is the non-variable part of the rule on which the other parts depend (i.e. the word establish is the head of rule 2).</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "2">Entailment judgment.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "3">A Wikipedia revision may be consistent with the original sentence, bringing to an entailment relation, or it may introduce inconsistency, expressing a contradiction w.r.t. the original sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "4">We manually checked a sample of revision pairs (∼200), and we found out that in about 95% of the revisions entailment is preserved, in line with (Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti, 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "5">We assume this one as the default case in our experiments.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "6">Monothematic pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "7">The capability of automatic extraction of entailment rules is affected by the complexity of the pairs from which we extract the rules.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "8">In our experiments we take advantage of revision pairs with minimal difference between T and H, and we assume that for such pairs we have only one rule to extract.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "9">Under this perspective, T-H pairs derived from Wikipedia revisions have strong similarity with monothematic pairs (i.e. pairs where the entailment judgment is due to only one linguistic phenomenon, as suggested in (Bentivogli et al., 2010)).</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "10">Section 4.2 describes the algorithm for filtering out revision pairs with more than one phenomenon.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "11">Directionality.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "12">A Wikipedia revision, in principle, may be interpreted as either T entailing H, or as H entailing T. However, through a manual inspection of a revision sample (∼200 pairs), it came out thatin most of the cases the meaning of the revised sen tence (T) entails the meaning of the original one (H).</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "13">Given such observation, for our experiments (Sections 4 and 5) we assume that for all revision pairs, the revised sentence (T) entails the original one (H).</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "14">Context of a rule.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "15">We have defined the notion of context of a rule R as a set of morpho-syntactic constraints C over the application of R in a specific T-H pair.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "16">Ideally, the set of such constraints should be the minimal set of constraints over R such that the proportion of successful applications of R is maximized (e.g. the precision-recall mean is highest).</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "17">Intuitively, given an entailment rule, in absence of constraints we have the highest recall (the rule is always applied when the LHS is activated in T and the RHS is activated in H), although we may find cases of wrong application of the rule (i.e. low precision).</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "18">On the other side, as syntactic constraints are required (e.g. the subject of a verb has to be a noun) the number of successful applications increases, although we may find cases where the constraints prevent the correct application (e.g. low recall).</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "19">In the absence of a data set where we can empirically estimate precision and recall of rule application, we have approximated the ideal context on the basis of linguistic intuitions.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "20">More specifically, for different syntactic heads of the rules, we define the most appropriate syntactic constraints through a search algorithm over the syntactic tree produced on T and H (see Section 4.4 for a detailed explanation).</S>

			<S sid ="80" ssid = "1">In the next sections, the steps for the acquisition of rules from Wikipedia pairs are described in detail.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "2">4.1 Step 1: preprocessing Wikipedia dumps.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "3">We downloaded two dumps of the English Wikipedia (one dated 6.03.2009, Wiki 09, and one dated 12.03.2010, Wiki 10).4 We used the script WikiExtractor.py5 to extract plain text from Wikipedia pages, discarding any other information or annotation, but keeping the reference to the original document.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "4">For our goal, we consider only non- identical documents present in both Wiki 09 and Wiki 10 (i.e. 1,540,870 documents).</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "5">4.2 Step 2: extraction of entailment pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "6">For both Wiki 09 and Wiki 10 each document has been sentence-splitted, and the sentences of the two versions have been aligned to create pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "7">To measure the similarity between the sentences in each pair, we adopted the Position Independent Word Error Rate (PER) (Tillmann et al., 1997), a metric based on the calculation of the number of words which differ between a pair of sentences (diff function in (1)).</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "8">Such measure is based on Levenshtein distance, but works at word level, and allows for reordering of words and sequences of words between the two texts (e.g. a translated text s and a reference translation r).</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "9">It is expressed by the formula: P ER(s, r) = dif f (s,r)+dif f (r,s) l l 4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia: Database_download 5 http://medialab.di.unipi.it/wiki/ Wikipedia_Extractor Pairs are clustered according to different thresholds: • Pairs composed by identical sentences were discarded; if only one word was different in the two sentences, we checked if it was a typo correction using (Damerau, 1964) distance.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "10">If that was the case, we discarded such pairs as well.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "11">• Pairs in which one of the sentences contains the other one, meaning that the users added some information to the new version, without modifying the old one (set a: 1,547,415 pairs).</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "12">• Pairs composed by very similar sentences, where users carried out minor editing (PER &lt; 0.2) (set b: 1,053,114 pairs).</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "13">We filtered out pairs where differences were correction of misspelling and typos, and two-word sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "14">• Pairs composed by sentences where major editing was carried out (0.2 &lt; PER &lt; 0.6), but still describe the same event (set c: 2,566,364).</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "15">• Pairs in which the similarity between sentences is low (PER &gt; 0.6) were discarded.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "16">To extract entailment rules, we consider only the pairs contained in set b. For each pair, we intuitively set the sentence extracted from Wiki 10 as the Text, since we assume that it contains more (and more precise) information w.r.t. the sentence extracted from Wiki 09.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "17">We set the sentence extracted from Wiki 09 as the Hypothesis (see Examples 2 and 3).</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "18">Example 2.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "19">T: The Oxford Companion to Philosophy says ”there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold [...]” H: According to the Oxford Companion to Philosophy ”there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold [...]</S>

			<S sid ="102" ssid = "23">4.3 Step 3: extraction of entailment rules.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "24">Pairs in set b are collected in a data set, and processed with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003); chunks are extracted from each pair using the script chunklink.pl.6 The assumption underlying our approach is that the difference between T and H (i.e. the editing made by the user on a specific structure) can be extracted from such pairs and identified as an entailment rule.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "25">The rule extraction algorithm was implemented to this purpose.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "26">In details, for each sentence pair the algorithm iteratively compares the chunks of T and H to extract the ones that differ.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "27">It can be the case that several chunks of H are identical to a given chunk of T, as in: T:&lt;NP&gt;[The DT][Oxford NNP][Companion NNP] &lt;/NP&gt;&lt;PP&gt;[to TO]&lt;/PP&gt; &lt;NP&gt;[Philosophy NNP] &lt;/NP&gt;&lt;VP&gt;[says VBZ]&lt;/VP&gt;...</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "28">H:&lt;PP&gt;[According VBG]&lt;/PP&gt;&lt;PP&gt;[to TO]&lt;/PP&gt; &lt;NP&gt;[the DT][Oxford NNP][Companion NNP]&lt;/NP&gt; &lt;PP&gt;[to TO]&lt;/PP&gt;&lt;NP&gt;[Philosophy NNP]&lt;/NP&gt;...</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "29">Therefore, to decide for instance which chunk &lt;PP&gt;[to TO]&lt;/PP&gt; from H corresponds to the identical chunk in T, the algorithm checks if the previous chunks are equal as well.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "30">If this is the case, such chunks are matched.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "31">In the example above, the second chunk &lt;PP&gt;to&lt;/PP&gt; from H is considered as a good match because previous chunks in T and H are equal as well (&lt;NP&gt;the Oxford Companion&lt;/NP&gt;).</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "32">If the previous chunks in T and H are not equal, the algorithm keeps on searching.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "33">If such match is not found, the algorithm goes back to the first matching chunk and couples the chunk from T with it.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "34">Rules are created setting the unmatched chunks from T as the left-hand side of the rule, and the unmatched chunks from H as the right-hand side of the rule.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "35">Two consecutive chunks (different in T and H) are considered part of the same rule.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "36">For instance, from Examples 2 and 3: 2) &lt;LHS&gt; says &lt;/LHS&gt; &lt;RHS&gt; according to &lt;/RHS&gt; 3) &lt;LHS&gt; because of &lt;/LHS&gt; &lt;RHS&gt; due to &lt;/RHS&gt; On the contrary, two non consecutive chunks generate two different entailment rules.</S>

			<S sid ="118" ssid = "39">So far, rules extracted by the rule extraction algorithm (Section 4.3) are too general with respect to our goal.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "40">To add the minimum context to each rule (as discussed in Section 3), we implemented a rule expansion algorithm: both the file with the syntactic representation of the pairs (obtained with the Stanford parser), and the file with the rules extracted at Step 3 are provided as input.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "41">For every pair, and separately for T and H, the words isolated in the corresponding rule are matched in the syntactic tree of that sentence, and the common subsumer node is detected.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "42">Different strategies are applied to expand the rule, according to linguistic criteria.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "43">In details, if the common subsumer node is i) a Noun Phrase (NP) node, the rule is left as it is; ii) a Prepositional Phrase node (PP), all the terminal nodes of the subtree below PP are extracted; iii) a clause introduced by a subordinating conjunction (SBAR), all the terminal nodes of the subtree below SBAR are extracted; iv) an adjectival node (ADJP), all the terminal nodes of the tree below the ADJP node are extracted; v) a Verbal Phrase node (VP), the dependency tree under the VP node is extracted.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "44">For Example 3 (see Figure 1), the LHS of the rule because of is matched in the syntactic tree of T and the prepositional phrase (PP) is identified as common subsumer node.</S>

			<S sid ="127" ssid = "2">To show the applicability of the adopted methodology, we have performed two experiments focusing, respectively, on entail- ment rules for causality and temporal expressions.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "3">In particular, as case studies we chose two seeds: the conjunction because to derive rules for causality, and the preposition before for temporal expressions.</S>

			<S sid ="131" ssid = "6">Accordingly, we extracted from set b only the pairs containing one of these two seeds (either in T or &lt;/rule&gt; (NN 11 convenience)))) &lt;/RHS&gt; in H) and we built two separate data sets for our experiments.</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "7">We run the rule extraction algorithm, and then we filtered again the rules acquired, to collect only those containing one of the two seeds (either in the LHS or in the RHS).</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "8">This second filtering has been done because there could be pairs in which either because or before are present, but the differences in T and H do not concern those seeds.</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "9">The algorithm for rule expansion has then been applied to the selected rules to add the minimal context.</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "10">The resulting rule for Example 3 is: &lt;rule ruleid=&quot;23&quot; docid=&quot;844&quot; pairid=&quot;15&quot;&gt; &lt;LHS&gt; (PP (RB 8 because) (IN 9 of)(NP (PRP 10 their) (NN 11 convenience))) &lt;/LHS&gt; &lt;RHS&gt; (ADJP (JJ 8 due)(PP (TO 9 to) (NP (PRP 10 their) To create entailment rules balancing high- precision with their recall (Section 3), when the words of the context added to the rule in Step 4 are identical we substitute them with their PoS.</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "11">For Example 3, the rule is generalized as follows: &lt;rule ruleid=&quot;23&quot; docid=&quot;844&quot; pairid=&quot;15&quot;&gt; &lt;LHS&gt; (PP (RB because) (IN of)(NP (PRP) (NN))) &lt;/LHS&gt; &lt;RHS&gt; (ADJP (JJ due)(PP (TO to) (NP (PRP) (NN)))) &lt;/RHS&gt; &lt;/rule&gt; The intuition underlying the generalization phase is to allow a more frequent application of the rule, while keeping some constraints on the allowed context.</S>
			<S sid ="137" ssid = "12">The application of the rule from Example 3 is allowed if the subtrees below the seed words are the same (the rule can be applied in another T-H pair as, e.g. because of his status ⇒ due to his status).Contradictions (e.g. antonyms and semantic op positions) are generally very infrequent, but in certain cases they can have high impact (one of the most frequent rule collected for temporal expression is be fore S ⇒ after S).</S>
			<S sid ="138" ssid = "13">For this reason, we used WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to identify and filter antonyms out during the generalization phase.</S>
			<S sid ="139" ssid = "14">We also checked for awkward inconsistencies due to mistakes of the algorithm on noisy Wikipedia data (e.g. rules with the same seed word in both the LHS and the RHS), and we automatically filtered them out.</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "15">Table 1 reports a sample of rules extracted for each seed word.</S>
			<S sid ="141" ssid = "16">Statistics about the resulting data sets, i.e. the number of acquired rules both before and after the generalization phase are shown in Table 2.</S>
			<S sid ="142" ssid = "17">Identical rules are collapsed into a unique one, but the value of their frequency is kept in the header of that rule.</S>
			<S sid ="143" ssid = "18">Such index can then be used to estimate the correctness of the rule and, according to our intuition, the probability that the rule preserves the entailment relation.7 # rules before gen. causality 1671 temporal exp. 813 # rules after gen. 977 457 rules frequency ≥ 2 66 27 Table 2: Resulting sets of entailment rules 5.1 Evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "19">Due to the sparseness of the phenomena under consideration (i.e. causality and temporal expressions) in RTE data sets, evaluating the acquired rules on such data does not provide interesting results.</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "20">For this reason, (following (Zhao et al., 2009), (CallisonBurch, 2008), (Szpektor et al., 2004)), we opted for a manual analysis of a sample of 100 rules per set, including all the rules whose fre quency is ≥2 (Table 2), plus a random set of rules with frequency equal to 1.</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "21">Two annotators with skills in linguistics annotated such rules according 7 It is difficult to compare our results with related work, since such phenomena are not covered by other resources.</S>
			<S sid ="147" ssid = "22">The correct comparison would be with the subset of e.g. DIRT paraphrases dealing with causality and temporal relations, if any.</S>
			<S sid ="148" ssid = "23">to five possible values (rules have been presented with the sentence pairs from which they have been acquired): entailment=yes (YES), i.e. correctness of the rule; entailment=more-phenomena (+PHEN), i.e. the rule is correct, but more than one phenomenon is involved, see Section 5.2; entailment=unknown (UNK), i.e. there is no entailment between the LHS and the RHS of the rule, often because the editing changed the semantics of the proposition; entail- ment=unknown:reverse entailment (REV), wrong directionality, i.e. the RHS of the rule entails the LHS; entailment=error (ERR), i.e. the rule is wrong, either because the editing in Wiki10 was done to correct mistakes, or because the rule is not well-formed due to mistakes produced by our algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="149" ssid = "24">The inter-annotator agreement has been calculated, counting when judges agree on the assigned value.</S>
			<S sid ="150" ssid = "25">It amounts to 80% on the sample of rules for causality, and to 77% on the sample of rules for temporal expressions.</S>
			<S sid ="151" ssid = "26">The highest inter-annotator agreement is for correct entailment rules, whereas the lowest agreement rates are for unknown and error judgments.</S>
			<S sid ="152" ssid = "27">This is due to the fact that detecting correct rules is straightforward, while it is less clear whether to consider a wrong rule as well-formed but with an unknown judgment, or to consider it as not appropriate (i.e. error).</S>
			<S sid ="153" ssid = "28">Table 3 shows the outcomes of the analysis of the two sets of rules, as resulting after a reconciliation phase carried out by the an- notators.</S>
			<S sid ="154" ssid = "29">Such results, provided both for the whole samples8 and for the rules whose frequency is ≥2 only, are discussed in the next section.</S>

			<S sid ="158" ssid = "33">5.2 Discussion and error analysis.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "34">Due to the amount of noisy data present in Wikipedia, on average 19% of the collected rules 8 We are aware of the fact that including all the most frequent rules in the sample biases the results upwards, but our choice is motivated by the fact that we aim at verifying that with redundancy the accuracy is actually improved.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "35">include editing done by the users for spelling and typos corrections, or are just spam (Table 3).</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "36">To discard such cases, spell-checkers or dictionary-based filters should be used to improve our filtering techniques.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "37">Moreover, to select only reliable rules we consider making use of their frequency in the data to estimate the confidence that a certain rule maintains the entailment.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "38">The accuracy of the rules occurring more than once is indeed much higher than the accuracy estimated on the whole sample.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "39">Also the percentage of incorrect rules is strongly reduced when considering redundant rules.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "40">Our assumption about the directionality of entailment rules extracted from Wikipedia versions is also verified (less than 10% of the rules per set are tagged as reverse-entailment).</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "41">However, since the acquisition procedure privileges precision, only a few rules appear very frequently (Table 2), and this can be due to the constraints defined for the context extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "42">This fact motivates also the lower precision of the rules for temporal expressions, where 73% of the sample we analyzed involved rules with frequency equal to 1.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "43">Moreover, in most of the rules annotated as unknown, the editing of Wiki10 changed the semantics of the pair, e.g. before 1990 ⇒ 1893, or when x produced ⇒ because x produced.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "44">Further strategies to empirically estimate precision and recall of rule application should be experimented as future work.</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "45">Indeed, several rules appearing only once represent correct rules, and should not be discarded a priori.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "46">Finally, the idea of using only very similar pairs to extract entailment rules is based on the assumption that such rules should concern one phenomenon at a time (Bentivogli et al., 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "47">Despite the strategies adopted to avoid multiple phenomena per rule, in about 10% of the cases two phenomena (e.g lexical and syntactic) are collapsed on consecutive tokens, making it complex to separate them automatically: e.g. in because of his divorce settlement cost ⇒ due to the cost of his divorces settlement, the causative (because of x ⇒ due to x) and the argument realization (x cost ⇒ cost of x) rules should be separated.</S>

			<S sid ="173" ssid = "1">We have presented a methodology for the automatic acquisition of entailment rules from Wikipedia revision pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="174" ssid = "2">The main benefits are the follow ing: i) potential large-scale acquisition, given the increasing size of Wikipedia revisions; ii) new coverage, because Wikipedia revisions contain linguistic phenomena (e.g. causality, temporal expressions), which are not covered by existing resources: as a consequence, the coverage of current TE systems can be significantly extended; iii) quality: we introduce the notion of context of a rule as the minimal set of syntactic features maximizing its successful application, and we have implemented it as a search over the syntactic representation of revision pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="175" ssid = "3">Results obtained on two experimental acquisitions on causality and temporal expressions (seeds because and before) show both good quality and coverage of the extracted rules.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "4">The obtained resources9: i) cover entailment and paraphrasing aspects not represented in other similar sets of rules, ii) can be easily extended by applying the algorithms to automatically collect rules for other phenomena relevant to inference; and iii) are periodically updated, as Wikipedia revisions change continuously.</S>
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "5">We consider such aspects as part of our future work.</S>
			<S sid ="178" ssid = "6">These results encourage us to further improve the approach, considering a number of directions.</S>
			<S sid ="179" ssid = "7">First, we plan to improve our filtering techniques to exclude revision pairs containing more than one phenomenon considering the syntactic structure of the sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="180" ssid = "8">Moreover, we are planning to carry out more extended evaluations, according to two possible strategies: i) applying the instance-based approach (Szpektor et al., 2007) on the Penn Treebank data (i.e. for each PTB sentence that contains the LHS of an entailment rule from our set, a pair sentence will be generated by replacing the LHS of the rule with its RHS.</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "9">Human judges will then judge each pair); ii) integrating the extracted rules into existing TE systems.</S>
			<S sid ="182" ssid = "10">However, this evaluation has to be carefully designed, as the ablation tests carried on at the RTE challenges show.</S>
			<S sid ="183" ssid = "11">In particular, as RTE tasks are moving towards real applications (e.g. summarization) we think that knowledge reflecting real textual variations produced by humans (as opposed to knowledge derived from linguistic resources) may introduce interesting and novel hints.</S>

			<S sid ="185" ssid = "13">We encourage its integration into TE systems, to obtain feedback on its utility in TE tasks.</S>
