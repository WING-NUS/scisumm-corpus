Abstract
This paper presents the current status of de-
velopment of a finite state transducer gram-
mar for the verbal-chain transfer module in
Matxin, a Rule Based Machine Translation
system between Spanish and Basque. Due to
the distance between Spanish and Basque, the
verbal-chain transfer is a very complex mod-
ule in the overall system. The grammar is
compiled with foma, an open-source finite-
state toolkit, and yields a translation execution
time of 2000 verb chains/second.
1 Introduction
This paper presents the current status of develop-
ment of an FST (Finite State Transducer) grammar
we have developed for Matxin, a Machine Transla-
tion system between Spanish and Basque.
Basque is a minority language isolate, and it is
likely that an early form of this language was already
present in Western Europe before the arrival of the
Indo-European languages.
Basque is a highly inflected language with free
order of sentence constituents. It is an agglutinative
language, with a rich flexional morphology.
Basque is also a so-called ergative-absolutive lan-
guage where the subjects of intransitive verbs ap-
pear in the absolutive case (which is unmarked),
and where the same case is used for the direct ob-
ject of a transitive verb. The subject of the transi-
tive verb (that is, the agent) is marked differently,
with the ergative case (in Basque by the suffix -k).
The presence of this morpheme also triggers main
and auxiliary verbal agreement. Auxiliary verbs, or
?periphrastic? verbs, which accompany most main
verbs, agree not only with the subject, but also with
the direct object and the indirect object, if present.
Among European languages, this polypersonal sys-
tem (multiple verb agreement) is rare, and found
only in Basque, some Caucasian languages, and
Hungarian.
The fact that Basque is both a morphologically
rich and less-resourced language makes the use of
statistical approaches for Machine Translation dif-
ficult and raises the need to develop a rule-based
architecture which in the future could be combined
with statistical techniques.
The Matxin es-eu (Spanish-Basque) MT engine
is a classic transfer-based system comprising three
main modules: analysis of the Spanish text (based
on FreeLing, (Atserias et al, 2006)), transfer, and
generation of the Basque target text.
In the transfer process, lexical transfer is first
carried out using a bilingual dictionary coded in
the XML format of Apertium dictionary files (.dix)
(Forcada et al, 2009), and compiled, using the FST
library implemented in the Apertium project (the lt-
toolbox library), into a finite-state transducer that
can be processed very quickly.
Following this, structural transfer at the sentence
level is performed, and some information is trans-
ferred from some chunks1 to others while some
chunks may be deleted. Finally, the structural trans-
1A chunk is a non-recursive phrase (noun phrase, preposi-
tional phrase, verbal chain, etc.) which expresses a constituent
(Abney, 1991; Civit, 2003). In our system, chunks play a cru-
cial part in simplifying the translation process, due to the fact
that each module works only at a single level, either inside or
between chunks.
65
fer at the verb chunk level is carried out. The verbal
chunk transfer is a very complex module because of
the nature of Spanish and Basque auxiliary verb con-
structions, and is the main subject of this paper.
This verb chain transfer module is implemented
as a series of ordered replacement rules (Beesley and
Karttunen, 2003) using the foma finite-state toolkit
(Hulden, 2009). In total, the system consists of 166
separate replacement rules that together perform the
verb chunk translation. In practice, the input is given
to the first transducer, after which its output is passed
to the second, and so forth, in a cascade. Each rule in
the system is unambiguous in its output; that is, for
each input in a particular step along the verb chain
transfer, the transducers never produce multiple out-
puts (i.e. the transducers in question are functional).
Some of the rules are joined together with composi-
tion, yielding a total of 55 separate transducers. In
principle, all the rules could be composed together
into one monolithic transducer, but in practice the
size of the composed transducer is too large to be
feasible. The choice to combine some transduc-
ers while leaving others separate is largely a mem-
ory/translation speed tradeoff.
2 Spanish and Basque verb features and
their translation
In the following, we will illustrate some of the main
issues in translating Spanish verb chains to Basque.
Since both languages make frequent use of auxiliary
verb constructions, and since periphrastic verb con-
structions are frequent in Basque, transfer rules can
get quite complex in their design.
For example, in translating the phrase
(Yo) compro (una manzana)
(I) buy (an apple)
[PP1CSN00] [VMIP1S0] [DI0FS0] [NCFS000]
we can translate it using the imperfective partici-
ple form (erosten) of the verb erosi (to buy), and a
transitive auxiliary (dut) which itself contains both
subject agreement information (I: 1st sg.) and num-
ber agreement with the object (an apple: 3rd sg.):
(nik) (sagar bat) erosten dut. The participle carries
information concerning meaning, aspect and tense,
whereas the auxiliaries convey information about ar-
gument structure, tense and mood.
Table 1 illustrates the central idea of the verb
chunk transfer. In the first four examples the form of
the transitive auxiliary changes to express agreement
with different ergative arguments (the subject of the
clause), absolutive arguments (the direct object) and
dative arguments (the indirect object). In the fifth
example the future participle is used. The last ex-
ample shows the translation of a periphrastic con-
struction, in which the the Spanish and the Basque
word orders are completely different: this is re-
flected in the Spanish tengo que-construction (have
to) which appears before the main verb, whereas in
the Basque, the equivalent (behar) appears after the
main verb (erosi).
3 The FST grammar
We carry out the verbal chunk transfer using finite-
state transducers (Alegria et al, 2005). The gram-
mar rules take as input the Spanish verbal chunk,
perform a number of transformations on the input,
and then create and output the verbal chunk for
Basque.
To illustrate the functioning of the grammar, let us
consider the following example sentence in Spanish:
?Un tribunal ha negado los derechos constitu-
cionales a los presos polticos? (A court has denied
constitutional rights to political prisoners). The cor-
rect translation into Basque given by the system for
this example is as follows: Auzitegi batek eskubide
konstituzionalak ukatu dizkie preso politikoei. Fig-
ure 1 shows a detailed overview of how the whole
transfer of the verbal chunk is performed for this par-
ticular example.
First, the input to the grammar is assumed to be a
string containing (separated by the ?&? symbol) the
following information :
? the morphological information (using
EAGLES-style tags Leech and Wilson
(1996)) for all nodes (separated by ?+?
symbol) in the Spanish verbal chunk
(haber[VAIP3S0]+negar[VMP00SM]);
? the morphological information of the subject
([sub3s]), the direct object ([obj3p]) and the
indirect object ([iobj3p]);
? the translation of the main verb in Basque
(ukatu) and information about its transitivity

The grammatical rules are organized into three
groups according to the three main steps defined for
translating verbal chunks:
1. Identification of the Basque verbal chunk
schema corresponding to the source verbal
chunk.
There are twelve rules which perform this task,
each of which corresponds to one of the follow-
ing verbal chunks in Spanish: non-conjugated
verbs, simple non-periphrastic verbs as well
as four different groups reserved for the pe-
riphrastic verbs.
The verbal chunk of the example in figure 1 is
a simple non-periphrastic one, and the rule that
handles this particular case is as follows:
[simpleVerbEsType -> ...
simpleVerbEuSchema]
When this rule matches the input string
representing a simple non-periphrastic ver-
bal chunk (simpleVerbEsType) it adds the
corresponding Basque verbal chunk schema
(simpleVerbEuSchema) to the end of the input
string. simpleVerbEsType is a complex au-
tomaton that has the definition of the Spanish
simple verbs. simpleVerbEuSchema is the type
of the verbal chunk (SimpleVerb) and an au-
tomaton that contains as strings the pattern of
elements (separated by the ?/? symbol) that the
corresponding Basque verb chunk will need to
have (in this case, the main verb and the auxil-
iary verb):
SimpleVerb (main) AspectMain /
Aux TenseMood Abs Dat Erg
2. Resolution of the values for the attributes in the
Basque schema.
A total of 150 replacement rules of this type
have been written in the grammar. Here are
some rules that apply to the above example:
[AspectMain -> [perfPart] || ?* VAIP
?* SimpleVerb ?* ]
[Aux -> edun(aux) || ?* DIO ?* ]
[Abs -> [abs3p] || ?* [obj3p] ?*
edun(aux) ?* ]
3. Elimination of source-language information (4
rules in total).
The output of the grammar for the example is:
ukatu(main)[perfPart] /
edun(aux)[indPres][abs3p][dat3p][erg3s]
The first node has the main verb (ukatu) with
the perfective participle aspect, and the sec-
ond one contains the auxiliary verb (edun) with
all its morphological information: indicative
present and argument structure.
In the output string, each of the elements contains
the information needed by the subsequent syntactic
generation and morphological generation phases.
4 Implementation
When the verbal chunk transfer module was first de-
veloped, there did not exist any efficient open-source
tools for the construction of finite state transduc-
ers. At the time, the XFST-toolkit (Beesley and
Karttunen, 2003) was used to produce the earlier
versions of the module: this included 25 separate
transducers of moderate size, occupying 2,795 kB
in total. The execution speed was roughly 250 verb
chains per second. Since Matxin was designed to be
open source, we built a simple compiler that con-
verted the XFST rules into regular expressions that
could then be applied without FST technology, at the
cost of execution speed. This verbal chunk transfer
module read and applied these regular expressions
at a speed of 50 verbal chunks per second.
In the work presented here, we have reimple-
mented and expanded the original rules written for
XFST with the foma2 toolkit (Hulden, 2009). Af-
ter adapting the grammar and compiling it, the 55
separate transducers occupy 607 kB and operate at
roughly 2,000 complete verb chains per second.3
Passing the strings from one transducer to the next in
the chain of 55 transducers in accomplished by the
depth-first-search transducer chaining functionality
available in the foma API.
