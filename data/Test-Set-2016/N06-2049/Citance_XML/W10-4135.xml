			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Chinese word segmentation is deemed to be a prerequisite for Chinese language processing.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">The competition in the first CIPSSIGHAN joint conference put the task of Chinese word segmentation in a more challengeable setting, where training and test data are obtained from different domains.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">This setting is widely known as domain adaptation.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">For domain adaptation, either a large-scale unlabeled target domain data or a small size of labeled target domain data is required to adapt a system built on source domain data to the target domain.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">In this word segmentation competition, unfortunately, only a small size of unlabeled target domain data is available.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Thus we focus on handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">For this purpose, our system is based on a combination of subword-based tagging method (Zhang et al., 2006) and accessor variety-based new word recognition method (Feng et al., 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">In more detail, we adopted and extended subword-based method.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Subword list is augmented with new- word list recognized by accessor variety method.</S>

			<S sid ="15" ssid = "1">2.1 Subword-based Tagging with CRFs.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "2">The backbone of our system is a character-based segmenter with the application of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Zhao and Kit, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "3">In detail, we apply a six-tag tagging scheme, as in (Zhao et al., 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "4">That is , each Chinese character can be assigned to one of the tags in {B, B2 , B3, M , E, S }.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "5">Refer to (Zhao et al., 2006) for detailed meaning of the tags.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "6">Table 1 shows basic feature templates used in our system, where feature templates a, b, d, e are also used in (Zhu et al., 2006) for SVM-based word segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "7">In order to extend basic CRF-based segmenter, we first collect 2k most frequent words from training data.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "8">Hereafter, the list of such words is referred to as subword list.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "9">Moreover, single- character words 1, if they are not contained in the subword list, are also added.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "10">Such proce 1 By single-character word, we refer to words that consist solely of a Chinese character.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "11">Feature Template Description f) in(str, subword-list) is str in subword list g) in(str, confident-word-list) is str in confident-word list Table 2: Subword Features for CRF-based Segmenter dure for constructing a subword list is similar to the one used in (Zhang et al., 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "12">To enhance the effect of subwords, we go one step further to build a list, named confident-word list here and below, which contains words that are not a portion of other words and are never segmented in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "13">In the competition, 400 most frequent words in the confident-word list are used.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "14">With subword list and confident-word list, both training and test data are segmented with forward maximum match method by using the union of subword list and confident-word list.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "15">Each segmentation unit (single-character or multi- character unit) in the segmentation results are regarded as “pseudo character” and thus can be represented with the basic features in Table 1 and two additional features as shown in Table 2.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "16">See the details of subword-based Chinese word segmentation in (Zhang et al., 2006) 2.2 OOV Recognition with Accessor Variety.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "17">Accessor variety (AV) (Feng et al., 2004) is a simple and effective unsupervised method for extraction of new Chinese words.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "18">Given a unsegmented text, each substring (candidate word) in the text can be assigned a value according to the following equation: AV (s) = min{Lav (s), Rav (s)} (1) where the left and right AV values, Lav (s) and Rav (s) are defined to be the number of distinct character types appearing on the left and right, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "19">Candidate words are sorted in the descending order of AV values and most highly ranked ones can be chosen as new words.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "20">In practical applications, heuristic filtering rules are generally needed (Feng et al., 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "21">We re- implemented the AV method and filtering rules, as in (Feng et al., 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "22">Moreover, we filter out candidate words that have AV values less than 3.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "23">Unfortunately, candidate word list generated this way still contains many noisy words (substrings that are not words).</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "24">One possible reason is that unlabeled data (test data) used in the competition is extremely small in size.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "25">In order to refine the results derived from the AV method, we make use of the training data to filter the results from two different perspectives.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "26">• Segment test data with the CRF-based segmenter described above.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "27">Then we collect (candidate) words that are in the CRF-based segmentation results, but not appear in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "28">Such words are called CRFOOV words hereafter.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "29">We retain the intersection of CRFOOV words and AV-based results as the set of candidate words to be processed by the following step.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "30">• Any candidate word in the intersection of CRF-based and AV-based results will be filtered out if they satisfy one of the following conditions: 1) the candidate word is a part of some word in the training data; 2) the candidate word is formed by connection of consecutive words in the training data; 3) the candidate word contains position words, such as 上 (up), 下 (down), 左 (left), 右 (right), etc. Moreover, we take all English words in test data as OOV words.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "31">A simple heuristic rule is defined for the purpose of English word recognition: an English word is a consecutive sequence of English characters and punctuations between two English characters (including these two characters).</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "32">We finally add all the OOV words into subword list and confident-word list.</S>
	</SECTION>
	<SECTION title="Post-Processing Rules. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "1">In the results of subword-based word segmentation with CRFs, we found some errors could be corrected with heuristic rules.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "2">For this purpose, we propose following post-processing rules, for handling OOV and in-vocabulary (IV) words, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "3">3.1 OOV Rules.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "4">3.1.1 Annotation-Standard Independent Rules We assume the phenomena discussed in the following are general across all kinds of annotation standards.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "5">Thus corresponding rules can be applied without considering annotation standards of training data.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "6">• A punctuation tends to be a single-character word.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "7">If a punctation’s previous character and next character are both Chinese characters, i.e. not punctuation, digit, or English character, we always regard the punctuation as a word.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "8">• Consecutive and identical punctuations tend to be joined together as a word.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "9">For example, “—” represents a Chinese hyphen which consists of three “-”, and “!!!” is used to show emphasizing.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "10">Inspired by this observations, we would like to unite consecutive and identical punctuations as a single word.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "11">• When the character “·” appears in the training data, it is generally used as a connections symbol in a foreign person name, suchas “圣·约翰 (Saint John)”.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "12">Taking this ob servation into consideration, we always unite the character “·” and its previous and next segment units into a single word.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "13">A similar rule is designed to unite consecutive digits on the sides of the symbol “.”, ex.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "14">“1.11”.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "15">• We notice that four consecutive characters which are in the pattern of AABB generally form a single word in Chinese, for example ”平平淡淡 (dull)”.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "16">Taking this observation into account, we always unite consecutive characters in the AABB into a single word.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "17">3.1.2 Templates with Generalized Digits Words containing digits generally belong to a open class, for example, the word “2012年 (AD2012）” means a date.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "18">Thus CRF-based seg menter has difficulties in recognizing such words since they are frequently OOV words.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "19">To attack this challenge, we first generalize digits in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "20">In detail, we replaced consecutive digits with ”*”.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "21">For example, the word “2012年”will be transformed into “*年”.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "22">Second, we col lect word templates which consist of three consecutive words on condition that at least one of the words in a template contains the character “*” and that the template appears in the training data more than 4 times.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "23">For example, we can get a template like “*月(month) *日(day) 电(publish)”.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "24">With such templates, we are able to correct errors, say “10月 17日电” into “10月 17日 电”.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "25">3.2 IV Rules.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "26">We notice that long words have less ambiguity than short words in the sense of being words.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "27">For example, characters in “人 才 济 济 （full of talents)” always form a word in the training data, whereas “人 才” have two plausible splitting forms, as “人才 (talent)” or “人 (people) 才 (only)”.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "28">In our system, we collect words that have at least four characters and filter out words which belong to one of following cases: 1) the word is a part of other words; 2) the word consists solely of punctation and/or digit.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "29">For example, “唯 物 主 义 (materialism)” and “一 百 二 十 (120)” are discarded, since the former is a substring of the word “唯物主义者 (materialist)” and the latter is a word of digits.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "30">Finally we get a list containing about 6k words.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "31">If a character sequence in the test data is a member in the list, it is retained as a word in the final segmentation results.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "32">Another group of IV rules concern character sequences that have unique splitting in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "33">For example, “女人们 (women)” is al ways split as “女人 (woman) 们 (s)”.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "34">Hereafter, we refer to such character sequences as unique- split-sequence (USS).</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "35">In our system, we are concerned with UUSs which are composed of less than 5 words.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "36">In order to apply UUSs for post- processing, we first collect word sequence of variable length (word number) from training data.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "37">In detail, we collect word sequences of two words, three words, and four words.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "38">Second, word sequences that have more than one splitting cases in the training data are filtered out.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "39">Third, spaces between words are removed to form USSs.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "40">For example, the words “女人 (woman) 们 (s)” will form the USS “女人们 ”.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "41">Finally, we search the test data for each USS.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "42">If the searching succeeds, the USS will be replaced with the corresponding word sequence.</S>
