			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Many approaches have been proposed in Chinese word segmentation in the past decades.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Segmentation performance has been improved significantly, from the earliest maximal match (dictionary-based) approaches to HMM-based (Zhang et al., 2003) approaches and recent state-of-the-art machine learning approaches such as maximum entropy (MaxEnt) (Xue and Shen, 2003), support vector machine ∗ Now the second author is affiliated with NTT.</S>

			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">By analyzing the top results in the first and second Bakeoffs, (Sproat and Emerson, 2003) and (Emerson, 2005), we found the top results were produced by direct or indirect use of so-called “IOB” tagging, which converts the problem of word segmentation into one of character tagging so that part-of-speech tagging approaches can be used for word segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">This approach was also called “LMR” (Xue and Shen, 2003) or “BIES” (Asahara et al., 2005) tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as ”B” if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or ”I” otherwise, and ”O” if the character functioned as an independent word.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">For example, “全(whole) 北京市(Beijing city)” is labeled as “全/O 北/B 京/I 市/I”.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Thus, the training data in word sequences are turned into IOB-labeled data in character sequences, which are then used as the training data for tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">For new test data, word boundaries are determined based on the results of tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">While the IOB tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation, we found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">If only Chinese characters are used, the subword-based IOB tagging is downgraded to a character-based one.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Taking thesame example mentioned above, “全北京市” is la 961 Proceedings of the COLING/ACL 2006 Main Conference Poster Sessions, pages 961–968, Sydney, July 2006.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Qc 2006 Association for Computational Linguistics beled as “全/O 北京/B 市/I” in the subword-based tagging, where “北京/B” is labeled as one unit.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">We will give a detailed description of this approach in Section 2.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">There exists a clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach: It yields a very low in-vocabulary rate (R-iv) in return for a higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate (R-oov).</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using CRFs for the IOB tagging, yielded a very high R-oov in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">In this work we propose a confidence measure approach to lessen this weakness.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">By this approach we can change the R-oov and R-iv and find an optimal tradeoff.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">This approach will be described in Section 2.3.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">In addition, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is described by the MaxEnt method.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">Section 3 presents our experimental results.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">The effects using the MaxEnts and CRFs are shown in this section.</S>

			<S sid ="53" ssid = "12">cN , the problem of word segmentation can be formalized as finding a word sequence, We applied Bayes’ law in the above derivation.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "13">Because the word sequence must keep consistent with the character sequence, P(C|W ) is expanded to be a multiplication of a Kronecker delta function series, δ(u, v), equal to 1 if both arguments are the same and 0 otherwise.</S>

			<S sid ="58" ssid = "17">We looked up the lexicon to find all the IVs, and evaluated the word sequences by the LMs.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "18">We used a beam search (Jelinek, 1998) instead of a viterbi search to decode the best word sequence because we found that a beam search can speed up the decoding.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "19">N-gram LMs were used to score all the hypotheses, of which the one with the highest LM scores is the final output.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "20">The experimental results are presented in Section 3.1, where we show the comparative results as we changed the order of LMs.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "21">2.2 Subword-based IOB tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "22">There are several steps to train a subword-based IOB tagger.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "23">First, we extracted a word list from the training data sorted in decreasing order by their counts in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "24">We chose all the single characters and the top multi-character words as a lexicon subset for the IOB tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "25">If the subset consists of Chinese characters only, it is a character-based IOB tagger.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "26">We regard the words in the subset as the sub- words for the IOB tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "27">Second, we re-segmented the words in the training data into subwords of the subset, and assigned IOB tags to them.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "28">For the character- based IOB tagger, there is only one possibility for re-segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "29">However, there are multi ple choices for the subword-based IOB　tagger.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "30">For example, “北 京 市(Beijing-city)” can be segmented as “北 京 市(Beijing-city)/O,” or “北 京(Beijing)/B 市(city)/I,” or ”北(north)/B京(capital)/I 市(city)/I.” In this work we used for ward maximal match (FMM) for disambiguation.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "31">Because we carried out FMMs on each words in the manually segmented training data, the accuracy of FMM was much higher than applying it on whole sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "32">Of course, backward maximal match (BMM) or other approaches are also applicable.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "33">We did not conduct comparative experiments due to trivial differences in the results of these approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "34">In the third step, we used the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach (the results of CRF are given in Section 3.4) to train the IOB tagger (Xue and Shen, 2003).</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "35">The mathematical expression for the MaxEnt model is word and tag sequences; fi, a binary feature equal to 1 if the i-th defined feature is activated and 0 otherwise; Z, a normalization coefficient; and λi, the weight of the i-th feature.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "36">Many kinds of features can be defined for improving the tagging accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "37">However, to conform to the constraints of closed test in Bakeoff 2005, some features, such as syntactic information and character encodings for numbers and alphabetical characters, are not allowed.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "38">Therefore, we used the features available only from the provided training corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "39">• Contextual information: w0, t−1, w0t−1, w0t−1w1, t−1w1, t−1t−2, w0t−1t−2, w0w1, w0w1w2, w−1, w0w−1, w0w−1w1, w−1w1, w−1w−2, w0w−1w−2, w1, w1w2 where w stands for word and t, for IOB tag.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "40">The subscripts are position indicators, where 0 means the current word/tag; −1, −2, the first or second word/tag to the left; 1, 2, the first or second word/tag to the right.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "41">• Prefixes and suffixes.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "42">These are very useful features.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "43">Using the same approach as in (Tseng et al., 2005), we extracted the most frequent words tagged with “B”, indicating a prefix, and the last words tagged with “I”, denoting a suffix.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "44">Features containing prefixes and suffixes were used in the following combinations with other features, where p stands for prefix; s, suffix; p0 means the current word is a prefix and s1 denotes that the right first word is a suffix, and so on.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "45">p0, w0 p−1, w0 p1, s0, w0 s−1, w0 s1, p0w−1, p0w1, s0w−1, s0w−2 • Word length.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "46">This is defined as the number of characters in a word.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "47">The length of a Chinese word has discriminative roles for word composition.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "48">For example, single-character words are more apt to form new words than are multiple-character words.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "49">Features using word length are listed below, where l0 means   the word length of the current word.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "50">Others can P(t|h) = exp  λi fi(h, t) /Z, Z = P(t|h) (2) be inferred similarly.</S>

			<S sid ="93" ssid = "52">We used IIS to train the maximum entropy model.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "53">For details, refer to (Lafferty et al., 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "54">The tagging algorithm is based on the beam- search method (Jelinek, 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "55">After the IOB tagging, each word is tagged with a B/I/O tag.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "56">The word segmentation is obtained immediately.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "57">The experimental effect of the word-based tagger and its comparison with the character-based tagger are made in section 3.2.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "58">2.3 Confidence-dependent word segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "59">In the last two steps we produced two segmentation results: the one by the dictionary-based approach and the one by the IOB tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "60">However, neither was perfect.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "61">The dictionary-based segmentation produced a result with a higher R-iv but lower R-oov while the IOB tagging yielded the contrary results.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "62">In this section we introduce a confidence measure approach to combine the two results.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "63">We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob|w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary- based segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "64">The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary-based word segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "65">Its calculation is defined as: C M(tiob|w) = αC Miob(tiob|w) + (1 − α)δ(tw, tiob)ng (3) where tiob is the word w’s IOB tag assigned by the IOB tagging; tw, a prior IOB tag determined by the results of the dictionary-based segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "66">After the dictionary-based word segmentation, the words are re-segmented into subwords by FMM before being fed to IOB tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "67">Each subword is given a prior IOB tag, tw.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "68">C Miob(t|w), a confidence probability derived in the process of IOB tagging, which is defined as C M (t w) = hi P(t|w, hi) t hi P(t|w, hi) where hi is a hypothesis in the beam search.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "69">δ(tw, tiob)ng denotes the contribution of the dictionary-based segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "70">δ(tw, tiob)ng is a Kronecker delta function defined as δ(t , t ) = 1 if tw = tiob 0 otherwise In Eq. 3, α is a weighting between the IOB tagging and the dictionary-based word segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "71">We found an empirical value 0.8 for α.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "72">By Eq. 3 the results of IOB tagging were reevaluated.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "73">A confidence measure threshold, t, was defined for making a decision based on the value.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "74">If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "75">A new OOV was thus created.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "76">For the two extreme cases, t = 0 is the case of the IOB tagging while t = 1 is that of the dictionary-based approach.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "77">In Section 3.3 we will present the experimental segmentation results of the confidence measure approach.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "78">In a real application, we can actually change the confidence threshold to obtain a satisfactory balance between R-iv and R-oov.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "79">An example is shown in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "80">In the stage of IOB tagging, a confidence is attached to each word.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "81">In the stage of confidence-based, a new confidence was made after merging with dictionary-based results where all single-character words are labeled as “O” by default except “Beijing-city” labeled as “Beijing/B” and “city/I”.</S>

			<S sid ="198" ssid = "1">The IOB tagging approach adopted in this work is not a new idea.</S>
			<S sid ="199" ssid = "2">It was first implemented in Chinese word segmentation by (Xue and Shen, 2003) using the maximum entropy methods.</S>
			<S sid ="200" ssid = "3">Later, (Peng and McCallum, 2004) implemented the idea using the CRF-based approach, which yielded better results than the maximum entropy approach because it could solve the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="201" ssid = "4">However, as we mentioned before, this approach does not take advantage of the prior knowledge of in-vocabulary words; It produced a higher R-oov but a lower R-iv.</S>
			<S sid ="202" ssid = "5">This problem has been observed by some participants in the Bakeoff 2005 (Asahara et al., 2005), where they applied the IOB tagging to recognize OOVs, and added the OOVs to the lexicon used in the HMM- based or CRF-based approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="203" ssid = "6">(Nakagawa, 2004) used hybrid HMM models to integrate word level and character level information seamlessly.</S>
			<S sid ="204" ssid = "7">We used confidence measure to determine a better balance between R-oov and R-iv.</S>
			<S sid ="205" ssid = "8">The idea of using the confidence measure has appeared in (Peng and McCallum, 2004), where it was used to recognize the OOVs.</S>
			<S sid ="206" ssid = "9">In this work we used it more than that.</S>
			<S sid ="207" ssid = "10">By way of the confidence measure we combined results from the dictionary-based and the IOB- tagging-based and as a result, we could achieve the optimal performance.</S>
			<S sid ="208" ssid = "11">Our main contribution is to extend the IOB tagging approach from being a character-based to a subword-based one.</S>
			<S sid ="209" ssid = "12">We proved that the new approach enhanced the word segmentation signifi cantly in all the experiments, MaxEnts, CRFs and using confidence measure.</S>
			<S sid ="210" ssid = "13">We tested our approach using the standard Sighan Bakeoff 2005 data set in the closed test.</S>
			<S sid ="211" ssid = "14">In Table 7 we align our results with some top runners’ in the Bakeoff 2005.</S>
			<S sid ="212" ssid = "15">Our results were compared with the best performers’ results in the Bakeoff 2005.</S>
			<S sid ="213" ssid = "16">Two participants’ results were chosen as bases: No.15-b, ranked the first in the AS corpus, and No.14, the best performer in CITYU, MSR and PKU.</S>
			<S sid ="214" ssid = "17">The No.14 used CRF-modeled IOB tagging while No.15-b used MaxEnt-modeled IOB tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="215" ssid = "18">Our results produced by the MaxEnt are denoted as “ours(ME)” while “ours(CRF)” for the CRF approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "19">We achieved the highest F-scores in three corpora except the AS corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="217" ssid = "20">We think the proposed subword- based approach played the important role for the achieved good results.</S>
			<S sid ="218" ssid = "21">A second advantage of the subword-based IOB tagging over the character-based is its speed.</S>
			<S sid ="219" ssid = "22">The subword-based approach is faster because fewer words than characters needed to be labeled.</S>
			<S sid ="220" ssid = "23">We observed a speed increase in both training and testing.</S>
			<S sid ="221" ssid = "24">In the training stage, the subword approach was almost two times faster than the character-based.</S>
