This paper describes an algorithm which automatically discovers word senses from free text and maps them to the appropriate entries of existing dictionary or, taxonomies. It is based on a graph model representing words and relationships between them. A word sense algorithm is outlined which bypasses the problem of parameter turning. The authors describe the experiment that examines the performance of their algorithm on a set of words with varying degree of ambiguity. They also present a sample of the results. The algorithm recognises and resolves ambiguity. It gives rise to an automatic, unsupervised word sense disambiguation algorithm.
