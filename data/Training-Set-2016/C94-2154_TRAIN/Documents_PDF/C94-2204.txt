ABSTRACT 
A description is an entity that can be inter- preted as true or false of an object, and us-ing feature structures as descriptions accrues several computational benefits. In this paper, 1 create an explicit interpretation of a typed feature structure used as a description, define the notion of a satisfiable fe.ature structure, and create a simple and effective algorithm to decide if a fe.ature structure is satisfiable. 


1. INTRODUCTION 
Describing objects is one of several purposes for which linguists use fe.at, ul:e structures. A description is an er, tity that can be interpreted as true or false of an object. For example, the conventional interpretation of the description 'it is black' is true of a soot particle, but false of ~ snowtlake, q'herefore, any use of a feature structure to describe an object delnands that the feature structure can be interpreted as true or false of the object. In this paper, I tailor the semantics of [K~NG 1 989] to suit the typed feature structures of [CAII.I'F, NTFA{ 1 992], and so create an explicit interpretation of a typed feature structure used as a descript, ion. I then use this interpretation to define the notion of a satisfiable feature structure. 
Though no featm'e structure algebra provides descriptions as expressive as those provided by a feature logic, using feature structures to describe objects profits from a large stock of available computational techniques to repre-sent, test and process feature structures. In this paper, I demonstrate the computational benefits of marrying a tractable syntax and an explicit semantics by creating a simple and effective algorithm to decide the satisfiability

of a feature structure. Gerdemann and Ggtz's 'Doll type resolution system implements both the sen,antics and an efficient refinement of the satisfiability algorithm I present here (see [C,5TZ 1993], [GEItDF, MANN AND I(ING 1994] and [G~m)EMA~N (VC)]). 


2. A FEATURE STRUCTURE 
SEMANTICS 
A signatm.e provides the symbols from which to construc.t typed feature structures, and an interpretation gives those symbols meaning. Definition 1. E is a siguature iff 
E is a sextuple (~, %, ~, G, ffl, ~), 
is a set, 
(%,-<} is a partial order, 
{ foreachrE72, } 
= crC72. |fair thcna=r ' 

~2t is a so/,, 
is a partial tbnction from the Cartesian product of 72 and ~2[ to %, and for each r C 37, each r' C % and each o" C ~, 
if~(r, or) is defined aml r ~ r' 
then ~(r', ct) is defined, and 

a(~, ~) _-< a(<, .). ]Ienceforth, I tacitly work with a signature {Q, 72, ~, O, ~(, ~}. 1 call members of Q states, members of 37 types, ~ subsumption, members of ~ species, members of 9.1 attributes, and ~: appropriateness. Do.fil).itlon 2. 1 is an interpretation iff 
l is a triple (U, S, A), 

U is a set, 
S is a total time|ion from U to 
A is a total function from ~{ to the set of 
partial functions from U to U, 
tbr each (t C ~[ and each u C U, 

if a((:~)(~,) is deC, ned 
then ~(S(u), a) is defined, and 
;~(s'(~,), ,,) ~ ,V(A(~)(*O), and 
for each cY G ~( and each u E U, 
if~(X(u), a) is d(,Jined 

Suppose that 1 is an interpretation (U, £', A). I call each member of U an object in I. 

"1250

The denotations of the species partition U, and S assigns et*ch object iu 1 the ul|ique species whose denottttion contains the object.: ol)jcct u is in the denotation of species cr it[' cr = ,~'(u). Subsumption <m<:odes t~ rel~tionship bcl;wccn the denotations of species and I,ypcs: object ,t is in the denotation of I;ype r if[ r ~ 5;(u). So, if r~ _-j r2 then the denol:~ttiou o[" type rt contMns the denotation of l;ylw, 7"2. 
Each at|;rilmte del~otes a. partial ft,nction 
from l;hc objects iu 1 to tim ob.icct.s iu i, aim A assigns e~clt artl;ribute the l>m:t;ia[ funcl.iol~ il, denol;es. Appropriateness encodes ~t rcbttion- ship between l;he dcnotaLions of species and atl:ributes: ifa(cr, ,v) is deliued then the den()- tt~tion of a.ttributc (v acts upoi~ each ol~jecl, il, the, denota.l;ion of species cr to yield at, olLiect in the dcnol, ation of type ~(o-, ,v), but ifa((r, ,,,) is undefined then the denotati(m of al.l.ribul.e ~v ~tc/.s upon no object in the deuotalion of species or. So, if~(r,{v) is defined then the. (h> uota.tion of a ll, ribute rt a.cl.s Ul~(m each objccl, in the denotation of tyl)c v 1;o yichl an object in the del|otal;iol~ of type a(r, ,').

F is true of a under 1 
iff 1;' approximates the abstraction of u 

under I. 

Theorem 18. For each feature structure I,', l i' is satisfiable iff 1,' approximates some morph. 
Proof. From prol>ositions 15 and 17. B 
4. RESOLVED FEATURE STRUCTURES 
Though theorem 18 gives an interpretation free eharacterisation of a satisfiable feature structure, the characterisation still seems to admit of no effective algorithm to decide if a feature structure is satisfiable, tlowever, I use theorem 18 and resolve.d feature structures to yield a less general interpretation free charac- terisation of a satisfiable feature structure that admits of such an algorithm. Definition 19. R is a resolved feature struc- ture itr 
R is a feature structure (Q, q, a, p}, 
p is a total function from Q to 6, and 
for each ~ E 91 and each q' G Q, 

if ~(q I, ct) is defined 
then ~(p(q'), ~r) is defined, and 


(~(p(q'), oz) ~_ p(a(q', c~)). Bach resolved feature structure is a well-typed (see [CARI'ENTF, R 1992]) feature structure with output alphabet (%. Definition 20. I¢. is a resolvant off iff 
R is a resolved lbature structure (Q, q, 6, p), F is a feature structure (Q,q,~,O), and rot each q' e Q, o(q') ~_ p(q'). 

Proposition 21. ~br each interpretation I, each object u in I an(/ each feature structure I a , 
1;' is true of u under 1 
ill"some resolwmt of J;' is true of u under I. 


Definition 22. (~, %, -<, 0,~2[, ~) is rational 
iff for each er G 0 and each (v G ~2[, ira(o-, ~) is defined then ~r some a' ~ O, ~(cr, a') :<_ or'. 
Proposition 23. 1[" (~, %, ~, O, ~21, ~) is ra- tional then for each resolved tbature structure R, R is satisfiabh'.. Proof. Suppose that N. = (Q, q, 6, p) mid fl is a bijection from ordinal ( to G. Let

5. A SATISFIABILITY ALGORITHM

for each r G • and each c~ G 92, if ~(r, cY) is defined then APP(T,¢v) --=- ~(r,~v) otherwise APP(r, (v) ='undefined', 

Proposition 26. lf(~,%, ~, 0,~1,~) is con> puta.lde then for some effective fimction RES, [br each feature structure I a, RES(]") --a list of the resolvants o1' [". 
Proof. Since (k~, '12, y, '0, ~, ~) is computabh'. for some elfeetiw; function GEN,

Theorem 27. /f (k~,~, ~, ~,~,~) is rational and computable then for some eflbctive func-tion SAT, 
for each feature structure F, 
if F is satisfiable 
then SAT(F) = 'true 
otherwise SAT(F) = 'false'. 


Proof, From theorem 24 and proposition 26. 
Gerdemann and G6tz's Troll system (see [G6Tz 1993], [GFRDEIVIANN AND KING 1994] and [GERDEMANN (FC)]) employs an efficient refinement of RES to test the satisfiability of feature structures. In fact, Troll represents each feature structure as a disjunction of the resolvants of the feature structure. Loosely speaking, the resolvants of a feature structure have the same underlying finite state automa- ton as the feature structure, and differ only in their output fllnction. Troll exploits this property to represent each feature structure as a finite state automaton and a set of output flmctions. The '1¥oll unifier is closed on these representations. Thus, though RES is compu- tationally expensive, Troll uses RES only dur- ing compilation, never during run time.
