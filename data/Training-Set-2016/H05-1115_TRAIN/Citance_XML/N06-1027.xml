			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Threaded discussion is popular in virtual cyber communities and has applications in areas such as customer support, community development, interactive reporting (blogging) and education.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Discussion threads can be considered a special case of human conversation, and since we have huge repositories of such discussion, automatic and/or semiautomatic analysis would greatly improve the navigation and processing of the information.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">A discussion thread consists of a set of messages arranged in chronological order.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">One of the main challenges in the Question Answering domain is how to extract the most informative or important message in the sequence for the purpose of answering the initial question, which we refer to as the conversation focus in this paper.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">For example, people may repeatedly discuss similar questions in a discussion forum and so it is highly desirable to detect previous conversation focuses in order to automatically answer queries (Feng et al., 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Human conversation focus is a hard NLP (Natural Language Processing) problem in general because people may frequently switch topics in a real conversation.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">The threaded discussions make the problem manageable because people typically focus on a limited set of issues within a thread of a discussion.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Current IR (Information Retrieval) techniques are based on keyword similarity measures and do not consider some features that are important for analyzing threaded discussions.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">As a result, a typical IR system may return a ranked list of messages based on keyword queries even if, within the context of a discussion, this may not be useful or correct.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Threaded discussion is a special case of human conversation, where people may express their ideas, elaborate arguments, and answer others’ questions; many of these aspects are unexplored by traditional IR techniques.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">First, messages in threaded discussions are not a flat document set, which is a common assumption for most IR systems.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Due to the flexibility and special characteristics involved in human conversations, messages within a thread are not necessarily of equal importance.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">The real relationships may differ from the analysis based on keyword similarity measures, e.g., if a 2nd message “corrects” a 1st one, the 2nd message is probably more important than the 1st.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">IR systems may give different results.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Second, messages posted by different users may have different degrees of correctness and trustworthiness, which we refer to as poster trustworthiness in this paper.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">For instance, a domain expert is likely to be more reliable than a layman on the domain topic.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">208 In this paper we present a novel feature-enriched approach that learns to detect conversation focus of threaded discussions by combining NLP analysis and IR techniques.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">Using the graph-based algorithm HITS (Hyperlink Induced Topic Search, Kleinberg, 1999), we conduct discussion analysis taking into account different features, such as lexical similarity, poster trustworthiness, and speech act relations in human conversations.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">We generate a weighted threaded discussion graph by applying feature-oriented link generation functions.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">All the features are quantified and integrated as part of the weight of graph edges.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">In this way, both quantitative features and qualitative features are combined to analyze human conversations, specifically in the format of online discussions.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">To date, it is the first quantitative study to analyze human conversation that focuses on threaded discussions by taking into account heterogeneous evidence from different sources.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">The study described here addresses the problem of conversation focus, especially for extracting the best answer to a particular question, in the context of an online discussion board used by students in an undergraduate computer science course.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">Different features are studied and compared when applying our approach to discussion analysis.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Experimental results show that performance improvements are significant compared with the baseline system.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: We discuss related work in Section 2.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">Section 3 presents thread representation and the weighted HITS algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">Section 4 details feature-oriented link generation functions.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Comparative experimental results and analysis are given in Section 5.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">We discuss future work in Section 6.</S>

	<SECTION title="Related Work. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "1">Human conversation refers to situations where two or more participants freely alternate in speaking (Levinson, 1983).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "2">What makes threaded discussions unique is that users participate asynchronously and in writing.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "3">We model human conversation as a set of messages in a threaded discussion using a graph-based algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "4">Graph-based algorithms are widely applied in link analysis and for web searching in the IR community.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "5">Two of the most prominent algorithms are Page-Rank (Brin and Page, 1998) and the HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "6">Although they were initially proposed for analyzing web pages, they proved useful for investigating and ranking structured objects.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "7">Inspired by the idea of graph based algorithms to collectively rank and select the best candidate, research efforts in the natural language community have applied graph-based approaches on keyword selection (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), text summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mi-halcea, 2004), word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea et al., 2004; Mihalcea, 2005), sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004), and sentence retrieval for question answering (Otterbacher et al., 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "8">However, until now there has not been any published work on its application to human conversation analysis specifically in the format of threaded discussions.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "9">In this paper, we focus on using HITS to detect conversation focus of threaded discussions.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "10">Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thomson, 1988) based discourse processing has attracted much attention with successful applications in sentence compression and summarization.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "11">Most of the current work on discourse processing focuses on sentence-level text organization (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) or the intermediate step (Sporleder and Lapata, 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "12">Analyzing and utilizing discourse information at a higher level, e.g., at the paragraph level, still remains a challenge to the natural language community.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "13">In our work, we utilize the discourse information at a message level.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "14">Zhou and Hovy (2005) proposed summarizing threaded discussions in a similar fashion to multi-document summarization; but then their work does not take into account the relative importance of different messages in a thread.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "15">Marom and Zuker-man (2005) generated help-desk responses using clustering techniques, but their corpus is composed of only two-party, two-turn, conversation pairs, which precludes the need to determine relative importance as in a multiply conversation.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "16">In our previous work (Feng et al., 2006), we implemented a discussion-bot to automatically answer student queries in a threaded discussion but extract potential answers (the most informative message) using a rule-based traverse algorithm that is not optimal for selecting a best answer; thus, the result may contain redundant or incorrect information.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "17">We argue that pragmatic knowledge like speech acts is important in conversation focus analysis.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "18">However, estimated speech act labeling between messages is not sufficient for detecting 209 human conversation focus without considering other features like author information.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "19">Carvalho and Cohen (2005) describe a dependency-network based collective classification method to classify email speech acts.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "20">Our work on conversation focus detection can be viewed as an immediate step following automatic speech act labeling on discussion threads using similar collective classification approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "21">We next discuss our approach to detect conversation focus using the graph-based algorithm HITS by taking into account heterogeneous features.</S>

	<SECTION title="Conversation Focus Detection. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "1">In threaded discussions, people participate in a conversation by posting messages.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "2">Our goal is to be able to detect which message in a thread contains the most important information, i.e., the focus of the conversation.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "3">Unlike traditional IR systems, which return a ranked list of messages from a flat document set, our task must take into account characteristics of threaded discussions.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "4">First, messages play certain roles and are related to each other by a conversation context.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "5">Second, messages written by different authors may vary in value.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "6">Finally, since postings occur in parallel, by various people, message threads are not necessarily coherent so the lexical similarity among the messages should be analyzed.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "7">To detect the focus of conversation, we integrate a pragmatics study of conversational speech acts, an analysis of message values based on poster trustworthiness and an analysis of lexical similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "8">The subsystems that determine these three sources of evidence comprise the features of our feature-based system.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "9">Because each discussion thread is naturally represented by a directed graph, where each message is represented by a node in the graph, we can apply a graph-based algorithm to integrate these sources and detect the focus of conversation.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "10">3.1 Thread Representation.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "11">A discussion thread consists of a set of messages posted in chronological order.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "12">Suppose that each message is represented by mi, i =1,2,…, n. Then the entire thread is a directed graph that can be represented by G= (V, E), where V is the set of nodes (messages), V= {mi,i=1,...,n}, and E is the set of directed edges.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "13">In our approach, the set V is automatically constructed as each message joins in the discussion.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "14">E is a subset of VxV.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "15">We will discuss the feature-oriented link generation functions that construct the set E in Section 4.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "16">We make use of speech act relations in generating the links.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "17">Once a speech act relation is identified between two messages, links will be generated using generation functions described in next section.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "18">When mi is a message node in the thread graph, VmF i ?)( represents the set of nodes that node mi points to (i.e., children of mi), and VmB i ?)( represents the set of nodes that point to mi (i.e., parents of mi).</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "19">3.2 Graph-Based Ranking Algorithm: HITS.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "20">Graph-based algorithms can rank a set of objects in a collective way and the affect between each pair can be propagated into the whole graph iteratively.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "21">Here, we use a weighted HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) algorithm to conduct message ranking.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "22">Kleinberg (1999) initially proposed the graph-based algorithm HITS for ranking a set of web pages.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "23">Here, we adjust the algorithm for the task of ranking a set of messages in a threaded discussion.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "24">In this algorithm, each message in the graph can be represented by two identity scores, hub score and authority score.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "25">The hub score represents the quality of the message as a pointer to valuable or useful messages (or resources, in general).</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "26">The authority score measures the quality of the message as a resource itself.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "27">The weighted iterative updating computations are shown in Equations 1 and 2.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "28">? ?+ = )( 1 )(*)(ij mFm jr ijir mauthoritywmhub (1) ??</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "29">+ =)( 1 )(*)(ij mBm jr jiir mhubwmauthority (2) where r and r+1 are the numbers of iterations.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "30">The number of iterations required for HITS to converge depends on the initialization value for each message node and the complexity of the graph.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "31">Graph links can be induced with extra knowledge (e.g. Kurland and Lee, 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "32">To help integrate our heterogeneous sources of evidence with our graph-based HITS algorithm, we introduce link generation functions for each of the three features, (gi, i=1, 2, 3), to add links between messages.</S>

			<S sid ="88" ssid = "1">210 Conversation structures have received a lot of attention in the linguistic research community (Levinson, 1983).</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "2">In order to integrate conversational features into our computational model, we must convert a qualitative analysis into quantitative scores.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "3">For conversation analysis, we adopted the theory of Speech Acts proposed by (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969) and defined a set of speech acts (SAs) that relate every pair of messages in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "4">Though a pair of messages may only be labeled with one speech act, a message can have multiple SAs with other messages.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "5">We group speech acts by function into three categories, as shown in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "6">Messages may involve a request (REQ), provide information (INF), or fall into the category of interpersonal (INTP) relationship.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "7">Categories can be further divided into several single speech acts.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "8">Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "9">Categories of Message Speech Act.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "10">The SA set for our corpus is given in Table 1.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "11">A speech act may a represent a positive, negative or neutral response to a previous message depending on its attitude and recommendation.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "12">We classify each speech act as a direction as POSITIVE (+), NEGATIVE (-) or NEUTRAL, referred to as SA Direction, as shown in the right column of Table 1.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "13">The features we wish to include in our approach are lexical similarity between messages, poster trustworthiness, and speech act labels between message pairs in our discussion corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "14">The feature-oriented link generation is conducted in two steps.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "15">First, our approach examines in turn all the speech act relations in each thread and generates two types of links based on lexical similarity and SA strength scores.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "16">Second, the sys tem iterates over all the message nodes and assigns each node a self-pointing link associated with its poster trustworthiness score.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "17">The three features are integrated into the thread graph accordingly by the feature-oriented link generation functions.</S>

			<S sid ="110" ssid = "23">Discussions are constructed as people express ideas, opinions, and thoughts, so that the text itself contains information about what is being discussed.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "24">Lexical similarity is an important measure for distinguishing relationships between message pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "25">In our approach, we do not compute the lexical similarity of any arbitrary pair of messages, instead, we consider only message pairs that are present in the speech act set.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "26">The cosine similarity between each message pair is computed using the TF*IDF technique (Salton, 1989).</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "27">Messages with similar words are more likely to be semantically-related.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "28">This information is represented by term frequency (TF).</S>

			<S sid ="122" ssid = "35">To determine the trustworthiness of a person, we studied the responses to their messages throughout the entire corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "36">We used the percentage of POSITIVE responses to a person’s messages to measure that person’s trustworthiness.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "37">In our case, POSITIVE responses, which are defined above, included SUP, COMP, and ACK.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "38">In addition, if a person’s message closed a discussion, we rated it POSITIVE.</S>
