This is quite similar to the bagged decision trees of bigrams (B) presented here, except that the earlier work learns a single decision tree where training examples are represented by the top 100 ranked bigrams, according to the loglikelihood ratio. This earlier approach was evaluated on the SENSEVAL -1 data and achieved an overall accuracy of 64% | Reference Offset:  ['14284-14410', '16126-16283', '21439-21468', '23780-23860', '29656-29848', '30758-30925'] | Reference Text:  Our empirical study utilizes the training and test data from the 1998 SENSEVAL evaluation of word sense disambiguation systems ... Two feature sets are selected from the training data based on the top 100 ranked bigrams according to the power divergence statistic and the Dice Coefficient ...

While the accuracy of this approach was as good as any previously published results, the learned models were complex and difficult to interpret, in effect acting as very accurate black boxes ... Most important, their structure is easy to interpret and may provide insights into the relationships that exist among features and more general rules of disambiguation | Discourse Facet:  Method_Facet | Annotator:  Muthu Kumar Chandrasekaran, NUS |

The context in which an ambiguous word occurs is represented by some number of binary features that indicate whether or not a particular bigram has occurred within approximately 50 words to the left or right of the word being disambiguated. ...
