Initial work was done on spoken interactions (see for example (Stolcke et al.,2000)) | Reference Offset:  ['21','22','23','24','26','27'] | Reference Text:  The ability to model and automatically detect discourse structure is an important step toward understanding spontaneous dialogue. While there is hardly consensus on exactly how discourse structure should be described, some agreement exists that a useful first level of analysis involves the identification of dialogue acts (DAs). A DA represents the meaning of an utterance at the level of illocutionary force (Austin 1962). Thus, a DA is approximately the equivalent of the speech act of Searle (1969), the conversational game move of Power (1979), or the adjacency pair part of Schegloff (1968) and Saks, Schegloff, and Jefferson (1974) ... Each utterance is assigned a unique DA label (shown in column 2), drawn from a well-defined set (shown in Table 2). Thus, DAs can be thought of as a tag set that classifies utterances according to a combination of pragmatic, semantic, and syntactic criteria. | Discourse Facet:  Method_Facet | Annotator:  Muthu Kumar Chandrasekaran, NUS |

Interactional dominance (Linell 1990) might be measured more accurately using DA distributions than with simpler techniques, and could serve as an indicator of the type or genre of discourse at hand.
