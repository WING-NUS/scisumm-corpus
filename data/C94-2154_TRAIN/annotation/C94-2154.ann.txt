In fact, Troll represents each feature structure as a disjunction of the resolvants of the feature structure. Loosely speaking, the resolvants of a feature structure have the same underlying finite state automaton as the feature structure, and differ only in their output function. Troll exploits this property to represent each feature structure as a finite state automaton and a set of output functions. The Troll unifier is closed on these representations. Thus, though RES is computationally expensive, Troll uses RES only during compilation, never during run time | Reference Offset:  ['8715-9837', '11331-11988'] | Reference Text:  By contrast, the Troll system described in this paper has an effective algorithm for deciding well-formedness, which is based on the idea of efficiently representing disjunctive possibilities within the feature structure, Call a well-typed feature structure in which all nodes are labelled with species a resolved feature structure and call a set of resolved feature structures that have the same underlying graph (that is,they differ only in their node labellings) a disjunctive resolved feature structure. We write FS, RFS and DRFS for the collections of feature structures, resolved feature structures and disjunctive resolved feature structures respectively. Say that F' E RFS is a resolvant of F E FS iff F and F' have the same underlying graph and F subsumes F'. Let type resolution be the total function R:FS -> DRFS such that R(F) is the set of all resolvants of F. Guided by the partition and all-or-nothing conditions, King [13] has formulated a semantics of feature structures and developed a notion of a satisfiable feature structure such that F E FS is satisfiable iff R(F) 0. ... A very important property of the class of DRFS is that they are closed under unification, i.e., if F and F' E DRFS then F U F' E DRFS. Given this property, it would in principle be possible to use the disjunctive resolved feature structures in an implementation without any additional type inferencing procedure to maintain satisfiability. It would, of course, not be very efficient to work with such large disjunctions of feature structures. These disjunctions of feature structures, however, have a singular property: all of the disjuncts have the same shape. The disjuncts differ only in the types labeling the nodes. | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  Muthu Kumar Chandrasekaran, NUS |

Their approach produces a set of feature structures from a satisfiability algorithm such that all of the feature structures have the same shape but the nodes may be labeled by different types. They then collapse this set down to a single feature structure where nodes are labeled with dependent disjunctions of types | Reference Offset:  ['8715-9227', '9618-10050'] | Reference Text:  By contrast, the Troll system described in this paper has an effective algorithm for deciding well-formedness, which is based on the idea of efficiently representing disjunctive possibilities within the feature structure, Call a well-typed feature structure in which all nodes are labelled with species a resolved feature structure and call a set of resolved feature structures that have the same underlying graph (that is, they differ only in their node labellings) a disjunctive resolved feature structure ...
