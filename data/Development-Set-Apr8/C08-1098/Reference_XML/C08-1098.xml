			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">A Hidden-Markov-Model part-of-speech tagger (Brants, 2000, e.g.) computes the most probable POS tag sequence tˆN = tˆ1, ..., tˆN for a given word sequence wN . POS taggers are usually trained on corpora with between 50 and 150 different POS tags.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Tagsets of this size contain little or no information about number, gender, case and similar morphosyntac- tic features.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">For languages with a rich morphology such as German or Czech, more fine-grained tagsets are often considered more appropriate.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">The additional information may also help to disambiguate the (base) part of speech.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Without gender information, for instance, it is difficult for a tagger to correctly disambiguate the German sentence Ist das Realita¨ t?</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">(Is that reality?).</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">The word das is ambiguous between an article and a demonstrative.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Because of the lack of gender agreement between das (neuter) and the noun Realita¨ t (feminine), the article reading must be wrong.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">The German Tiger treebank (Brants et al., 2002) is an example of a corpus with a more fine-grained tagset (over 700 tags overall).</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Large tagsets aggravate sparse data problems.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">As an example, take the German sentence Das zu versteuernde Einkommen sinkt (“The to be taxed income decreases”; The tˆN N N 1 = arg max p(t1 , w1 ) 1 The joint probability of the two sequences is defined as the product of context probabilities and lexical probabilities over all POS tags: N taxable income decreases).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">This sentence should be tagged as shown in table 1.</S>

			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">Unfortunately, the POS trigram consisting of the tags of the first three words does not occur in the Tiger corpus.</S>

			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">If the probability is smoothed with the backoff distribution p(•|P ART .Z u), the most probable tag is ADJA.Pos.Acc.Sg.Fem rather than ADJA.Pos.Nom.Sg.Neut.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">Thus, the agreement between the article and the adjective is not checked anymore.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">A closer inspection of the Tiger corpus reveals that it actually contains all the information needed to completely disambiguate each component of the POS tag ADJA.Pos.Nom.Sg.Neut: • All words appearing after an article (ART) and the infinitive particle zu (PART.zu) are attributive adjectives (ADJA) (10 of 10 cases).</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">• All adjectives appearing after an article and a particle (PART) have the degree positive (Pos) (39 of 39 cases).</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">• All adjectives appearing after a nominative article and a particle have nominative case (11 of 11 cases).</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">• All adjectives appearing after a singular article and a particle are singular (32 of 32 cases).</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">• All adjectives appearing after a neuter article and a particle are neuter (4 of 4 cases).</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">By (1) decomposing the context probability of ADJA.Pos.Nom.Sg.Neut into a product of attribute probabilities p(ADJA | 2:ART, 2:ART.Def, 2:ART.Nom, 2:ART.Sg, 2:ART.Neut, 1:PART, 1:PART.Zu) ∗ p(Pos| 2:ART, 2:ART.Def, 2:ART.Nom, 2:ART.Sg, 2:ART.Neut, 1:PART, 1:PART.Zu, 0:ADJA) ∗ p(Nom | 2:ART, 2:ART.Def, 2:ART.Nom, 2:ART.Sg, 2:ART.Neut, 1:PART, 1:PART.Zu, 0:ADJA, 0:ADJA.Pos) ∗ p(Sg | 2:ART, 2:ART.Def, 2:ART.Nom, 2:ART.Sg, 2:ART.Neut, 1:PART, 1:PART.Zu, 0:ADJA, 0:ADJA.Pos, 0:ADJA.Nom) ∗ p(Neut | 2:ART, 2:ART.Def, 2:ART.Nom, 2:ART.Sg, 2:ART.Neut, 1:PART, 1:PART.Zu, 0:ADJA, 0:ADJA.Pos, 0:ADJA.Nom, 0:ADJA.Sg) and (2) selecting the relevant context attributes for the prediction of each attribute, we obtain the ∗ p(Sg | 2:ART.Sg, 1:PART.Zu, 0:ADJA) ∗ p(Neut | 2:ART.Neut, 1:PART.Zu, 0:ADJA) The conditional probability of each attribute is 1.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">Hence the context probability of the whole tag is. also 1.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">Without having observed the given context, it is possible to deduce that the observed POS tag is the only possible tag in this context.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">These considerations motivate an HMM tagging approach which decomposes the POS tags into a set of simple attributes, and uses decision trees to estimate the probability of each attribute.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">Decision trees are ideal for this task because the identification of relevant attribute combinations is at the heart of this method.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">The backoff smoothing methods of traditional n-gram POS taggers require an ordering of the reduced contexts which is not available, here.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">Discriminatively trained taggers, on the other hand, have difficulties to handle the huge number of features which are active at the same time if any possible combination of context attributes defines a separate feature.</S>

			<S sid ="40" ssid = "1">Decision trees (Breiman et al., 1984; Quinlan, 1993) are normally used as classifiers, i.e. they assign classes to objects which are represented as attribute vectors.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "2">The non-terminal nodes are labeled with attribute tests, the edges with the possible outcomes of a test, and the terminal nodes are labeled with classes.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "3">An object is classified by evaluating the test of the top node on the object, following the respective edge to a daughter node, evaluating the test of the daughter node, and so on until a terminal node is reached whose class is assigned to the object.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "4">Decision Trees are turned into probability estimation trees by storing a probability for each possible class at the terminal nodes instead of a single result class.</S>

			<S sid ="50" ssid = "11">It is the difference between the entropy of the empirical distribution of the class variable in the training set and the weighted average entropy yes 0:N.Name yes no 1:ART.Nom no 1:ADJA.Nom yes no which returns a probability of 0.3.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "12">The third tree for neuter has one non terminal and two terminal nodes returning a probability of 0.3 and 0.5, respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "13">The sum of probabilities is therefore either 0.9 or 1.1, but never exactly 1.</S>

			<S sid ="57" ssid = "18">The tree is recursively expanded by selecting the best test for each subset and so on, until all objects of the current subset belong to the same class.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "19">In a second step, the decision tree may be pruned in order to avoid overfit- ting to the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "20">Our tagger generates a predictor for each feature (such as base POS, number, gender etc.) Instead of using a single tree for the prediction of all possible values of a feature (such as noun, article, etc. for base POS), the tagger builds a separate decision tree for each value.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "21">The motivation was that a tree which predicts a single value (say verb) does not fragment the data with tests which are only relevant for the distinction of two other values (e.g. article and possessive pronoun).2 Furthermore, we observed that such two-class decision trees require no optimization of the pruning threshold (see also section 2.2.) The tree induction algorithm only considers binary tests, which check whether some particular attribute is present or not.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "22">The best test for each node is selected with the standard information gain criterion.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "23">The recursive tree building process terminates if the information gain is 0.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "24">The decision tree is pruned with the pruning criterion described below.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "25">Since the tagger creates a separate tree for each attribute, the probabilities of a set of competing attributes such as masculine, feminine, and neuter will not exactly sum up to 1.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "26">To understand why, assume that there are three trees for the gender attributes.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "27">Two of them (say the trees for masculine and feminine) consist of a single terminal node base POS) in order to make sure that the probability of an attribute is 0 if it never appeared with the respective base POS.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "28">All context attributes other than the base POS are always used in combination with the base POS.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "29">A typical context attribute is “1:ART.Nom” which states that the preceding tag is an article with the attribute “Nom”.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "30">“1:ART” is also a valid attribute specification, but “1:Nom” is not.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "31">The tagger further restricts the set of possible test attributes by requiring that some attribute of the POS tag at position i-k (i=position of the predicted POS tag, k ≥ 1) must have been used be fore an attribute of the POS tag at position i-(k+1) may be examined.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "32">This restriction improved the tagging accuracy for large contexts.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "33">2.2 Pruning Criterion.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "34">The tagger applies3 the critical-value pruning strategy proposed by (Mingers, 1989).</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "35">A node is pruned if the information gain of the best test multiplied by the size of the data subsample is below a given threshold.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "36">To illustrate the pruning, assume that D is the data of the current node with 50 positive and 25 negative elements, and that D1 (with 20 positive and 20 negative elements) and D2 (with 30 positive and 5 negative elements) are the two subsets induced by the best test.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "37">The entropy of D is −2/3 log22/3 − 1/3 log21/3 = 0.92, the entropy of D1 is −1/2 log21/2−1/2 log21/2 = 1, and the entropy of D2 is −6/7 log26/7 − 1/7 log21/7 = 0.59.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "38">The information gain is therefore 0.92 − (8/15 ∗ 1 − 7/15 ∗ 0.59) = 0.11.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "39">The resulting score is 75 ∗ 0.11 = 8.25.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "40">Given a threshold of 6, the node is therefore not pruned.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "41">We experimented with pre-pruning (where a node is always pruned if the gain is below the in the two subsets.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "42">The weight of each subset is proportional to its size.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "43">2 We did not directly compare the two alternatives (two- valued vs. multi-valued tests), because the implementational effort required would have been too large.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "44">3 We also experimented with a pruning criterion based on binomial tests, which returned smaller trees with a slightly lower accuracy, although the difference in accuracy was never larger than 0.1% for any context size.</S>

			<S sid ="86" ssid = "47">The performance of pre-pruning was slightly better and it was less dependent on the choice of the pruning threshold.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "48">A threshold of 6 consistently produced optimal or near optimal results for pre-pruning.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "49">Thus, pre-pruning with a threshold of 6 was used in the experiments.</S>

			<S sid ="99" ssid = "5">4.1 Supplementary Lexicon.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "6">The tagger may use an external lexicon which supplies entries for additional words which are not found in the training corpus, and additional tags for words which did occur in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "7">If an external lexicon is provided, the lexical probabilities are smoothed as follows: The tagger computes the average tag probabilities of all words with the same set of possible POS tags.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "8">The Witten-Bell method is then applied to smooth the lexical probabilities with the average probabilities.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "9">If the word w was observed with N different tags, and f (w, t) is the joint frequency of w and POS tag t, and p(t|[w]) is the average probability of t among words with the same set of possible tags as w, then the smoothed probability of t given w is defined as follows: f (w, t) + N p(t|[w]) the preceding attributes of the predicted POS tag is estimated with a decision tree as described be p(t|w) = f (w) + N fore.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "10">The probabilities at the terminal nodes of the decision trees are smoothed with the parent node probabilities (which themselves were smoothed in the same way).</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "11">The smoothing is implemented by adding the weighted class probabilities pp(c) of the parent node to the frequencies f (c) before normalizing them to probabilities: p(c) = f (c) + αpp(c) α + �c f (c) The weight α was fixed to 1 after a few experiments on development data.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "12">This smoothing strategy is closely related to Witten-Bell smoothing.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "13">The probabilities are normalized by dividing them by the total probability of all attribute values of the respective feature (see section 2.1).</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "14">The best tag sequence is computed with the Viterbi algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "15">The main differences of our tag- ger to a standard trigram tagger are that the order of the Markov model (the k in equation 1) is not fixed 4 This is the reason why the attribute tests in figure 1 used complex attributes such as ART.Nom rather than Nom.The smoothed estimates of p(tag|word) are di vided by the prior probability p(tag) of the tag and used instead of p(word|tag).5 4.2 Unknown Words.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "16">The lexical probabilities of unknown words are obtained as follows: The unknown words are divided into four disjoint classes6 with numeric expressions, words starting with an uppercase letter, words starting with a lowercase letter, and a fourth class for the other words.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "17">The tagger builds a suffix trie for each class of unknown words using the known word types from that class.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "18">The maximal length of the suffixes is 7.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "19">The suffix tries are pruned until (i) all suffixes have a frequency of at least 5 and (ii) the information gain multiplied by the suffix frequency and di 5 p(word|tag) is equal to p(tag|word)p(word)/p(tag) and p(word) is a constant if the tokenization is unambiguous.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "20">Therefore dropping the factor p(word) has no influence on the ranking of the different tag sequences.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "21">6 In earlier experiments, we had used a much larger number of word classes.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "22">Decreasing their number to 4 turned out to be better.</S>
