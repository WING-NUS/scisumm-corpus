			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Morphologically complex languages often lead to data sparsity problems in statistical machine translation.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">For translation pairs with morphologically rich source languages and English as target language, we focus on simplifying the input language in order to reduce the complexity of the translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">The pre-processing of the source-language is language-specific, requiring morphological analysis (FR, RU) as well as sentence reordering (DE) and dealing with compounds (DE).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Due to time constraints we did not deal with inflection for DEEN and ENDE.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">The morphological simplification process consists in lemmatizing inflected word forms and dealing with word formation (splitting portmanteau prepositions or compounds).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">This needs to take into account translation-relevant features (e.g. number) which vary across the different language pairs: while French only has the features number and gender, a wider array of features needs to be considered when modelling Russian (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">table 6).</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">In addition to morphological reduction, we also apply transliteration models learned from automatically 1 The language pairs DEEN and RUEN were developed in collaboration with the Qatar Computing Research Institute and the University of Szeged.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">mined transliterations to handle out-of-vocabulary words (OOVs) when translating from Russian.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Replacing inflected word forms with simpler variants (lemmas or the components of split compounds) aims not only at reducing the general complexity of the translation model, but also at decreasing the amount of out-of-vocabulary words in the input data.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">This is particularly the case with German compounds, which are very productive and thus often lack coverage in the parallel training data, whereas the individual components can be translated.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Similarly, inflected word forms (e.g. adjectives) benefit from the reduction to lemmas if the full inflection paradigm does not occur in the parallel training data.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">For ENFR, a translation pair with a morpho- logically complex target language, we describe a two-step translation system built on non-inflected word stems with a post-processing component for predicting morphological features and the generation of inflected forms.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">In addition to the advantage of a more general translation model, this method also allows the generation of inflected word forms which do not occur in the training data.</S>

			<S sid ="30" ssid = "1">French has a much richer morphology than English; for example, adjectives in French are inflected with respect to gender and number whereas adjectives in English are not inflected at all.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "2">This causes data sparsity in coverage of French inflected forms.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "3">We try to overcome this problem by simplifying French inflected forms in a pre-processing step in order to adapt the French input better to the English output.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "4">Processing of the training and test data The pre-processing of the French input consists of two steps: (1) normalizing not well-formed data (cf.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "5">table 1) and (2) morphological simplification.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "6">In the second step, the normalized training data is annotated with Part-of-Speech tags (PoS-tags) and word lemmas using RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008) which was trained on the French tree- bank (Abeille´ et al., 2003).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "7">French forms are then simplified according to the rules given in table 2.</S>

			<S sid ="40" ssid = "11">Due to tractability problems with word alignment, the 109 French-English corpus and the UN corpus were filtered to a more manageable size.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "12">The filtering criteria are sentence length (between 15 and 25 words), as well as strings indicating that a sentence is neither French nor English, or otherwise not well-formed, aiming to obtain a subset of good-quality sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "13">In total, we use 9M parallel sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "14">For the English language model we use large training data with 287.3M true-cased sentences (including the LDC Giga-word data).</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "15">We compare two systems: a baseline with regular French text, and a system with the described morphological simplifications.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "16">Results for the WMT2012 test set are shown in table 3.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "17">Even though the baseline is better than the simplified system in terms of BLEU, we assume that the translation model of the simplified system benefits from the overall generalization – thus, human annotators might prefer the output of the simplified system.</S>

	<SECTION title="English to French. " number = "4">
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "1">Translating into a morphologically rich language faces two problems: that of asymmetry of morphological information contained in the source and target language and that of data sparsity.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "2">In this section we describe a two-step system designed to overcome these types of problems: first, the French data is reduced to non-inflected forms (stems) with translation-relevant morphological features, which is used to built the translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "3">The second step consists of predicting all necessary morphological features for the translation output, which are then used to generate fully inflected forms.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "4">This two-step setup decreases the complexity of the translation task by removing language- specific features from the translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "5">Furthermore, generating inflected forms based on word stems and morphological features allows to gener ate forms which do not occur in the parallel training data – this is not possible in a standard SMT setup.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "6">The idea of separating the translation into two steps to deal with complex morphology was introduced by Toutanova et al.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "7">(2008).</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "8">Fraser et al.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "9">(2012) applied this method to the language pair EnglishGerman with an additional special focus on word formation issues such as the splitting and merging of portmanteau prepositions and compounds.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "10">The presented inflection prediction systems focuses on nominal inflection; verbal inflection is not addressed.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "11">Morphological analysis and resources The morphological analysis of the French training data is obtained using RFTagger, which is designed for annotating fine-grained morphological tags (Schmid and Laws, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "12">For generating inflected forms based on stems and morphological features, we use an extended version of the finite-state morphology FRMOR (Zhou, 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "13">Additionally, we use a manually compiled list of abbreviations and named entities (names of countries) and their respective grammatical gender.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "14">Stemming For building the SMT system, the French data (parallel and monolingual) is transformed into a stemmed representation.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "15">Nouns, i.e. the heads of NPs or PPs, are marked with inflection-relevant features: gender is considered as part of the stem, whereas number is determined by the source-side input: for example, we expect source-language words in plural to be translated by translated by stems with plural markup.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "16">This stem- markup is necessary in order to guarantee that the number information is not lost during translation.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "17">For a better generalization, portmanteaus are split into separate parts: au → a` +le (meaning, “to the”).</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "18">Predicting morphological features For predicting the morphological features of the SMT output (number and gender), we use a linear chain CRF (Lavergne et al., 2010) trained on data annotated with these features using n-grams of stems and part- of-speech tags within a window of 4 positions to each side of the current word.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "19">Through the CRF, the values specified in the stem-markup (number and gender on nouns) are propagated over the rest of the linguistic phrase, as shown in column 2 of table 4.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "20">Based on the stems and the morphological features, inflected forms can be generated using FRMOR (column 3).</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "21">Post-processing As the French data has been normalized, a post-processing step is needed in order to generate correct French surface forms: split portmanteaus are merged into their regular forms based on a simple rule set.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "22">Furthermore, apostrophes are reintroduced for words like le, la, ne, ... if they are followed by a vowel.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "23">Column 4 in table 4 shows post-processing including portmanteau formation.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "24">Since we work on lowercased data, an additional recasing step is required.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "25">Experiments and evaluation We use the same set of reduced parallel data as the FREN system; the language model is built on 32M French sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "26">Results for the WMT2012 test set are given in table 5.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "27">Variant 1 shows the results for a small system trained only on a part of the training data (Europarl+News Commentary), whereas variant 2 corresponds to the submitted system.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "28">A small-scale analysis indicated that the inflection prediction system tends to have problems with subject-verb agreement.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "29">We trained a factored system using additional PoS-tags with number information which lead to a small improvement on both variants.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "30">While the small model is significantly better than the baseline2 as it benefits more from the generalization, the result for the full system is worse than the baseline3.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "31">Here, given the large amount of data, the generalization effect has less influence.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "32">However, we assume that the more general model from the inflection prediction system produces better translations than a regular model containing a large amount of irrelevant inflectional information, particularly when considering that it can produce well-formed inflected sequences that are inaccessible to the baseline.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "33">Even though this is not reflected in terms of BLEU, humans might prefer the inflection prediction system.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "34">For the WMT2013 set, we obtain BLEU scores of 29.6 (ci) and 28.30 (cs) with the inflection prediction system mes-inflection (marked in table 5).</S>

			<S sid ="90" ssid = "9">The data processed by Tree- Tagger contained errors such as wrong definition of PoS for adverbs, wrong selection of gender for adjectives in plural and missing features for pronouns and adverbs.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "10">In order to train RFTagger, the output of TreeTagger was corrected with a set of empirical rules.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "11">In particular, the morphological features of nominal phrases were made consistent to train RFTagger: in contrast to TreeTagger, where morphological features are regarded as part of the PoS-tag, RFTagger allows for a separate handling of morphological features and POS tags.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "12">Despite a generally good tagging quality, some errors seem to be unavoidable due to the ambiguity of certain grammatical forms in Russian.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "13">A good example of this are neuter nouns that have the same form in all cases, or feminine nouns, which have identical forms in singular genitive and plural nominative (Sharoff et al., 2008).</S>

			<S sid ="98" ssid = "17">Similar errors occur when specifying the case of adjectives, since the suffixes of adjectives are even less varied as compared to the nouns.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "18">In our application, we hope that this type of error does not affect the result due to the following suppression of a number of morphological attributes including the case of adjectives.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "19">Morphological reduction In comparison to Slavic languages, English is morphologically poor.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "20">For example, English has no morphological attributes for nouns and adjectives to express gender or case; verbs have no gender either.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "21">In contrast, Russian is morphologically very rich – there are e.g. 6 cases and 3 grammatical genders, which manifest themselves in different suffixes for nouns, pronouns, adjectives and some verb forms.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "22">When translating from Russian into English, many of these attributes are (hopefully) redundant and are therefore deleted from the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "23">The morphological reduction in our system was applied to nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions and conjunctions.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "24">The rest of the POS (adverbs, particles, interjections and abbreviations) have no morphological attributes.</S>

			<S sid ="156" ssid = "22">We also split German portmanteaus like zum → zu dem (meaning to the).</S>
			<S sid ="157" ssid = "23">Table 8: Results on WMT2013 (blindtest) English to German The task of mapping English SVO order to the different clausal orders in German is difficult.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "24">For our English to German systems, we solved this by parsing the English and applying the system of Gojun and Fraser (2012) to reorder English into the correct German clausal order (depending on the clause type which is detected using the English parse, see (Gojun and Fraser, 2012) for further details).</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "25">We primarily used the CharniakJohnson generative parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) to parse the English Europarl data and the test data.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "26">However, due to time constraints we additionally used Berkeley parses of about 400K Europarl sentences and the other English parallel training data.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "27">We also left a small amount of the English parallel training data unparsed, which means that it was not reordered.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "28">For tune, test and blindtest (WMT 2013), we used the CharniakJohnson generative parser.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "29">Experiments and results We used all available training data for constrained systems; results for the WMT2013 set are given in table 8.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "30">For the contrastive BitPar results, we reparsed WMT 2013.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "31">7 Conclusion We presented 5 systems dealing with complex morphology.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "32">For two language pairs with a morpho- logically rich source language (FR and RU), the input was reduced to a simplified representation containing only translation relevant morphological information (e.g. number on nouns).</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "33">We also used reordering techniques for DEEN and ENDE.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "34">For translating into a language with rich morphology (ENFR), we applied a two-step method that first translates into a stemmed representation of the target language and then generates inflected forms based on morphological features predicted on monolingual data.</S>
