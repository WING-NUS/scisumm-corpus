Abstract
While world knowledge has been shown to
improve learning-based coreference resolvers,
the improvements were typically obtained by
incorporating world knowledge into a fairly
weak baseline resolver. Hence, it is not clear
whether these benefits can carry over to a
stronger baseline. Moreover, since there has
been no attempt to apply different sources of
world knowledge in combination to corefer-
ence resolution, it is not clear whether they of-
fer complementary benefits to a resolver. We
systematically compare commonly-used and
under-investigated sources of world knowl-
edge for coreference resolution by applying
them to two learning-based coreference mod-
els and evaluating them on documents anno-
tated with two different annotation schemes.
1 Introduction
Noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution is the task
of determining which NPs in a text or dialogue refer
to the same real-world entity. The difficulty of the
task stems in part from its reliance on world knowl-
edge (Charniak, 1972). To exemplify, consider the
following text fragment.
Martha Stewart is hoping people don?t run out on her.
The celebrity indicted on charges stemming from . . .
Having the (world) knowledge that Martha Stewart
is a celebrity would be helpful for establishing the
coreference relation between the two NPs. One may
argue that employing heuristics such as subject pref-
erence or syntactic parallelism (which prefers re-
solving an NP to a candidate antecedent that has the
same grammatical role) in this example would also
allow us to correctly resolve the celebrity (Mitkov,
2002), thereby obviating the need for world knowl-
edge. However, since these heuristics are not per-
fect, complementing them with world knowledge
would be an important step towards bringing coref-
erence systems to the next level of performance.
Despite the usefulness of world knowledge for
coreference resolution, early learning-based coref-
erence resolvers have relied mostly on morpho-
syntactic features (e.g., Soon et al (2001), Ng and
Cardie (2002), Yang et al (2003)). With recent ad-
vances in lexical semantics research and the devel-
opment of large-scale knowledge bases, researchers
have begun to employ world knowledge for corefer-
ence resolution. World knowledge is extracted pri-
marily from three data sources, web-based encyclo-
pedia (e.g., Ponzetto and Strube (2006), Uryupina
et al (2011)), unannotated data (e.g., Daume? III
and Marcu (2005), Ng (2007)), and coreference-
annotated data (e.g., Bengtson and Roth (2008)).
While each of these three sources of world knowl-
edge has been shown to improve coreference resolu-
tion, the improvements were typically obtained by
incorporating world knowledge (as features) into a
baseline resolver composed of a rather weak coref-
erence model (i.e., the mention-pair model) and a
small set of features (i.e., the 12 features adopted
by Soon et al?s (2001) knowledge-lean approach).
As a result, some questions naturally arise. First,
can world knowledge still offer benefits when used
in combination with a richer set of features? Sec-
ond, since automatically extracted world knowledge
is typically noisy (Ponzetto and Poesio, 2009), are
recently-developed coreference models more noise-
tolerant than the mention-pair model, and if so, can
they profit more from the noisily extracted world
knowledge? Finally, while different world knowl-
814
edge sources have been shown to be useful when ap-
plied in isolation to a coreference system, do they of-
fer complementary benefits and therefore can further
improve a resolver when applied in combination?
We seek answers to these questions by conduct-
ing a systematic evaluation of different world knowl-
edge sources for learning-based coreference reso-
lution. Specifically, we (1) derive world knowl-
edge from encyclopedic sources that are under-
investigated for coreference resolution, including
FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998) and YAGO (Suchanek
et al, 2007), in addition to coreference-annotated
data and unannotated data; (2) incorporate such
knowledge as features into a richer baseline feature
set that we previously employed (Rahman and Ng,
2009); and (3) evaluate their utility using two coref-
erence models, the traditional mention-pair model
(Soon et al, 2001) and the recently developed
cluster-ranking model (Rahman and Ng, 2009).
Our evaluation corpus contains 410 documents,
which are coreference-annotated using the ACE an-
notation scheme as well as the OntoNotes annota-
tion scheme (Hovy et al, 2006). By evaluating on
two sets of coreference annotations for the same set
of documents, we can determine whether the use-
fulness of world knowledge sources for coreference
resolution is dependent on the underlying annotation
scheme used to annotate the documents.
2 Preliminaries
In this section, we describe the corpus, the NP ex-
traction methods, the coreference models, and the
evaluation measures we will use in our evaluation.
2.1 Data Set
We evaluate on documents that are coreference-
annotated using both the ACE annotation scheme
and the OntoNotes annotation scheme, so that we
can examine whether the usefulness of our world
knowledge sources is dependent on the underlying
coreference annotation scheme. Specifically, our
data set is composed of the 410 English newswire
articles that appear in both OntoNotes-2 and ACE
2004/2005. We partition the documents into a train-
ing set and a test set following a 80/20 ratio.
ACE and OntoNotes employ different guide-
lines to annotate coreference chains. A major
difference between the two annotation schemes is
that ACE only concerns establishing coreference
chains among NPs that belong to the ACE entity
types, whereas OntoNotes does not have this re-
striction. Hence, the OntoNotes annotation scheme
should produce more coreference chains (i.e., non-
singleton coreference clusters) than the ACE anno-
tation scheme for a given set of documents. For our
data set, the OntoNotes scheme yielded 4500 chains,
whereas the ACE scheme yielded only 3637 chains.
Another difference between the two annotation
schemes is that singleton clusters are annotated in
ACE but not OntoNotes. As discussed below, the
presence of singleton clusters may have an impact
on NP extraction and coreference evaluation.
2.2 NP Extraction
Following common practice, we employ different
methods to extract NPs from the documents anno-
tated with the two annotation schemes.
To extract NPs from the ACE-annotated docu-
ments, we train a mention extractor on the train-
ing texts (see Section 5.1 of Rahman and Ng (2009)
for details), which recalls 83.6% of the NPs in the
test set. On the other hand, to extract NPs from the
OntoNotes-annotated documents, the same method
should not be applied. To see the reason, recall that
only the NPs in non-singleton clusters are annotated
in these documents. Training a mention extractor
on these NPs implies that we are learning to ex-
tract non-singleton NPs, which are typically much
smaller in number than the entire set of NPs. In
other words, doing so could substantially simplify
the coreference task. Consequently, we follow the
approach adopted by traditional learning-based re-
solvers and employ an NP chunker to extract NPs.
Specifically, we use the markable identification sys-
tem in the Reconcile resolver (Stoyanov et al, 2010)
to extract NPs from the training and test texts. This
identifier recalls 77.4% of the NPs in the test set.
2.3 Coreference Models
We evaluate the utility of world knowledge using the
mention-pair model and the cluster-ranking model.
2.3.1 Mention-Pair Model
The mention-pair (MP) model is a classifier that
determines whether two NPs are coreferent or not.
815
Each instance i(NPj , NPk) corresponds to NPj and
NPk, and is represented by a Baseline feature set con-
sisting of 39 features. Linguistically, these features
can be divided into four categories: string-matching,
grammatical, semantic, and positional. These fea-
tures can also be categorized based on whether they
are relational or not. Relational features capture
the relationship between NPj and NPk, whereas non-
relational features capture the linguistic property of
one of these two NPs. Since space limitations pre-
clude a description of these features, we refer the
reader to Rahman and Ng (2009) for details.
We follow Soon et al?s (2001) method for cre-
ating training instances: we create (1) a positive
instance for each anaphoric NP, NPk, and its clos-
est antecedent, NPj ; and (2) a negative instance for
NPk paired with each of the intervening NPs, NPj+1,
NPj+2, . . ., NPk?1. The classification of a training
instance is either positive or negative, depending on
whether the two NPs are coreferent in the associated
text. To train the MP model, we use the SVM learn-
ing algorithm from SVMlight (Joachims, 2002).1
After training, the classifier is used to identify an
antecedent for an NP in a test text. Specifically, each
NP, NPk , is compared in turn to each preceding NP,
NPj , from right to left, and NPj is selected as its an-
tecedent if the pair is classified as coreferent. The
process terminates as soon as an antecedent is found
for NPk or the beginning of the text is reached.
Despite its popularity, the MP model has two
major weaknesses. First, since each candidate an-
tecedent for an NP to be resolved (henceforth an ac-
tive NP) is considered independently of the others,
this model only determines how good a candidate
antecedent is relative to the active NP, but not how
good a candidate antecedent is relative to other can-
didates. So, it fails to answer the critical question of
which candidate antecedent is most probable. Sec-
ond, it has limitations in its expressiveness: the in-
formation extracted from the two NPs alone may not
be sufficient for making a coreference decision.
2.3.2 Cluster-Ranking Model
The cluster-ranking (CR) model addresses the two
weaknesses of the MP model by combining the
strengths of the entity-mention model (e.g., Luo et
1For this and subsequent uses of the SVM learner in our
experiments, we set al parameters to their default values.
al. (2004), Yang et al (2008)) and the mention-
ranking model (e.g., Denis and Baldridge (2008)).
Specifically, the CR model ranks the preceding clus-
ters for an active NP so that the highest-ranked clus-
ter is the one to which the active NP should be
linked. Employing a ranker addresses the first weak-
ness, as a ranker allows all candidates to be com-
pared simultaneously. Considering preceding clus-
ters rather than antecedents as candidates addresses
the second weakness, as cluster-level features (i.e.,
features that are defined over any subset of NPs in a
preceding cluster) can be employed. Details of the
CR model can be found in Rahman and Ng (2009).
Since the CR model ranks preceding clusters, a
training instance i(cj , NPk) represents a preceding
cluster, cj , and an anaphoric NP, NPk. Each instance
consists of features that are computed based solely
on NPk as well as cluster-level features, which de-
scribe the relationship between cj and NPk . Mo-
tivated in part by Culotta et al (2007), we create
cluster-level features from the relational features in
our feature set using four predicates: NONE, MOST-
FALSE, MOST-TRUE, and ALL. Specifically, for each
relational feature X, we first convert X into an equiv-
alent set of binary-valued features if it is multi-
valued. Then, for each resulting binary-valued fea-
ture Xb, we create four binary-valued cluster-level
features: (1) NONE-Xb is true when Xb is false be-
tween NPk and each NP in cj ; (2) MOST-FALSE-Xb
is true when Xb is true between NPk and less than half
(but at least one) of the NPs in cj ; (3) MOST-TRUE-
Xb is true when Xb is true between NPk and at least
half (but not all) of the NPs in cj ; and (4) ALL-Xb is
true when Xb is true between NPk and each NP in cj .
We train a cluster ranker to jointly learn
anaphoricity determination and coreference reso-
lution using SVMlight?s ranker-learning algorithm.
Specifically, for each NP, NPk, we create a training
instance between NPk and each preceding cluster cj
using the features described above. Since we are
learning a joint model, we need to provide the ranker
with the option to start a new cluster by creating an
additional training instance that contains the non-
relational features describing NPk . The rank value
of a training instance i(cj , NPk) created for NPk is the
rank of cj among the competing clusters. If NPk is
anaphoric, its rank is HIGH if NPk belongs to cj , and
LOW otherwise. If NPk is non-anaphoric, its rank is
816
LOW unless it is the additional training instance de-
scribed above, which has rank HIGH.
After training, the cluster ranker processes the
NPs in a test text in a left-to-right manner. For each
active NP, NPk , we create test instances for it by pair-
ing it with each of its preceding clusters. To allow
for the possibility that NPk is non-anaphoric, we cre-
ate an additional test instance as during training. All
these test instances are then presented to the ranker.
If the additional test instance is assigned the highest
rank value, then we create a new cluster containing
NPk. Otherwise, NPk is linked to the cluster that has
the highest rank. Note that the partial clusters pre-
ceding NPk are formed incrementally based on the
predictions of the ranker for the first k ? 1 NPs.
2.4 Evaluation Measures
We employ two commonly-used scoring programs,
B3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and CEAF (Luo,
2005), both of which report results in terms of recall
(R), precision (P), and F-measure (F) by comparing
the gold-standard (i.e., key) partition, KP , against
the system-generated (i.e., response) partition, RP .
Briefly, B3 computes the R and P values of each
NP and averages these values at the end. Specifi-
cally, for each NP, NPj , B3 first computes the number
of common NPs in KPj and RPj , the clusters con-
taining NPj in KP and RP , respectively, and then
divides this number by |KPj | and |RPj | to obtain
the R and P values of NPj , respectively. On the other
hand, CEAF finds the best one-to-one alignment be-
tween the key clusters and the response clusters.
A complication arises when B3 is used to score
a response partition containing automatically ex-
tracted NPs. Recall that B3 constructs a mapping
between the NPs in the response and those in the
key. Hence, if the response is generated using gold-
standard NPs, then every NP in the response is
mapped to some NP in the key and vice versa. In
other words, there are no twinless (i.e., unmapped)
NPs (Stoyanov et al, 2009). This is not the case
when automatically extracted NPs are used, but the
original description of B3 does not specify how
twinless NPs should be scored (Bagga and Baldwin,
1998). To address this problem, we set the recall
and precision of a twinless NP to zero, regardless of
whether the NP appears in the key or the response.
Note that CEAF can compare partitions with twin-
less NPs without any modification, since it operates
by finding the best alignment between the clusters in
the two partitions.
Additionally, in order not to over-penalize a re-
sponse partition, we remove all the twinless NPs in
the response that are singletons. The rationale is
simple: since the resolver has successfully identified
these NPs as singletons, it should not be penalized,
and removing them avoids such penalty.
Since B3 and CEAF align NPs/clusters, the lack
of singleton clusters in the OntoNotes annotations
implies that the resulting scores reflect solely how
well a resolver identifies coreference links and do
not take into account how well it identifies singleton
clusters.
3 Extracting World Knowledge
In this section, we describe how we extract world
knowledge for coreference resolution from three
different sources: large-scale knowledge bases,
coreference-annotated data and unannotated data.
3.1 World Knowledge from Knowledge Bases
We extract world knowledge from two large-scale
knowledge bases, YAGO and FrameNet.
3.1.1 Extracting Knowledge from YAGO
We choose to employ YAGO rather than the more
popularly-used Wikipedia due to its potentially
richer knowledge, which comprises 5 million facts
extracted from Wikipedia and WordNet. Each fact
is represented as a triple (NPj , rel, NPk), where rel
is one of the 90 YAGO relation types defined on
two NPs, NPj and NPk . Motivated in part by previ-
ous work (Bryl et al, 2010; Uryupina et al, 2011),
we employ the two relation types that we believe
are most useful for coreference resolution, TYPE
and MEANS. TYPE is essentially an IS-A relation.
For instance, the triple (AlbertEinstein, TYPE,
physicist) denotes the fact that Albert Einstein
is a physicist. MEANS provides different ways of
expressing an entity, and therefore allows us to deal
with synonymy and ambiguity. For instance, the two
triples (Einstein, MEANS, AlbertEinstein)
and (Einstein, MEANS, AlfredEinstein)
denote the facts that Einstein may refer to the physi-
cist Albert Einstein and the musicologist Alfred Ein-
stein, respectively. Hence, the presence of one or
817
both of these relations between two NPs provides
strong evidence that the two NPs are coreferent.
YAGO?s unification of the information in
Wikipedia and WordNet enables it to extract
facts that cannot be extracted with Wikipedia
or WordNet alne, such as (MarthaStewart,
TYPE, celebrity). To better appreciate YAGO?s
strengths, let us see how this fact was extracted.
YAGO first heuristically maps each of the Wiki
categories in the Wiki page for Martha Stewart
to its semantically closest WordNet synset. For
instance, the Wiki category AMERICAN TELE-
VISION PERSONALITIES is mapped to the synset
corresponding to sense #2 of the word personality.
Then, given that personality is a direct hyponym of
celebrity in WordNet, YAGO extracts the desired
fact. This enables YAGO to extract facts that cannot
be extracted with Wikipedia or WordNet alne.
We incorporate the world knowledge from YAGO
into our coreference models as a binary-valued fea-
ture. If the MP model is used, the YAGO feature
for an instance will have the value 1 if and only if
the two NPs involved are in a TYPE or MEANS re-
lation. On the other hand, if the CR model is used,
the YAGO feature for an instance involving NPk and
preceding cluster c will have the value 1 if and only
if NPk has a TYPE or MEANS relation with any of
the NPs in c. Since knowledge extraction from web-
based encyclopedia is typically noisy (Ponzetto and
Poesio, 2009), we use YAGO to determine whether
two NPs have a relation only if one NP is a named
entity (NE) of type person, organization, or location
according to the Stanford NE recognizer (Finkel et
al., 2005) and the other NP is a common noun.
3.1.2 Extracting Knowledge from FrameNet
FrameNet is a lexico-semantic resource focused on
semantic frames (Baker et al, 1998). As a schematic
representation of a situation, a frame contains the
lexical predicates that can invoke it as well as the
frame elements (i.e., semantic roles). For example,
the JUDGMENT COMMUNICATION frame describes
situations in which a COMMUNICATOR communi-
cates a judgment of an EVALUEE to an ADDRESSEE.
This frame has COMMUNICATOR and EVALUEE as
its core frame elements and ADDRESSEE as its non-
core frame elements, and can be invoked by more
than 40 predicates, such as acclaim, accuse, com-
mend, decry, denounce, praise, and slam.
To better understand why FrameNet contains po-
tentially useful knowledge for coreference resolu-
tion, consider the following text segment:
Peter Anthony decries program trading as ?limiting the
game to a few,? but he is not sure whether he wants to
denounce it because ...
To establish the coreference relation between it and
program trading, it may be helpful to know that de-
cry and denounce appear in the same frame and the
two NPs have the same semantic role.
This example suggests that features encoding both
the semantic roles of the two NPs under considera-
tion and whether the associated predicates are ?re-
lated? to each other in FrameNet (i.e., whether they
appear in the same frame) could be useful for iden-
tifying coreference relations. Two points regarding
our implementation of these features deserve men-
tion. First, since we do not employ verb sense dis-
ambiguation, we consider two predicates related as
long as there is at least one semantic frame in which
they both appear. Second, since FrameNet-style se-
mantic role labelers are not publicly available, we
use ASSERT (Pradhan et al, 2004), a semantic role
labeler that provides PropBank-style semantic roles
such as ARG0 (the PROTOAGENT, which is typi-
cally the subject of a transitive verb) and ARG1 (the
PROTOPATIENT, which is typically its direct object).
Now, assuming that NPj and NPk are the argu-
ments of two stemmed predicates, predj and predk ,
we create 15 features using the knowledge extracted
from FrameNet and ASSERT as follows. First, we
encode the knowledge extracted from FrameNet as
one of three possible values: (1) predj and predk
are in the same frame; (2) they are both predicates
in FrameNet but never appear in the same frame;
and (3) one or both predicates do not appear in
FrameNet. Second, we encode the semantic roles of
NPj and NPk as one of five possible values: ARG0-
ARG0, ARG1-ARG1, ARG0-ARG1, ARG1-ARG0,
and OTHERS (the default case).2 Finally, we create
15 binary-valued features by pairing the 3 possible
values extracted from FrameNet and the 5 possible
values provided by ASSERT. Since these features
2We focus primarily on ARG0 and ARG1 because they are
the most important core arguments of a predicate and may pro-
vide more useful information than other semantic roles.
818
are computed over two NPs, we can employ them di-
rectly for the MP model. Note that by construction,
exactly one of these features will have a non-zero
value. For the CR model, we extend their definitions
so that they can be computed between an NP, NPk,
and a preceding cluster, c. Specifically, the value of
a feature is 1 if and only if its value between NPk and
one of the NPs in c is 1 under its original definition.
The above discussion assumes that the two NPs
under consideration serve as predicate arguments. If
this assumption fails, we will not create any features
based on FrameNet for these two NPs.
To our knowledge, FrameNet has not been ex-
ploited for coreference resolution. However, the
use of related verbs is similar in spirit to Bean and
Riloff?s (2004) use of patterns for inducing contex-
tual role knowledge, and the use of semantic roles is
also discussed in Ponzetto and Strube (2006).
3.2 World Knowledge from Annotated Data
Since world knowledge is needed for coreference
resolution, a human annotator must have employed
world knowledge when coreference-annotating a
document. We aim to design features that can ?re-
cover? such world knowledge from annotated data.
3.2.1 Features Based on Noun Pairs
A natural question is: what kind of world knowl-
edge can we extract from annotated data? We may
gather the knowledge that Barack Obama is a U.S.
president if we see these two NPs appearing in the
same coreference chain. Equally importantly, we
may gather the commonsense knowledge needed for
determining non-coreference. For instance, we may
discover that a lion and a tiger are unlikely to refer
to the same real-world entity after realizing that they
never appear in the same chain in a large number of
annotated documents. Note that any features com-
puted based on WordNet distance or distributional
similarity are likely to incorrectly suggest that lion
and tiger are coreferent, since the two nouns are sim-
ilar distributionally and according to WordNet.
Given these observations, one may collect the
noun pairs from the (coreference-annotated) train-
ing data and use them as features to train a resolver.
However, for these features to be effective, we need
to address data sparseness, as many noun pairs in
the training data may not appear in the test data.
To improve generalization, we instead create dif-
ferent kinds of noun-pair-based features given an
annotated text. To begin with, we preprocess each
document. A training text is preprocessed by ran-
domly replacing 10% of its common nouns with the
label UNSEEN. If an NP, NPk , is replaced with UN-
SEEN, all NPs that have the same string as NPk will
also be replaced with UNSEEN. A test text is prepro-
cessed differently: we simply replace all NPs whose
strings are not seen in the training data with UN-
SEEN. Hence, artificially creating UNSEEN labels
from a training text will allow a learner to learn how
to handle unseen words in a test text.
Next, we create noun-pair-based features for the
MP model, which will be used to augment the Base-
line feature set. Here, each instance corresponds to
two NPs, NPj and NPk , and is represented by three
groups of binary-valued features.
Unseen features are applicable when both NPj
and NPk are UNSEEN. Either an UNSEEN-SAME fea-
ture or an UNSEEN-DIFF feature is created, depend-
ing on whether the two NPs are the same string be-
fore being replaced with the UNSEEN token.
Lexical features are applicable when neither NPj
nor NPk is UNSEEN. A lexical feature is an ordered
pair consisting of the heads of the NPs. For a pro-
noun or a common noun, the head is the last word of
the NP; for a proper name, the head is the entire NP.
Semi-lexical features aim to improve generaliza-
tion, and are applicable when neither NPj nor NPk is
UNSEEN. If exactly one of NPj and NPk is tagged
as a NE by the Stanford NE recognizer, we create
a semi-lexical feature that is identical to the lexical
feature described above, except that the NE is re-
placed with its NE label. On the other hand, if both
NPs are NEs, we check whether they are the same
string. If so, we create a *NE*-SAME feature, where
*NE* is replaced with the corresponding NE label.
Otherwise, we check whether they have the same NE
tag and a word-subset match (i.e., whether the word
tokens in one NP appears in the other?s list of word
tokens). If so, we create a *NE*-SUBSAME feature,
where *NE* is replaced with their NE label. Other-
wise, we create a feature that is the concatenation of
the NE labels of the two NPs.
The noun-pair-based features for the CR model
can be generated using essentially the same method.
Specifically, since each instance now corresponds to
819
an NP, NPk, and a preceding cluster, c, we can gener-
ate a noun-pair-based feature by applying the above
method to NPk and each of the NPs in c, and its value
is the number of times it is applicable to NPk and c.
3.2.2 Features Based on Verb Pairs
As discussed above, features encoding the seman-
tic roles of two NPs and the relatedness of the asso-
ciated verbs could be useful for coreference resolu-
tion. Rather than encoding verb relatedness, we may
replace verb relatedness with the verbs themselves
in these features, and have the learner learn directly
from coreference-annotated data whether two NPs
serving as the objects of decry and denounce are
likely to be coreferent or not, for instance.
Specifically, assuming that NPj and NPk are the
arguments of two stemmed predicates, predj and
predk , in the training data, we create five features
as follows. First, we encode the semantic roles of
NPj and NPk as one of five possible values: ARG0-
ARG0, ARG1-ARG1, ARG0-ARG1, ARG1-ARG0,
and OTHERS (the default case). Second, we create
five binary-valued features by pairing each of these
five values with the two stemmed predicates. Since
these features are computed over two NPs, we can
employ them directly for the MP model. Note that
by construction, exactly one of these features will
have a non-zero value. For the CR model, we extend
their definitions so that they can be computed be-
tween an NP, NPk , and a preceding cluster, c. Specif-
ically, the value of a feature is 1 if and only if its
value between NPk and one of the NPs in c is 1 un-
der its original definition.
The above discussion assumes that the two NPs
under consideration serve as predicate arguments. If
this assumption fails, we will not create any features
based on verb pairs for these two NPs.
3.3 World Knowledge from Unannotated Data
Previous work has shown that syntactic apposi-
tions, which can be extracted using heuristics from
unannotated documents or parse trees, are a useful
source of world knowledge for coreference resolu-
tion (e.g., Daume? III and Marcu (2005), Ng (2007),
Haghighi and Klein (2009)). Each extraction is an
NP pair such as <Barack Obama, the president>
and <Eastern Airlines, the carrier>, where the first
NP in the pair is a proper name and the second NP is
a common NP. Low-frequency extractions are typi-
cally assumed to be noisy and discarded.
We combine the extractions produced by Fleis-
chman et al (2003) and Ng (2007) to form a
database consisting of 1.057 million NP pairs, and
create a binary-valued feature for our coreference
models using this database. If the MP model is used,
this feature will have the value 1 if and only if the
two NPs appear as a pair in the database. On the
other hand, if the CR model is used, the feature for
an instance involving NPk and preceding cluster c
will have the value 1 if and only if NPk and at least
one of the NPs in c appears as a pair in the database.
4 Evaluation
4.1 Experimental Setup
As described in Section 2, we use as our evalua-
tion corpus the 411 documents that are coreference-
annotated using the ACE and OntoNotes annota-
tion schemes. Specifically, we divide these docu-
ments into five (disjoint) folds of roughly the same
size, training the MP model and the CR model us-
ing SVMlight on four folds and evaluate their per-
formance on the remaining fold. The linguistic fea-
tures, as well as the NPs used to create the training
and test instances, are computed automatically. We
employ B3 and CEAF as described in Section 2.3 to
score the output of a coreference system.
4.2 Results and Discussion
4.2.1 Baseline Models
Since our goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of
the features encoding world knowledge for learning-
based coreference resolution, we employ as our
baselines the MR model and the CR model trained
on the Baseline feature set, which does not con-
tain any features encoding world knowledge. For
the MP model, the Baseline feature set consists of
the 39 features described in Section 2.3.1; for the
CR model, the Baseline feature set consists of the
cluster-level features derived from the 39 features
used in the Baseline MP model (see Section 2.3.2).
Results of the MP model and the CR model em-
ploying the Baseline feature set are shown in rows 1
and 8 of Table 1, respectively. Each row contains the
B3 and CEAF results of the corresponding corefer-
ence model when it is evaluated using the ACE and

OntoNotes annotations as the gold standard. As we
can see, the MP model achieves F-measure scores of
62.4 (B3) and 60.0 (CEAF) on ACE and 53.3 (B3)
and 51.5 (CEAF) on OntoNotes, and the CR model
achieves F-measure scores of 66.1 (B3) and 63.8
(CEAF) on ACE and 56.2 (B3) and 54.0 (CEAF)
on OntoNotes. Also, the results show that the CR
model is stronger than the MP model, corroborating
previous empirical findings (Rahman and Ng, 2009).
4.2.2 Incorporating World Knowledge
Next, we examine the usefulness of world knowl-
edge for coreference resolution. The remaining rows
in Table 1 show the results obtained when different
types of features encoding world knowledge are ap-
plied to the Baseline system in isolation. The best
result for each combination of data set, evaluation
measure, and coreference model is boldfaced.
Two points deserve mention. First, each type
of features improves the Baseline, regardless of the
coreference model, the evaluation measure, and the
annotation scheme used. This suggests that all these
feature types are indeed useful for coreference reso-
lution. It is worth noting that in all but a few cases
involving the FrameNet-based and appositive-based
features, the rise in F-measure is accompanied by a
821
1. The Bush White House is breeding non-duck ducks the same way the Nixon White House did: It hops on an
issue that is unopposable ? cleaner air, better treatment of the disabled, better child care. The President came
up with a good bill, but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on Capitol Hill.
2. The tumor, he suggested, developed when the second, normal copy also was damaged. He believed colon
cancer might also arise from multiple ?hits? on cancer suppressor genes, as it often seems to develop in stages.

simultaneous rise in recall and precision. This is per-
haps not surprising: as the use of world knowledge
helps discover coreference links, recall increases;
and as more (relevant) knowledge is available to
make coreference decisions, precision increases.
Second, the feature types that yield the best im-
provement over the Baseline are YAGO TYPE and
Noun Pairs. When the MP model is used, the best
coreference system improves the Baseline by 1?
1.3% (B3) and 1.3?2.8% (CEAF) in F-measure. On
the other hand, when the CR model is used, the best
system improves the Baseline by 2.3?2.6% (B3) and
1.7?2.2% (CEAF) in F-measure.
Table 2 shows the results obtained when the dif-
ferent types of features are added to the Baseline one
after the other. Specifically, we add the feature types
in this order: YAGO TYPE, YAGO MEANS, Noun
Pairs, FrameNet, Verb Pairs, and Appositives. In
comparison to the results in Table 1, we can see that
better results are obtained when the different types
of features are applied to the Baseline in combina-
tion than in isolation, regardless of the coreference
model, the evaluation measure, and the annotation
scheme used. The best-performing system, which
employs all but the Appositive features, outperforms
the Baseline by 3.1?3.3% in F-measure when the
MR model is used and by 4.1?4.8% in F-measure
when the CR model is used. In both cases, the
gains in F-measure are accompanied by a simulta-
neous rise in recall and precision. Overall, these
results seem to suggest that the CR model is mak-
ing more effective use of the available knowledge
than the MR model, and that the different feature
types are providing complementary information for
the two coreference models.
4.3 Example Errors
While the different types of features we considered
improve the performance of the Baseline primarily
via the establishment of coreference links, some of
these links are spurious. Sentences 1 and 2 of Table
3 show the spurious coreference links introduced by
the CR model when YAGO and FrameNet are used,
respectively. In sentence 1, while The President and
Bush are coreferent, YAGO caused the CR model
to establish the spurious link between The President
and Nixon owing to the proximity of the two NPs
and the presence of this NP pair in the YAGO TYPE
relation. In sentence 2, FrameNet caused the CR
model to establish the spurious link between The tu-
mor and colon cancer because these two NPs are the
ARG0 arguments of develop and arise, which appear
in the same semantic frame in FrameNet.
5 Conclusions
We have examined the utility of three major
sources of world knowledge for coreference resolu-
tion, namely, large-scale knowledge bases (YAGO,
FrameNet), coreference-annotated data (Noun Pairs,
Verb Pairs), and unannotated data (Appositives), by
applying them to two learning-based coreference
models, the mention-pair model and the cluster-
ranking model, and evaluating them on documents
annotated with the ACE and OntoNotes annotation
schemes. When applying the different types of fea-
tures in isolation to a Baseline system that does not
employ world knowledge, we found that all of them
improved the Baseline regardless of the underlying
coreference model, the evaluation measure, and the
annotation scheme, with YAGO TYPE and Noun
Pairs yielding the largest performance gains. Nev-
ertheless, the best results were obtained when they
were applied in combination to the Baseline system.
We conclude from these results that the different fea-
ture types we considered are providing complemen-
tary world knowledge to the coreference resolvers,
and while each of them provides fairly small gains,
their cumulative benefits can be substantial.
