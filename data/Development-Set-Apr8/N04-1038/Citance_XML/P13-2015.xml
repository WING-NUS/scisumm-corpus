			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Coreference resolvers are typically evaluated on collections of news articles that cover a wide range of topics, such as the ACE (ACE03, 2003; ACE04, 2004; ACE05, 2005) and OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2007) data sets.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Many NLP applications, however, involve text analysis for specialized domains, such as clinical medicine (Gooch and Roudsari, 2012; Glinos, 2011), legal text analysis (BouayadAgha et al., 2009), and biological literature (BatistaNavarro and Ananiadou, 2011; Castan˜ o et al., 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Learning-based coreference resolvers can be easily retrained for a specialized domain given annotated training texts for that domain.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">However, we found that retraining an off-the-shelf coreference resolver with domain- specific texts showed little benefit.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">This surprising result led us to question the nature of the feature sets used by noun phrase (NP) coreference resolvers.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Nearly all of the features employed by recent systems fall into three categories: string match and word overlap, syntactic properties (e.g., appositives, predicate nominals, parse features, etc.), and semantic matching (e.g., gender agreement, WordNet similarity, named entity classes, etc.).</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Conspicuously absent from most systems are lexical features that allow the classifier to consider the specific words when making a coreference decision.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">A few researchers have experimented with lexical features, but they achieved mixed results in evaluations on broad-coverage corpora (Bengston and Roth, 2008; Bjo¨ rkelund and Nugues, 2011; Rahman and Ng, 2011a).</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">We hypothesized that lexicalized features can have a more substantial impact in domain-specific settings.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Lexical features can capture domain- specific knowledge and subtle semantic distinctions that may be important within a domain.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">For example, based on the resolutions found in domain-specific training sets, our lexicalized features captured the knowledge that “tomcat” can be coreferent with “plane”, “UAW” can be coreferent with “union”, and “anthrax” can be coreferent with “diagnosis”.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Capturing these types of domain-specific information is often impossible using only general-purpose resources.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">For example, WordNet defines “tomcat” only as an animal, does not contain an entry for “UAW”, and categorizes “anthrax” and “diagnosis” very differently.1 In this paper, we evaluate the impact of lexicalized features on 4 domains: management succession (MUC6 data), vehicle launches (MUC7 data), disease outbreaks (ProMed texts), and terrorism (MUC4 data).</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">We incorporate lexical- ized feature sets into two different coreference architectures: Reconcile (Stoyanov et al., 2010), a pairwise coreference classifier, and Sieve (Raghunathan et al., 2010), a rule-based system.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Our results show that lexicalized features significantly improve performance in all four domains and in both types of coreference architectures.</S>

			<S sid ="36" ssid = "18">The results showed that the best performance came from training and testing with lexical knowledge drawn from the same source.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "19">Although our approach is similar, this paper focuses on learning lexical information from different domains as opposed to the different genres found in the six sources of the ACE05 corpus.</S>

			<S sid ="44" ssid = "26">Ng (2007) used lexical information to assess the likelihood of a noun phrase being anaphoric, but this did not show clear improvements on ACE data.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "27">There has been previous work on domain- specific coreference resolution for several domains, including biological literature (Castan˜ o et al., 2002; Liang and Lin, 2005; Gasperin and Briscoe, 2008; Kim et al., 2011; BatistaNavarro and Ananiadou, 2011), clinical medicine (He, 2007; Zheng et al., 2011; Glinos, 2011; Gooch and Roudsari, 2012) and legal documents (BouayadAgha et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "28">In addition, BABAR (Bean and Riloff, 2004) used contextual role knowledge for coreference resolution in the domains of terrorism and natural disasters.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "29">But BABAR acquired and used lexical information to match the compatibility of contexts surrounding NPs, not the NPs themselves.</S>

			<S sid ="100" ssid = "52">We discard pairs that include a pronoun, and nor malize strings to lower case for consistency.</S>

			<S sid ="102" ssid = "54">We explore two ways to capture lexicalized information as features.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "55">The first approach indicates whether two CEs have ever been coreferent in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "56">We create a single feature called LEXLOOKUP(X,Y) that receives a value of 1 when x and y have been coreferent at least twice, or a value of 0 otherwise.2 LEXLOOKUP(X,Y) is a single feature that captures all CE pairs that were coreferent in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "57">We also created set-based features that capture the set of terms that have been coreferent with a particular CE.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "58">The C oref Set(x) is the set of CEs that have appeared in the same coreference chain as mention x at least twice.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "59">We create a set of binary-valued features LEXSET(X,Y), one for each CE x in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "60">Given a pair of CEs, x and y, LEXSET(X,Y)= 1 if y ∈ C oref Set(x), or 0 otherwise.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "61">The benefit of the set-based features over a single mono lithic feature is that the classifier has one set-based feature for each mention found in the training data, so it can learn to handle individual terms differently.</S>
