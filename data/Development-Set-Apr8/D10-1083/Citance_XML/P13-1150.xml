			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Over the past centuries, dozens of lost languages have been deciphered through the painstaking work of scholars, often after decades of slow progress and dead ends.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">However, several important writing systems and languages remain unde- ciphered to this day.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">In this paper, we present a successful solution to one aspect of the decipherment puzzle: automatically identifying basic phonetic properties of letters in an unknown alphabetic writing system.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Our key idea is to use knowledge of the phonetic regularities encoded in known language vocabularies to automatically build a universal probabilistic model to successfully decode new languages.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Our approach adopts a classical Bayesian perspective.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">We assume that each language has an unobserved set of parameters explaining its observed vocabulary.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">We further assume that each language-specific set of parameters was itself drawn from an unobserved common prior, shared across a cluster of typologically related languages.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">In turn, each cluster derives its parameters from a universal prior common to all language groups.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">This approach allows us to mix together data from languages with various levels of observations and perform joint posterior inference over unobserved variables of interest.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">At the bottom layer (see Figure 1), our model assumes a language-specific data generating HMM over words in the language vocabulary.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Each word is modeled as an emitted sequence of characters, depending on a corresponding Markov sequence of phonetic tags.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Since individual letters are highly constrained in their range of phonetic values, we make the assumption of one-tag-per- observation-type (e.g. a single letter is constrained to be always a consonant or always a vowel across all words in a language).</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Going one layer up, we posit that the language- specific HMM parameters are themselves drawn from informative, non-symmetric distributions representing a typologically coherent language grouping.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">By applying the model to a mix of languages with observed and unobserved phonetic sequences, the cluster-level distributions can be inferred and help guide prediction for unknown languages and alphabets.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">We apply this approach to two small decipher- ment tasks: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">predicting whether individual characters in an unknown alphabet and language represent vowels or consonants, and 2.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">predicting whether individual characters in an unknown alphabet and language represent vowels, nasals, or non-nasal consonants.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">For both tasks, our approach yields considerable 1527 Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1527–1536, Sofia, Bulgaria, August 49 2013.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Qc 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics success.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">We experiment with a data set consisting of vocabularies of 503 languages from around the world, written in a mix of Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek alphabets.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">In turn for each language, we consider it and its alphabet “unobserved” — we hide the graphic and phonetic properties of the symbols — while treating the vocabularies of the remaining languages as fully observed with phonetic tags on each of the letters.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">On average, over these 503 leave-one-language- out scenarios, our model predicts consonant/vowel distinctions with 99% accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">In the more challenging task of vowel/nasal/non-nasal prediction, our model achieves average accuracy over 89%.</S>

			<S sid ="29" ssid = "1">The most direct precedent to the present work is a section in Knight et al.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "2">(2006) on universal phonetic decipherment.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "3">They build a trigram HMM with three hidden states, corresponding to consonants, vowels, and spaces.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "4">As in our model, individual characters are treated as the observed emissions of the hidden states.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "5">In contrast to the present work, they allow letters to be emitted by multiple states.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "6">Their experiments show that the HMM trained with EM successfully clusters Spanish letters into consonants and vowels.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "7">They further design a more sophisticated finite-state model, based on linguistic universals regarding syllable structure and sonority.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "8">Experiments with the second model indicate that it can distinguish sonorous consonants (such as n, m, l, r) from non-sonorous consonants in Spanish.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "9">An advantage of the linguistically structured model is that its predictions do not require an additional mapping step from uninterpreted hidden states to linguistic categories, as they do with the HMM.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "10">Our model and experiments can be viewed as complementary to the work of Knight et al., while also extending it to hundreds of languages.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "11">We use the simple HMM with EM as our baseline.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "12">In lieu of a linguistically designed model structure, we choose an empirical approach, allowing posterior inference over hundreds of known languages to guide the model’s decisions for the unknown script and language.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "13">In this sense, our model bears some similarity to the decipherment model of Snyder et al.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "14">(2010), which used knowledge of a related language (He cipher the ancient language of Ugaritic.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "15">While the aim of the present work is more modest (discovering very basic phonetic properties of letters) it is also more widely applicable, as we don’t required detailed analysis of a known related language.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "16">Other recent work has employed a similar perspective for tying learning across languages.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "17">Naseem et al.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "18">(2009) use a non-parametric Bayesian model over parallel text to jointly learn part-of-speech taggers across 8 languages, while Cohen and Smith (2009) develop a shared logistic normal prior to couple multilingual learning even in the absence of parallel text.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "19">In similar veins, Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein (2010) develop hierarchically tied grammar priors over languages within the same family, and Bouchard- Côté et al.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "20">(2013) develop a probabilistic model of sound change using data from 637 Austronesian languages.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "21">In our own previous work, we have developed the idea that supervised knowledge of some number of languages can help guide the unsupervised induction of linguistic structure, even in the absence of parallel text (Kim et al., 2011; Kim andSnyder, 2012)1.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "22">In the latter work we also tack led the problem of unsupervised phonemic prediction for unknown languages by using textual regularities of known languages.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "23">However, we assumed that the target language was written in a known (Latin) alphabet, greatly reducing the difficulty of the prediction task.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "24">In our present case, we assume no knowledge of any relationship between the writing system of the target language and known languages, other than that they are all alphabetic in nature.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "25">Finally, we note some similarities of our model to some ideas proposed in other contexts.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "26">We make the assumption that each observation type (letter) occurs with only one hidden state (consonant or vowel).</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "27">Similar constraints have been developed for part-of-speech tagging (Lee et al., 2010; Christodoulopoulos et al., 2011), and the power of type-based sampling has been demonstrated, even in the absence of explicit model constraints (Liang et al., 2010).</S>

			<S sid ="56" ssid = "1">Our generative Bayesian model over the observed vocabularies of hundreds of languages is 1 We note that similar ideas were simultaneously proposed.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "2">For example, the cluster Poisson parameter over vowel observation types might be λ = 9 (indicating 9 vowel letters on average for the cluster), while the parameter over consonant observation types might be λ = 20 (indicating 20 consonant letters on average).</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "3">These priors will be distinct In contrast, the transition Dirichlet parameters may be asymmetric, and thus very specific and informative.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "4">For example, one cluster may have the property that CCC consonant clusters are exceedingly rare across all its languages.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "5">This property would be expressed by a very small mean for each language cluster and serve to characterize ′ CCC ≪ 1 but large precision α0.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "6">Later we shall its general linguistic and typological properties.</S>

			<S sid ="67" ssid = "12">The Dirich let serves as the conjugate prior for the Multinomial, meaning that the posterior θ1 ...θk |X1 ...Xn is again distributed as a Dirichlet (with updated parameters).</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "13">It is instructive to reparameterize the Dirichlet with k + 1 parameters:see examples of learned transition Dirichlet pa rameters.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "14">3.3 Cluster Generation.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "15">The generation of the cluster parameters (Algorithm 1) defines the highest layer of priors for our model.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "16">As Dirichlets lack a standard conjugate prior, we simply use uniform priors over the interval [0, 500].</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "17">For the cluster Poisson parameters, we use conjugate Gamma distributions with vague priors.3</S>

			<S sid ="77" ssid = "5">In this one have observed character and tag sequences: parameterization, we have E[θi] = α′ . In other words, the parameters α′ give the mean of the distribution, and α0 gives the precision of the dis tribution.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "6">For large α0 ≫ k, the distribution is highly peaked around the mean (conversely, when α0 ≪ k, the mean lies in a valley).</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "7">Thus, the Dirichlet parameters of a language cluster characterize both the average HMMs of individual languages within the cluster, as well as how much we expect the HMMs to vary from the mean.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "8">In the case of emission distributions, we assume symmetric Dirichlet priors — i.e. one-parameter Dirichlets with densities given byf (θ1 ...θk |β) ∝ n θ(β−1).</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "9">This assumption is nec essary, as we have no way to identify characters across languages in the decipherment scenario, and even the number of consonants and vowels (and thus multinomial/Dirichlet dimensions) can vary across the languages of a cluster.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "10">Thus, the mean of these Dirichlets will always be a uniform emission distribution.</S>

For the target language, we observe only character token sequence w1, w2, . . .We assume fixed and known parameter val ues only at the cluster generation level.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "14">Unobserved variables include (i) the cluster parameters α, β, λ, (ii) the cluster assignments z, (iii) the per- language HMM parameters θ, φ for all languages, and (iv) for the target language, the tag tokens t1, t2, . . .</S>

			<S sid ="89" ssid = "17">Our goal in inference is to predict the most likely tag tw,ℓ for each character type w in our target language ℓ according to the posterior: f (tw,ℓ | w, t−ℓ) this mean is on a peak (large β) or in a valley(small β).</S>

			<S sid ="100" ssid = "28">4.2 Gibbs Sampling.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "29">To sample values (tℓ, z, α, β) from their posterior (the integrand of Equation 1), we use Gibbs sampling, a Monte Carlo technique that constructs a Markov chain over a high-dimensional sample space by iteratively sampling each variable conditioned on the currently drawn sample values for the others, starting from a random initialization.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "30">The Markov chain converges to an equilibrium distribution which is in fact the desired joint density (Geman and Geman, 1984).</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "31">We now sketch the sampling equations for each of our sampled variables.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "32">Sampling tw,ℓ To sample the tag assignment to character w in language ℓ, we need to compute: f (tw,ℓ | w, t−w,ℓ, t−ℓ, z, α, β) (3) ∝ f (wℓ, tℓ, Nℓ | αk , βk , Nk−ℓ) (4) where Nℓ are the types-per-tag counts implied by the mapping tℓ, k is the current cluster assignment for the target language (zℓ = k), αk and βk are the cluster parameters, and Nk−ℓ are the types-per-tag counts for all languages currently assigned to the cluster, other than language ℓ.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "33">Applying the chain rule along with our model’s conditional independence structure, we can further where n(t) and n(t, t′) are, respectively, unigram and bigram tag counts excluding those containing character w. Conversely, n′(t) and n′(t, t′) are, respectively, unigram and bigram tag counts only including those containing character w. The notation a[n] denotes the ascending factorial: a(a + 1) · · · (a + n −1).</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "34">Finally, we tackle the third term,Equation 7, corresponding to the predictive dis tribution of emission observations given Dirichlet hyperparameters.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "35">Again, removing constant terms gives us: [n(w)] k,t n [n(t′ )] t′ ℓ,t′ k,t′ where n(w) is the unigram count of character w, and n(t′) is the unigram count of tag t, over all characters tokens (including w).</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "36">Sampling αk,t,t′ To sample the Dirichlet hyperparameter for cluster k and transition t → t′, we need to compute: f (αk,t,t′ |t, z) ∝ f (t, z|αz,t,t′ ) = f (tk |αz,t,t′ ) where tk are the tag sequences for all languages currently assigned to cluster k. This term is a predictive distribution of the multinomialDirichlet compound when the observations are grouped into multiple multinomials all with the same prior.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "37">Rather than inefficiently computing a product of Polya urn schemes (with many repeated ascending factorials with the same base), we group common terms together and calculate: nj=1(αk,t,t′ + k)n(j,k,t,t )n &apos;L The three terms correspond to (1) a standard predictive distributions for the Poisson-gamma compound and (2) the standard predictive distributions for the transition and emission multinomial j=1( t′′ αk,t,t′′ + k)n(j,k,t) Dirichlet compounds.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "38">where n(j, k, t) and n(j, k, t, t′) are the numbers of languages currently assigned to cluster k which have more than j occurrences of unigram (t) and bigram (t, t′), respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "39">This gives us an efficient way to compute un- normalized posterior densities for α.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "40">However, we need to sample from these distributions, not just compute them.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "41">To do so, we turn to slice sampling (Neal, 2003), a simple yet effective auxiliary variable scheme for sampling values from unnormalized but otherwise computable densities.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "42">The key idea is to supplement the variable x, distributed according to unnormalized density p˜(x), with a second variable u with joint density</S>

			<S sid ="124" ssid = "10">Sampling βk,t To sample the Dirichlet hyperparameter for cluster k and tag t we need to compute: f (βk,t|t, w, z, N) ∝ f (w|t, z, βk,t, N) ∝ f (wk |tk , βk,t, Nk ) where, as before, tk are the tag sequences for languages assigned to cluster k, Nk are the tag observation type-counts for languages assigned to the cluster, and likewise wk are the character sequences of all languages in the cluster.</S>

			<S sid ="195" ssid = "34">Examining just the first row, we see that the languages are partially grouped by their preference for the initial tag of words.</S>
			<S sid ="196" ssid = "35">All clusters favor languages which prefer initial consonants, though this preference is most weakly expressed in cluster 3.</S>
			<S sid ="197" ssid = "36">In contrast, both clusters 2 and 4 have very dominant tendencies towards consonant-initial languages, but differ in the relative weight given to languages preferring either vowels or nasals initially.</S>
			<S sid ="198" ssid = "37">Finally, we examine the relationship between the induced clusters and language families in Table 3, for the trigram consonant vs. vowel CLUST model with 20 clusters.</S>
			<S sid ="199" ssid = "38">We see that for about half the clusters, there is a majority language family, most often NigerCongo.</S>
			<S sid ="200" ssid = "39">We also observe distinctive clusters devoted to Austronesian and Quechuan languages.</S>

			<S sid ="203" ssid = "42">In this paper, we presented a successful solution to one aspect of the decipherment task: the prediction of consonants and vowels for an unknown language and alphabet.</S>
			<S sid ="204" ssid = "43">Adopting a classical Bayesian perspective, we develop a model that performs posterior inference over hundreds of languages, leveraging knowledge of known languages to uncover general linguistic patterns of typologically coherent language clusters.</S>
			<S sid ="205" ssid = "44">Using this model, we automatically distinguish between consonant and vowel characters with nearly 99% accuracy across 503 languages.</S>
			<S sid ="206" ssid = "45">We further experimented on a three-way classification task involving nasal characters, achieving nearly 90% accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="207" ssid = "46">Future work will take us in several new directions: first, we would like to move beyond the assumption of an alphabetic writing system so that we can apply our method to undeciphered syllabic scripts such as Linear A. We would also like to extend our methods to achieve finer-grained resolution of phonetic properties beyond nasals, consonants, and vowels.</S>
