			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Part-of-speech categories are elementary building blocks that play an important role in many natural language processing tasks, from machine translation to information extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Supervised learning of taggers from POS-annotated training text is a well-studied task, with several methods achieving near-human tagging accuracy (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Toutanova et al., 2003; Shen et al., 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">However, while English and a handful of other languages are fortunate enough to have comprehensive POS- annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), most of the world’s languages have no labeled corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">The annotated corpora that do exist were costly to build (Abeille´, 2003), and are often not freely available or restricted to research- only use.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Furthermore, much of the annotated text is of limited genre, normally focusing on newswire or literary text.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Performance of treebank-trained systems degrades significantly when applied to new domains (Blitzer et al., 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Unsupervised induction of POS taggers offers the possibility of avoiding costly annotation, but despite recent progress, the accuracy of unsupervised POS taggers still falls far behind supervised systems, and is not suitable for most applications (Berg- Kirkpatrick et al., 2010; Grac¸a et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Using additional information, in the form of tag dictionaries or parallel text, seems unavoidable at present.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Early work on using tag dictionaries used a labeled corpus to extract all allowed word-tag pairs (Merialdo, 1994), which is quite an unrealistic scenario.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">More recent work has used a subset of the observed word-tag pairs and focused on generalizing dictionary entries (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Toutanova and Johnson, 2007; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Using corpus- based dictionaries greatly biases the test results, and gives little information about the capacity to generalize to different domains.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Recent work by Das and Petrov (2011) builds a dictionary for a particular language by transferring annotated data from a resource-rich language through the use of word alignments in parallel text.</S>

			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Qc 2012 Association for Computational Linguistics The main idea is to rely on existing dictionaries for some languages (e.g. English) and use parallel data to build a dictionary in the desired language and extend the dictionary coverage using label propagation.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">However, parallel text does not exist for many pairs of languages and the proposed bilingual projection algorithms are fairly complex.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">In this work we use the Wiktionary, a freely available, high coverage and constantly growing dictionary for a large number of languages.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">We experiment with a very simple second-order Hidden Markov Model with feature-based emissions (Berg- Kirkpatrick et al., 2010; Grac¸a et al., 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">We outperform best current results using parallel text supervision across 8 different languages, even when the word type coverage is as low as 20%.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Furthermore, using the Brown corpus as out-of-domain data we show that using the Wiktionary produces better taggers than using the Penn Treebank dictionary (88.5% vs 85.9%).</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Our empirical analysis and the natural growth rate of the Wiktionary suggest that free, high-quality and multi-domain POStaggers for a large number of languages can be obtained by standard and efficient models.</S>

			<S sid ="28" ssid = "1">The scarcity of labeled corpora for resource poor languages and the challenges of domain adaptation have led to several efforts to build systems for unsupervised POStagging.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "2">Several lines of research have addressed the fully unsupervised POS-tagging task: mutual information clustering (Brown et al., 1992; Clark, 2003) has been used to group words according to their distributional context.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "3">Using dimensionality reduction on word contexts followed by clustering has led to accuracy gains (Schu¨ tze, 1995; Lamar et al., 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "4">Sequence models, HMMs in particular, have been used to represent the probabilistic dependencies between consecutive tags.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "5">In these approaches, each observation corresponds to a particular word and each hidden state corresponds to a cluster.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "6">However, using maximum likelihood training for such models does not achieve good results (Clark, 2003): maximum likelihood training tends to result in very ambiguous distributions for common words, in contradiction with the rather sparse word-tag distribution.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "7">Several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this problem, including Bayesian approaches using an improper Dirichlet prior to favor sparse model parameters (Johnson, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007), or using the Posterior Regularization to penalize ambiguous posteriors distributions of tags given tokens (Grac¸a et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "8">Berg-Kirkpatrick et al.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "9">(2010) and Grac¸a et al.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "10">(2011) proposed replacing the multinomial emission distributions of standard HMMs by maximum entropy (ME) feature-based distributions.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "11">This allows the use of features to capture morphological information, and achieves very promising results.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "12">Despite these improvements, fully unsupervised systems require an oracle to map clusters to true tags and the performance still fails to be of practical use.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "13">In this paper we follow a different line of work where we rely on a prior tag dictionary indicating for each word type what POS tags it can take on (Merialdo, 1994).</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "14">The task is then, for each word token in the corpus, to disambiguate between the possible POS tags.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "15">Even when using a tag dictionary, disambiguating from all possible tags is still a hard problem and the accuracy of these methods is still fall far behind their supervised counterparts.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "16">The scarcity of large, manually-constructed tag dictionaries led to the development of methods that try to generalize from a small dictionary with only a handful of entries (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Toutanova and Johnson, 2007; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007), however most previous works build the dictionary from the labeled corpus they learn on, which does not represent a realistic dictionary.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "17">In this paper, we argue that the Wiktionary can serve as an effective and much less biased tag dictionary.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "18">We note that most of the previous dictionary based approaches can be applied using the Wiktionary and would likely lead to similar accuracy increases that we show in this paper.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "19">For example, the work if Ravi and Knight (2009) minimizes the number of possible tag-tag transitions in the HMM via a integer program, hence discarding unlikely transitions that would confuse the model.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "20">Models can also be trained jointly using parallel corpora in sev eral languages, exploiting the fact that different languages present different ambiguities (Snyder et al., 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "21">The Wiktionary has been used extensively for other tasks such as domain specific information retrieval (Mu¨ ller and Gurevych, 2009), ontology matching (Krizhanovsky and Lin, 2009), synonymy detection (Navarro et al., 2009), sentiment classification (Chesley et al., 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "22">Recently, Ding (2011) used the Wiktionary to initialize an HMM for Chinese POS tagging combined with label propagation.</S>

	<SECTION title="The Wiktionary and tagged corpora. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "1">The Wiktionary1 is a collaborative project that aims to produce a free, large-scale multilingual dictionary.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "2">Its goal is to describe all words from all languages (currently more than 400) using definitions and descriptions in English.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "3">The coverage of the Wiktionary varies greatly between languages: currently there are around 75 languages for which there exists more than 1000 word types, and 27 for which there exists more than 10,000 word types.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "4">Nevertheless, the Wiktionary has been growing at a considerable rate (see Figure 1), and the number of available words has almost doubled in the last three years.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "5">As more people use the Wiktionary, it is likely to grow.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "6">Unlike tagged corpora, the Wiktionary provides natural incentives for users to contribute missing entries and expand this communal resource akin to Wikipedia.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "7">As with Wikipedia, the questions of accuracy, bias, consistency across languages, and selective coverage are paramount.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "8">In this section, we explore these concerns by comparing Wiktionary to dictionaries derived from tagged corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "9">3.1 Labeled corpora and Universal tags.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "10">We collected part-of-speech tagged corpora for 9 languages, from CoNLL-X and CoNLL2007 shared tasks on dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "11">In this work we use the Universal POS tag set (Petrov et al., 2011) that defines 12 universal categories with a relatively stable functional definition across languages.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "12">These categories include NOUN, VERB, ADJ = adjective, ADV = adverb, NUM = number, ADP = adposition, CONJ = conjunction, DET = determiner, PRON = 1 http://www.wiktionary.org/ Figure 1: Growth of the Wiktionary over the last three years, showing total number of entries for all languages and for the 9 languages we consider (left axis).</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "13">We also show the corresponding increase in average accuracy (right axis) achieved by our model across the 9 languages (see details below).</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "14">pronoun, PUNC = punctuation, PRT = particle, and X = residual (a category for language-specific categories which defy cross-linguistic classification).</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "15">We found several small problems with the mapping2 which we corrected as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "16">In Spanish, the fine- level tag for date (“w”) is mapped to universal tag NUM, while it should be mapped to NOUN.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "17">In Danish there were no PRT, NUM, PUNC, or DET tags in the mapping.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "18">After examining the corpus guidelines and the mapping more closely, we found that the tag AC (Cardinal numeral) and AO (Ordinal numeral) are mapped to ADJ.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "19">Although the corpus guidelines indicate the category SsCatgram ‘adjective’ that encompasses both ‘normal’ adjectives (AN) as well as cardinal numeral (AC) and ordinal numerals (AO), we decided to tag AC and AO as NUM, since this assignment better fits the existing mapping.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "20">We also reassigned all punctuation marks, which were erroneously mapped to X, to PUNC and the tag U which is used for words at, de and som, to PRT.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "21">3.2 Wiktionary to Universal tags.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "22">There are a total of 330 distinct POS-type tags in Wiktionary across all languages which we have mapped to the Universal tagset.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "23">Most of the mapping was straightforward since the tags used in the Wiktionary are in fact close to the Universal tag set.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "24">Some exceptions like “Initialism”, “Suffix” 2 http://code.google.com/p/ universal-pos-tags/ were discarded.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "25">We also mapped relatively rare tags such as “Interjection”, “Symbol” to the “X” tag.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "26">A example of POS tags for several words in the Wiktionary is shown in Table 1.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "27">All the mappings are available at http://code.google.com/ p/wikily-supervised-postagger/.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "28">3.3 Wiktionary coverage.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "29">There are two kinds of coverage of interest: type coverage and token coverage.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "30">We define type coverage as the proportion of word types in the corpus that simply appear in the Wiktionary (accuracy of the tag sets are considered in the next subsection).</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "31">Token coverage is defined similarly as the portion of all word tokens in the corpus that appear in the Wiktionary.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "32">These statistics reflect two aspects of the usefulness of a dictionary that affect learning in different ways: token coverage increases the density of supervised signal while type coverage increases the diversity of word shape supervision.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "33">At one extreme, with 100% word and token coverage, we recover the POS tag disambiguation scenario and, on the other extreme of 0% coverage, we recover the unsupervised POS induction scenario.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "34">The type and token coverage of Wiktionary for each of the languages we are using for evaluation is shown in Figure 2.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "35">We plot the coverage bar for three different versions of Wiktionary (v20100326, v20110321, v20120320), arranged chronologically.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "36">We chose these three versions of the Wiktionary simply by date, not any other factors like coverage, quality or tagging accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "37">As expected, the newer versions of the Wiktionary generally have larger coverage both on type level and token level.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "38">Nevertheless, even for languages whose type coverage is relatively low, such as Greek (el), the token level coverage is still quite good (more than half of the tokens are covered).</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "39">The reason for this is likely the bias of the contributors towards more frequent words.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "40">This trend is even more evident when we break up the coverage by frequency of the words.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "41">Since the number of words varies from corpus to corpus, we normalize the word counts by the count of the most frequent word(s) in its corpus and group the normalized frequency into three categories labeled as “low”, “medium” and “high” and for each category, we calculate the word type coverage, shown in Figure 3.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "42">Figure 2: Type-level (top) and token-level (bottom) coverage for the nine languages in three versions of the Wiktionary.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "43">We also compared the coverage provided by the Wiktionary versus the Penn Treebank (PTB) extracted dictionary on the Brown corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "44">Figure 4 shows that the Wiktionary provides a greater coverage for all sections of the Brown corpus, hence being a better dictionary for tagging English text in general.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "45">This is also reflected in the gain in accuracy on Brown over the taggers learned from the PTB dictionary in our experiments.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "46">3.4 Wiktionary.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "47">accuracy A more refined notion of quality is the accuracy of the tag sets for covered words, as measured against dictionaries extracted from labeled tree bank corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "48">We consider word types that are in both the Wiktionary (W) and the tree bank dictionaries (T).</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "49">For each word type, we compare the two tag sets and distinguish five different possibilities: 1.</S>

			<S sid ="144" ssid = "13">Finally, we also compare our system against a strong set of baselines that use bilingual data.</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "14">These approaches build a dictionary by transferring labeled data from a resource rich language (English) to a resource poor language (Das and Petrov, 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "15">We compare against two such methods.</S>
			<S sid ="147" ssid = "16">The first, projection, builds a dictionary by transferring the pos 3 Values for these systems where taken from the D&amp;P paper..</S>
			<S sid ="148" ssid = "17">tags from English to the new language using word alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="149" ssid = "18">The second method, D&amp;P, is the current state-of-the-art system, and runs label propagation on the dictionary resulting from the projected method.</S>
			<S sid ="150" ssid = "19">We note that both of these approaches are orthogonal to ours and could be used simultaneously with the Wiktionary.</S>
			<S sid ="151" ssid = "20">5.3 Analysis.</S>
			<S sid ="152" ssid = "21">Table 2 shows results for the different models across languages.</S>
			<S sid ="153" ssid = "22">We note that the results are not directly comparable since both the Unsupervised and the Bilingual results use a different setup, using the number of fine grained tags for each language as hidden states instead of 12 (as we do).</S>
			<S sid ="154" ssid = "23">This greatly increases the degrees of freedom of the model allowing it to capture more fine grained distinctions.</S>
			<S sid ="155" ssid = "24">The first two observations are that using the ME entropy emission model always improves over the standard multinomial model, and using a second order model always performs better.</S>
			<S sid ="156" ssid = "25">Comparing with the work of D&amp;P, we see that our model achieves better accuracy on average and on 5 out of 8 languages.</S>
			<S sid ="157" ssid = "26">The most common errors are due to tag set idiosyncrasies.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "27">For instance, for English the symbol % is tagged as NUM by our system while in the Penn treebank it is tagged as Noun.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "28">Other common mistakes for English include tagging to as an adposition (preposition) instead of particle and tagging which as a pronoun instead of determiner.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "29">In the next subsections we analyze the errors in more detail.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "30">Finally, for English we also trained the SHMM- ME model using the Celex2 dictionary available from LDC4.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "31">Celex2 coverage for the PTB corpus is much smaller than the coverage provided by the Wiktionary (43.8% type coverage versus 80.0%).</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "32">Correspondingly, the accuracy of the model trained using Celex2 is 75.5% compared 87.1% when trained using the Wiktionary.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "33">5.4 Performance vs. Wiktionary ambiguity.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "34">While many words overwhelmingly appear with one tag in a given genre, in the Wiktionary a large proportion of words are annotated with several tags, even when those are extremely rare events.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "35">Around 4 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/ catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC96L14 35% of word types in English have more than one tag according to the Wiktionary.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "36">This increases the difficulty of predicting the correct tag as compared to having a corpus-based dictionary, where words have a smaller level of ambiguity.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "37">For example, in English, for words with one tag, the accuracy is 95% (the reason it is not 100% is due to a discrepancy between the Wiktionary and the tree bank.)</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "38">For words with two possible tags, accuracy is 81% and for three tags, it drops to 63%.</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "39">5.5 Generalization to unknown words.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "40">Comparing the performance of the proposed model for words in the Wiktionary against words not in the Wiktionary, we see an average drop from 89% to 63% for out-of-vocabulary words across nine languages.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "41">Table 2 shows that the average loss of accuracy between All TBD and Covered TBD of 4.5% (which is due purely to decrease in coverage) is larger than the loss between Covered TBD and the best Wiktionary model, of 3.2% (which is due to tag set inconsistency).</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "42">One advantage of the Wiktionary is that it is a general purpose dictionary and not tailored for a particular domain.</S>
			<S sid ="174" ssid = "43">To illustrate this we compared several models on the Brown corpus: the SHMM-ME model using the Wiktionary (Wik), against using a model trained using a dictionary extracted from the PTB corpus (PTBD), or trained fully supervised using the PTB corpus (PTB).</S>
			<S sid ="175" ssid = "44">We tested all these models on the 15 different sections of the Brown corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "45">We also compare against a state-of-the-art POStagger tagger (ST)5.</S>
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "46">Figure 6 shows the accuracy results for each model on the different sections.</S>
			<S sid ="178" ssid = "47">The fully supervised SHMM-ME model did not perform as well as the the Stanford tagger (about 3% behind on average), most likely because of generative vs. discriminate training of the two models and feature differences.</S>
			<S sid ="179" ssid = "48">However, quite surprisingly, the Wiktionary- tag-set-trained model performs much better not only than the PTB-tag-set-trained model but also the supervised model on the Brown corpus.</S>

			<S sid ="201" ssid = "1">We have shown that the Wiktionary can be used to train a very simple model to achieve state-of- art weakly-supervised and out-of-domain POS tag- gers.</S>
			<S sid ="202" ssid = "2">The methods outlined in the paper are standard and easy to replicate, yet highly accurate and should serve as baselines for more complex propos als.</S>
			<S sid ="203" ssid = "3">These encouraging results show that using free, collaborative NLP resources can in fact produce results of the same level or better than using expensive annotations for many languages.</S>
			<S sid ="204" ssid = "4">Furthermore, the Wiktionary contains other possibly useful information, such as glosses and translations.</S>
			<S sid ="205" ssid = "5">It would be very interesting and perhaps necessary to incorporate this additional data in order to tackle challenges that arise across a larger number of language types, specifically non-European languages.</S>
