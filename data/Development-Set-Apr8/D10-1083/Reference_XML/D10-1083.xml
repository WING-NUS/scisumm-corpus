			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Since the early days of statistical NLP, researchers have observed that a part-of-speech tag distribution exhibits “one tag per discourse” sparsity — words are likely to select a single predominant tag in a corpus, even when several tags are possible.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Simply assigning to each word its most frequent associated tag in a corpus achieves 94.6% accuracy on the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">This distributional sparsity of syntactic tags is not unique to English 1 The source code for the work presented in this paper is available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rbg/code/typetagging/.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">— similar results have been observed across multiple languages.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Clearly, explicitly modeling such a powerful constraint on tagging assignment has a potential to significantly improve the accuracy of an unsupervised part-of-speech tagger learned without a tagging dictionary.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">In practice, this sparsity constraint is difficult to incorporate in a traditional POS induction system (Me´rialdo, 1994; Johnson, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008; Grac¸a et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">These sequence models-based approaches commonly treat token-level tag assignment as the primary latent variable.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">By design, they readily capture regularities at the token-level.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">However, these approaches are ill-equipped to directly represent type-based constraints such as sparsity.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Previous work has attempted to incorporate such constraints into token-level models via heavy-handed modifications to inference procedure and objective function (e.g., posterior regularization and ILP decoding) (Grac¸a et al., 2009; Ravi and Knight, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">In most cases, however, these expansions come with a steep increase in model complexity, with respect to training procedure and inference time.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">In this work, we take a more direct approach and treat a word type and its allowed POS tags as a primary element of the model.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">The model starts by generating a tag assignment for each word type in a vocabulary, assuming one tag per word.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Then, token- level HMM emission parameters are drawn conditioned on these assignments such that each word is only allowed probability mass on a single assigned tag.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">In this way we restrict the parameterization of a Language Original case English Danish Dutch German Spanish Swedish Portuguese 94.6 96.3 96.6 95.5 95.4 93.3 95.6 Table 1: Upper bound on tagging accuracy assuming each word type is assigned to majority POS tag.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">Across all languages, high performance can be attained by selecting a single tag per word type.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">token-level HMM to reflect lexicon sparsity.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">This model admits a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm where the number of latent variables is proportional to the number of word types, rather than the size of a corpus as for a standard HMM sampler (Johnson, 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">There are two key benefits of this model architecture.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">First, it directly encodes linguistic intuitions about POS tag assignments: the model structure reflects the one-tag-per-word property, and a type- level tag prior captures the skew on tag assignments (e.g., there are fewer unique determiners than unique nouns).</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">Second, the reduced number of hidden variables and parameters dramatically speeds up learning and inference.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">We evaluate our model on seven languages exhibiting substantial syntactic variation.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">On several languages, we report performance exceeding that of state-of-the art systems.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">Our analysis identifies three key factors driving our performance gain: 1) selecting a model structure which directly encodes tag sparsity, 2) a type-level prior on tag assignments, and 3) a straightforward na¨ıveBayes approach to incorporate features.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">The observed performance gains, coupled with the simplicity of model implementation, makes it a compelling alternative to existing more complex counterparts.</S>

	<SECTION title="Related Work. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "1">Recent work has made significant progress on unsupervised POS tagging (Me´rialdo, 1994; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Johnson,2007; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Gao and John son, 2008; Ravi and Knight, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "2">Our work is closely related to recent approaches that incorporate the sparsity constraint into the POS induction process.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "3">This line of work has been motivated by empirical findings that the standard EM-learned unsupervised HMM does not exhibit sufficient word tag sparsity.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "4">The extent to which this constraint is enforced varies greatly across existing methods.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "5">On one end of the spectrum are clustering approaches that assign a single POS tag to each word type (Schutze, 1995; Lamar et al., 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "6">These clusters are computed using an SVD variant without relying on transitional structure.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "7">While our method also enforces a singe tag per word constraint, it leverages the transition distribution encoded in an HMM, thereby benefiting from a richer representation of context.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "8">Other approaches encode sparsity as a soft constraint.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "9">For instance, by altering the emission distribution parameters, Johnson (2007) encourages the model to put most of the probability mass on few tags.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "10">This design does not guarantee “structural zeros,” but biases towards sparsity.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "11">A more forceful approach for encoding sparsity is posterior regularization, which constrains the posterior to have a small number of expected tag assignments (Grac¸a et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "12">This approach makes the training objective more complex by adding linear constraints proportional to the number of word types, which is rather prohibitive.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "13">A more rigid mechanism for modeling sparsity is proposed by Ravi and Knight (2009), who minimize the size of tagging grammar as measured by the number of transition types.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "14">The use of ILP in learning the desired grammar significantly increases the computational complexity of this method.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "15">In contrast to these approaches, our method directly incorporates these constraints into the structure of the model.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "16">This design leads to a significant reduction in the computational complexity of training and inference.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "17">Another thread of relevant research has explored the use of features in unsupervised POS induction (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010; Hasan and Ng, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "18">These methods demonstrated the benefits of incorporating linguistic features using a log-linear parameterization, but requires elaborate machinery for training.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "19">In our work, we demonstrate that using a simple na¨ıveBayes approach also yields substantial performance gains, without the associated training complexity.</S>

			<S sid ="52" ssid = "1">We consider the unsupervised POS induction problem without the use of a tagging dictionary.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "2">A graphical depiction of our model as well as a summary of random variables and parameters can be found in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "3">As is standard, we use a fixed constant K for the number of tagging states.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "4">Model Overview The model starts by generating a tag assignment T for each word type in a vocabulary, assuming one tag per word.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "5">Conditioned on T , features of word types W are drawn.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "6">We refer to (T , W ) as the lexicon of a language and ψ for the parameters for their generation; ψ depends on a single hyperparameter β.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "7">Once the lexicon has been drawn, the model proceeds similarly to the standard token-level HMM: Emission parameters θ are generated conditioned on tag assignments T . We also draw transition parameters φ.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "8">Both parameters depend on a single hyperparameter α.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "9">Once HMM parameters (θ, φ) are drawn, a token-level tag and word sequence, (t, w), is generated in the standard HMM fashion: a tag sequence t is generated from φ.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "10">The corresponding token words w are drawn conditioned on t and θ.2 Our full generative model is given by: K P (φ, θ|T , α, β) = n (P (φt|α)P (θt|T , α)) t=1 The transition distribution φt for each tag t is drawn according to DIRICHLET(α, K ), where α is the shared transition and emission distribution hyperparameter.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "11">In total there are O(K 2) parameters associated with the transition parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "12">In contrast to the Bayesian HMM, θt is not drawn from a distribution which has support for each of the n word types.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "13">Instead, we condition on the type-level tag assignments T . Specifically, let St = {i|Ti = t} denote the indices of theword types which have been assigned tag t accord ing to the tag assignments T . Then θt is drawn from DIRICHLET(α, St), a symmetric Dirichlet which only places mass on word types indicated by St. This ensures that each word will only be assigned a single tag at inference time (see Section 4).</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "14">Note that while the standard HMM, has O(K n) emission parameters, our model has O(n) effective parameters.3 Token Component Once HMM parameters (φ, θ) have been drawn, the HMM generates a token-level corpus w in the standard way: P (w, t|φ, θ) = P (T , W , θ, ψ, φ, t, w|α, β) = P (T , W , ψ|β) [Lexicon]  n n  (w,t)∈(w,t) j  P (tj |φtj−1 )P (wj |tj , θtj ) P (φ, θ|T , α, β) [Parameter] P (w, t|φ, θ) [Token] We refer to the components on the right hand side as the lexicon, parameter, and token component respectively.</S>

			<S sid ="67" ssid = "16">Parameter Component As in the standard Bayesian HMM (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007), all distributions are independently drawn from symmetric Dirichlet distributions: 2 Note that t and w denote tag and word sequences respectively, rather than individual tokens or tags.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "17">Note that in our model, conditioned on T , there is precisely one t which has nonzero probability for the token component, since for each word, exactly one θt has support.</S>

			<S sid ="80" ssid = "29">to explore how well we can induce POS tags using only the one-tag-per-word constraint.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "30">Specifically, the lexicon is generated as: P (T , W |ψ) =P (T )P (W |T ) Word Type Features (FEATS): Past unsupervised POS work have derived benefits from features on word types, such as suffix and capitalization features (Hasan and Ng, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al.,2010).</S>

			<S sid ="83" ssid = "32">In our model, we associate these features at the type-level in the lexicon.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "33">Here, we conThis model is equivalent to the standard HMM ex cept that it enforces the one-word-per-tag constraint.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "34">Learned Tag Prior (PRIOR) We next assume there exists a single prior distribution ψ over tag assignments drawn from DIRICHLET(β, K ).</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "35">This alters generation of T as follows: n P (T |ψ) = n P (Ti|ψ) i=1 Note that this distribution captures the frequency of a tag across word types, as opposed to tokens.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "36">The P (T |ψ) distribution, in English for instance, should have very low mass for the DT (determiner) tag, since determiners are a very small portion of the vocabulary.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "37">In contrast, NNP (proper nouns) form a large portion of vocabulary.</S>

			<S sid ="91" ssid = "40">(2010), we adopt a simpler na¨ıve Bayes strategy, where all features are emitted independently.</S>

			<S sid ="170" ssid = "31">Specifically, we (+FEATS) utilizes the tag prior as well as features (e.g., suffixes and orthographic features), discussed in Section 3, for the P (W |T , ψ) component.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "32">Hyperparameters Our model has two Dirichlet concentration hyperparameters: α is the shared hyperparameter for the token-level HMM emission and transition distributions.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "33">β is the shared hyperparameter for the tag assignment prior and word feature multinomials.</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "34">We experiment with four values for each hyperparameter resulting in 16 (α, β) combinations: α β 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10 Iterations In each run, we performed 30 iterations of Gibbs sampling for the type assignment variables W .4 We use the final sample for evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="174" ssid = "35">Evaluation Metrics We report three metrics to evaluate tagging performance.</S>
			<S sid ="175" ssid = "36">As is standard, we report the greedy one-to-one (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) and the many-to-one token-level accuracy obtained from mapping model states to gold POS tags.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "37">We also report word type level accuracy, the fraction of word types assigned their majority tag (where the mapping between model state and tag is determined by greedy one-to-one mapping discussed above).5 For each language, we aggregate results in the following way: First, for each hyperparameter setting, evaluate three variants: The first model (1TW) only 4 Typically, the performance stabilizes after only 10 itera-.</S>

			<S sid ="184" ssid = "45">Specifically, for both settings we report results on the median run for each setting.</S>
			<S sid ="185" ssid = "46">Tag set As is standard, for all experiments, we set the number of latent model tag states to the size of the annotated tag set.</S>
			<S sid ="186" ssid = "47">The original tag set for the CoNLL-X Dutch data set consists of compounded tags that are used to tag multi-word units (MWUs) resulting in a tag set of over 300 tags.</S>
			<S sid ="187" ssid = "48">We tokenize MWUs and their POS tags; this reduces the tag set size to 12.</S>
			<S sid ="188" ssid = "49">See Table 2 for the tag set size of other languages.</S>

			<S sid ="236" ssid = "97">We have presented a method for unsupervised part- of-speech tagging that considers a word type and its allowed POS tags as a primary element of the model.</S>
			<S sid ="237" ssid = "98">This departure from the traditional token-based tagging approach allows us to explicitly capture type- level distributional properties of valid POS tag as signments as part of the model.</S>
			<S sid ="238" ssid = "99">The resulting model is compact, efficiently learnable and linguistically expressive.</S>
			<S sid ="239" ssid = "100">Our empirical results demonstrate that the type-based tagger rivals state-of-the-art tag-level taggers which employ more sophisticated learning mechanisms to exploit similar constraints.</S>
			<S sid ="240" ssid = "101">In this paper, we make a simplifying assumption of one-tag-per-word.</S>
			<S sid ="241" ssid = "102">This assumption, however, is not inherent to type-based tagging models.</S>
			<S sid ="242" ssid = "103">A promising direction for future work is to explicitly model a distribution over tags for each word type.</S>
			<S sid ="243" ssid = "104">We hypothesize that modeling morphological information will greatly constrain the set of possible tags, thereby further refining the representation of the tag lexicon.</S>
