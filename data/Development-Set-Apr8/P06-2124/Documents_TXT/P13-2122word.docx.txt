Abstract

We  describe a translation  model adapta- 
tion approach for conversational  spoken 
language translation  (CSLT), which en- 
courages the use of contextually appropri- 
ate translation options from relevant train- 
ing conversations. Our approach employs 
a monolingual   LDA topic model to de- 
rive a similarity measure between the test 
conversation  and the set of training con- 
versations,  which is used  to bias trans- 
lation choices  towards  the current con- 
text.  A significant novelty of our adap- 
tation technique is its incremental nature; 
we continuously update the topic distribu- 
tion on the evolving  test conversation  as 
new utterances become available.   Thus, 
our approach is well-suited to the causal 
constraint of spoken  conversations. On 
an English-to-Iraqi CSLT task, the pro- 
posed approach gives significant improve- 
ments over a baseline system as measured 
by BLEU, TER, and NIST. Interestingly, 
the incremental  approach  outperforms  a 
non-incremental  oracle that has up-front 
knowledge of the whole conversation.

1   Introduction

Conversational spoken  language  translation 
(CSLT) systems  facilitate communication be- 
tween subjects who  do  not  speak the same 
language.   Current  systems are typically used to 
achieve  a specific  task (e.g. vehicle checkpoint 
search, medical diagnosis, etc.). These task-driven

Distribution Statement  A  (Approved for Public Release, 
Distribution Unlimited)


conversations  typically revolve  around  a set of 
central topics, which may not be evident at the 
beginning of the interaction.  As the conversation 
progresses, however, the gradual accumulation  of 
contextual information  can be used to infer the 
topic(s) of discussion, and to deploy contextually 
appropriate translation phrase pairs. For example, 
the word ‘drugs’  will  predominantly   translate 
into Spanish  as ‘medicamentos’ (medicines) in a 
medical scenario, whereas the translation ‘drogas’ 
(illegal drugs) will predominate in a law enforce- 
ment scenario.  Most CSLT systems do not take 
high-level global context into account, and instead 
translate  each utterance  in isolation. This often 
results in contextually inappropriate translations, 
and is particularly problematic in conversational 
speech, which usually exhibits short, spontaneous, 
and often ambiguous utterances.


  In this paper, we describe  a novel topic-based 
adaptation technique for phrase-based statistical 
machine translation (SMT) of spoken conversa- 
tions.  We begin by building a monolingual   la- 
tent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model on the 
training conversations  (each conversation  corre- 
sponds to a “document”  in the LDA paradigm). 
At run-time, this model is used to infer a topic 
distribution  over the evolving test conversation up 
to and including  the current utterance. Transla- 
tion phrase pairs that originate in training conver- 
sations whose topic distribution is similar to that 
of the current  conversation  are given preference 
through  a single similarity feature,  which aug- 
ments the standard phrase-based SMT log-linear 
model. The topic distribution for the test conver- 
sation is updated incrementally  for each new utter- 
ance as the available history  grows.  With this ap- 
proach, we demonstrate significant improvements 
over a baseline phrase-based SMT  system as mea- 
sured  by BLEU,  TER  and NIST scores  on an 
English-to-Iraqi CSLT task.

2   Relation to Prior Work



Domain adaptation to improve SMT performance 
has attracted considerable attention in recent years 
(Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Finch and Sumita, 2008; 
Matsoukas et al., 2009). The general theme is to 
divide the training data into partitions representing 
different  domains, and to prefer translation options 
for a test sentence from training domains that most 
resemble the current document context. Weak- 
nesses of this approach include (a) assuming the 
existence of discrete, non-overlapping domains; 
and (b) the unreliability of models generated by 
segments with little training data.

  To avoid the need for hard decisions about do- 
main membership,  some have used topic modeling 
to improve SMT performance,  e.g., using latent 
semantic analysis (Tam et al., 2007) or ‘biTAM’ 
(Zhao and Xing, 2006). In contrast to our source 
language approach, these authors use both source 
and target information.

  Perhaps  most relevant  are the approaches  of 
Gong et al. (2010) and Eidelman et al. (2012), 
who both describe adaptation techniques where 
monolingual LDA topic models  are used to ob- 
tain a topic distribution  over the training data, fol- 
lowed by dynamic adaptation of the phrase table 
based on the inferred topic of the test document. 
While our proposed approach also employs mono- 
lingual LDA topic models, it deviates from the 
above methods in the following important ways. 
First, the existing  approaches are geared towards 
batch-mode text translation,  and assume that the 
full document context of a test sentence is always 
available.  This assumption is incompatible with 
translation of spoken conversations, which are in- 
herently causal. Our proposed approach infers 
topic distributions  incrementally  as the conversa- 
tion progresses.   Thus, it is not only consistent 
with the causal requirement,  but is also capable 
of tracking  topical  changes during the course of a 
conversation.

  Second, we do not directly augment the trans- 
lation table with the inferred topic distribution. 
Rather, we compute  a similarity between the cur- 
rent conversation history  and each of the training 
conversations, and use this measure to dynami- 
cally score the relevance of candidate translation 
phrase pairs during decoding.


3   Corpus Data and Baseline SMT

We use the DARPA  TransTac English-Iraqi par- 
allel two-way spoken dialogue collection to train 
both translation and LDA topic models. This data 
set contains a variety  of scenarios, including  med- 
ical diagnosis; force protection (e.g. checkpoint, 
reconnaissance, patrol);  aid, maintenance and in- 
frastructure, etc.; each transcribed  from spoken 
bilingual conversations and manually  translated. 
The SMT parallel training corpus  contains  ap- 
proximately 773K sentence pairs (7.3M English 
words). We used this corpus to extract transla- 
tion phrase pairs from bidirectional IBM Model
4 word alignment (Och and Ney, 2003) based on 
the heuristic approach of (Koehn et al., 2003). A
4-gram target LM was trained on all Iraqi Ara- 
bic transcriptions. Our phrase-based decoder is 
similar to Moses (Koehn  et al., 2007) and uses 
the phrase pairs and target LM to perform  beam 
search stack  decoding  based on a standard  log- 
linear model, the parameters of which were tuned 
with MERT (Och, 2003) on a held-out  develop- 
ment set (3,534 sentence pairs, 45K words) using 
BLEU as the tuning  metric. Finally, we evaluated 
translation  performance  on a separate, unseen test 
set (3,138 sentence pairs, 38K words).
Of  the 773K training sentence  pairs, about
100K (corresponding to 1,600 conversations) are 
marked with conversation boundaries. We use the 
English side of these conversations  for training 
LDA topic models. All other sentence pairs are 
assigned to a “background  conversation”,  which 
signals the absence of the topic similarity feature 
for phrase pairs derived from these instances.  All 
of the development  and test set data were marked 
with conversation boundaries. The training, devel- 
opment and test sets were partitioned  at the con- 
versation level, so that we could model a topic 
distribution for entire conversations, both during 
training and during tuning and testing.

4   Incremental Topic-Based Adaptation

Our approach is based on the premise that biasing 
the translation model to favor phrase pairs origi- 
nating in training conversations that are contextu- 
ally similar to the current conversation will lead 
to better translation quality. The topic distribution 
is incrementally  updated as the conversation his- 
tory grows, and we recompute the topic similarity 
between the current conversation and the training 
conversations for each new source utterance.


4.1   Topic modeling with LDA

We use latent Dirichlet allocation, or LDA, (Blei et 
al., 2003) to obtain  a topic distribution over con- 
versations.  For each conversation  di  in the train- 
ing collection (1,600 conversations), LDA infers a
topic distribution θdi  = p(zk |di) for all latent top- 
ics zk  = {1, ..., K }, where K is the number of
topics. In this work, we experiment with values 
of K ∈ {20, 30, 40}.  The full conversation his-
tory is available for training the topic models and 
estimating topic distributions in the training set.
  At run-time, however,  we construct the con- 
versation history for the tuning and test sets in- 
crementally,  one utterance at a time, mirroring a 
real-world  scenario where our knowledge is lim- 
ited to the utterances that have been spoken up to 
that point in time. Thus, each development/test  ut- 
terance is associated with a different  conversation
history d∗, for which we infer a topic distribution
θd∗ = p(zk |d∗) using the trained LDA model. We
use Mallet (McCallum, 2002) for training topic
models and inferring  topic distributions.

4.2   Topic Similarity Computation

For each test utterance,  we are able to infer the 
topic distribution θd∗  based on the accumulated 
history of the current conversation.   We use this 
to compute  a measure of similarity between the 
evolving  test conversation and each of the train- 
ing conversations, for which we already have topic 
distributions θdi . Because θdi   and θd∗ are proba-

X → Y added to the search graph, its topic simi- 
larity score as follows:


bility distributions, we use the Jensen-Shannon di-
vergence (JSD) to evaluate their similarity (Man- 
ning and Schu¨ tze, 1999). The JSD is a smoothed

Y  =	max
i∈P ar(X →Y )


sim(θdi , θd∗ ) 	(1)


and symmetric version of Kullback-Leibler diver- 
gence,  which is typically used to compare two 
probability distributions. We define the similar-
ity score as sim(θd , θd∗ ) = 1 − J SD(θd ||θd∗ ).1
Thus, we obtain  a vector  of similarity scores in-
dexed by the training conversations.

4.3   Integration with the Decoder

We provide the SMT decoder with the similar- 
ity vector for each test utterance. Additionally, 
the SMT phrase table tracks, for each phrase pair, 
the set of parent training conversations (including 
the “background conversation”) from which that 
phrase pair originated. Using this information, the 
decoder evaluates, for each candidate phrase pair

1 JSD(θd ||θd∗ ) ∈ [0, 1] when defined using log .


where P ar(X   → Y ) is the set of training con-
versations from which the candidate  phrase pair
originated. Phrase pairs from the “background 
conversation” only are assigned a similarity  score 
FX →Y    = 0.00.  In this way we distill the in- 
ferred topic distributions down to a single feature 
for each candidate  phrase pair. We add this fea- 
ture to the log-linear  translation model with its 
own weight, which is tuned with MERT. The in- 
tuition behind this feature is that the lower bound 
of suitability of a candidate phrase pair should be 
directly proportional to the similarity between its 
most relevant conversational provenance and the 
current context.  Phrase pairs which  only occur in 
the background  conversation  are not directly pe- 
nalized, but contribute nothing to the topic simi- 
larity score.

5   Experimental  Setup and Results

The baseline English-to-Iraqi  phrase-based SMT 
system was built as described  in Section 3. This 
system translated each utterance independently, 
ignoring higher-level conversational context.
  For the topic-adapted  system, we compared 
translation performance with a varying  number of 
LDA topics. In intuitive agreement with the ap- 
proximate number of scenario types known to be 
covered by our data set, a range of 20-40 topics 
yielded the best results. We compared the pro- 
posed incremental  topic tracking approach to a 
non-causal oracle approach that had up-front  ac- 
cess to the entire source conversations  at run-time.
  In all cases,  we compared translation  perfor- 
mance on both clean-text and automatic  speech 
recognition (ASR) transcriptions of the source ut- 
terances. ASR transcriptions  were generated using 
a high-performance  two-pass HMM-based  sys- 
tem, which delivered a word error rate (WER) of
10.6% on the test set utterances.
Table 1 summarizes  test set  performance   in
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), NIST (Doddington,
2002) and TER (Snover et al., 2006). Given the 
morphological complexity of Iraqi Arabic, com- 
puting string-based  metrics on raw output can 
be misleadingly low and does not always reflect 
whether the core message was conveyed.  Since 
the primary goal of CSLT is information transfer, 
we present automatic results that are computed af- 
ter stemming with an Iraqi Arabic stemmer.
  We  note that  in  all  settings (incremental 
and non-causal oracle)  our adaptation  approach


matches or significantly  outperforms the baseline 
across multiple evaluation metrics. In particular, 
the incremental LDA system with 40 topics is the 
top-scoring system in both clean-text and ASR set- 
tings. In the ASR setting, which simulates a real- 
world deployment scenario, this system achieves 
improvements  of 0.39 (BLEU), -0.6 (TER) and
0.08 (NIST).

6   Discussion and Future  Directions

We  have  presented  a novel, incremental topic- 
based translation model adaptation approach that 
obeys the causality constraint imposed by spoken 
conversations.   This approach yields statistically 
significant gains in standard MT metric scores.
  We  have also demonstrated  that incremental 
adaptation on an evolving  conversation performs 
better than oracle adaptation  based on the com- 
plete conversation  history.  Although this may 
seem counter-intuitive,  Figure 1 gives clues as to 
why this happens.  This figure illustrates the rank 
trajectory of four LDA topics as  the incremen- 
tal conversation grows. The accompanying text 
shows excerpts from the conversation.  We indi- 
cate (in superscript) the topic identity of most rele- 
vant words in an utterance that are associated with 
that topic. At the first utterance, the top-ranked 
topic is “5”,  due to the occurrence of “captain” 
in the greeting.  As the conversation evolves, we 
note that this topic become less prominent. The 
conversation shifts to a discussion on “windows”, 
raising the prominence of topic “4”. Finally, topic 
“3” becomes prominent due to the presence of the


words “project” and “contract”. Thus, the incre- 
mental approach is able to track the topic trajecto- 
ries in the conversation, and is able to select more 
relevant phrase pairs than oracle LDA, which esti- 
mates one topic distribution  for the entire conver- 
sation.
  In this work we have used only the source lan- 
guage utterance in inferring the topic distribution. 
In a two-way  CLST system, we also have access 
to SMT-generated back-translations in the Iraqi- 
English direction. As a next step, we plan to use 
SMT-generated English translation of Iraqi utter- 
ances to improve topic estimation.
