<S sid ="33" ssid = "5">The ambiguity among words is modelled by confusion sets.</S>
<S sid ="34" ssid = "6">A confusion set C = { w 1, ...,wn} means that each word Wi in the set is ambiguous with each other word in the set.</S>
<S sid ="35" ssid = "7">Thus if C = {deserÂ·t, desserÂ·t}, then when the spelling-correction program sees an occurrence of either desert or dessert in the target document, it takes it to be ambiguous between desert and dessert, and tries to infer from the context which of the two it should be.</S>

<S sid ="88" ssid = "37">Instead, therefore, we assume that the presence of one word in the context is independent of the presence of any other word.</S>
<S sid ="162" ssid = "111">The idea is to discriminate among the words Wi in the confusion set by identifying the collocations that tend to occur around each w;.</S>
