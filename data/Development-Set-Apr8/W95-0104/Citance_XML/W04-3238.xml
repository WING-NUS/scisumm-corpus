			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">The task of general purpose spelling correction has a long history (e.g. Damerau, 1964; Rieseman and Hanson, 1974; McIlroy, 1982), traditionally focusing on resolving typographical errors such as insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions of letters that result in unknown words (i.e. words not found in a trusted lexicon of the language).</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Typical word processing spell checkers compute for each unknown word a small set of in-lexicon alternatives to be proposed as possible corrections, relying on information about in-lexicon-word frequencies and about the most common keyboard mistakes (such as typing m instead of n) and phonetic/cognitive mistakes, both at word level (e.g. the use of acceptible instead of acceptable) and at character level (e.g. the misuse of f instead of ph).</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Very few spell checkers attempt to detect and correct word substitution errors, which refer to the use of in-lexicon words in inappropriate contexts and can also be the result of both typographical mistakes (such as typing coed instead of cord) and cognitive mistakes (e.g. principal and principle).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Some research efforts to tackle this problem have been made; for example Heidorn et al.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">(1982) and Garside et al.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">(1987) developed systems that rely on syntactic patterns to detect substitution errors, while Mays et al.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">(1991) employed word co-occurrence evidence from a large corpus to detect and correct such errors.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">The former approaches were based on the impractical assumption that all possible syntactic uses of all words (i.e. part-of-speech) are known, and presented both recall and precision problems because many of the substitution errors are not syntactically anomalous and many unusual syntactic constructions do not contain errors.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">The latter approach had very limited success under the assumptions that each sentence contains at most one misspelled word, each misspelling is the result of a single point change (insertion, deletion, substitution, or transposition), and the defect rate (the relative number of errors in the text) is known.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">A different body of work (e.g. Golding, 1995; Golding and Roth, 1996; Mangu and Brill, 1997) focused on resolving a limited number of cognitive substitution errors, in the framework of context sensitive spelling correction (CSSC).</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Although promising results were obtained (9295% accuracy), the scope of this work was very limited as it only addressed known sets of commonly confused words, such as {peace, piece}).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">1.1 Spell Checking of Search Engine Queries.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">The task of web-query spelling correction addressed in this work has many similarities to traditional spelling correction but also poses additional challenges.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Both the frequency and severity of spelling errors for search queries are significantly greater than in word processing.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Roughly 1015% of the queries sent to search engines contain errors.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Typically, the validity of a query cannot be decided by lexicon look-up or by checking its gram- maticality.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Because web queries are very short (on average, less than 3 words), techniques that use a multitude of features based on relatively wide context windows, such as those investigated in CSSC, are difficult to apply.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Rather than being well- formed sentences, most queries consist of one concept or an enumeration of concepts, many times containing legitimate words that are not found in any traditional lexicon.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">Just defining what a valid web query is represents a difficult enterprise.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">We clearly cannot use only a static trusted lexicon, as many new names and concepts (such as aznar, blog, naboo, nimh, nsync, and shrek) become popular every day and it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to maintain a high-coverage lexicon.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">In addition, employing very large lexicons can result in more errors surfacing as word substitutions, which are very difficult to detect, rather than as unknown words.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">One alternative investigated in this work is to exploit the continuously evolving expertise of millions of people that use web search engines, as collected in search query logs (seen as histograms over the queries received by a search engine).</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">In some sense, we could say that the validity of a word can be inferred from its frequency in what people are querying for, similarly to Wittgenstein’s (1968) observation that “the meaning of a word is its use in the language”.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">Such an approach has its own caveats.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">For example, it would be er ple, it can be the ratio between the number of letters two words do not have in common and the number of letters they share.1 The two most used classes of distances in spelling correction are edit distances, as proposed by Damerau (1964) and Levenshtein (1965), and correlation matrix distances (Cherkassky et al., 1974).</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">In our study, we use a modified version of the DamerauLev- enshtein edit distance, as presented in Section 3.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">One flaw of the preceding formulation is that it does not take into account the frequency of words in a language.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">A simple solution to this problem is to compute the probability of words in the target language as maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) over a large corpus and reformulate the general spelling-correction problem as follows: roneous to simply extract from web-query logs all the queries whose frequencies are above a certain value and consider them valid.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">Misspelled queries Given w dist (w, w&apos; ) * \ L , find and P(w&apos; ) w&apos; L max v L:dist ( w,v ) such that P(v) . such as britny spears are much more popular than correctly spelled queries such as bayesian nets and amd processors.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Our challenge is to try to utilize query logs to learn what queries are valid, and to build a model for valid query probabilities, despite the fact that a large percentage of the logged queries are misspelled and there is no trivial way to determine the valid from invalid queries.</S>

			<S sid ="34" ssid = "1">Comprehensive reviews of the spelling correction literature were provided by Peterson (1980), Kukich (1992), and Jurafsky and Martin (2000).</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "2">In this section, we survey a few lexicon-based spell In this formulation, all in-lexicon words that are within some “reasonable” distance of the unknown word are considered as good candidates, the correction being chosen based on its prior probability in the language.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "3">While there is an implicit conditioning on the original spelling because of the domain on which the best correction is searched, this objective function only uses the prior probability of words in the language and not the actual distances between each candidate and the input word One solution that allows using a probabilistic edit distance is to condition the probability of a correction on the original spelling P(v | w) :ing correction approaches by using a series of for mal definitions of the task and presenting concrete examples showing the strengths and the limits cor Given w dist (w, w&apos; ) * \ L , find and P(w&apos; | w) w&apos; L max v L:dist ( w,v ) such that P(v | w) . responding to each situation.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "4">We iteratively redefine the problem, starting from an approach purely based on a trusted lexicon and ending up with an approach in which the role of the trusted lexicon is In a noisy channel model framework, as employed for spelling correction by Kernigham et al.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "5">(1990), the objective function can be written by using Bayesian inversion as the product between greatly diminished.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "6">While doing so, we also make concrete forward steps in our attempt to provide a the prior probability of words in a language P(v) definition of valid web queries.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "7">Let be the alphabet of a language and L (the language model), and the likelihood of mis * a spelling a word v as w, P(w | v) (which models the broad-coverage lexicon of the language.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "8">The simplest and historically the first definition of lexicon- based spelling correction (Damerau, 1964) is: noisy channel and will be called the error model).</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "9">In the above formulations, unknown words are corrected in isolation.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "10">This is a rather major flaw Given an unknown word w * \ L , find w&apos; L because context is extremely important for spelling such that dist (w, w&apos; ) min dist (w, v) . v L correction, as illustrated in the following example: p o w e r c r d � p o w e r c o r d i.e. for any out-of-lexicon word in a text, find the video crd � video card closest word form(s) in the available lexicon and hypothesize it as the correct spelling alternative.dist can be any string-based function; for exam 1 Note that the function does not have to be symmetric; thus,.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "11">the notation dist(w,w ) is used with a loose sense.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "12">The misspelled word crd should be corrected to two different words depending on its contexts.2 A formulation of the spelling correction problem that takes into account context is the following: formulation, making it more general and allowing it to cover two other important spelling error classes, concatenation and splitting, e.g.: power point slides � powerpoint slides Given a string s * , s cl wcr , with w * \ L c h a t i n s p a n i c h � c h a t i n s p a n i s h Yet, it still does not account for another important and cl , cr L* , find w&apos; L such that dist (w, w&apos; ) class of cases in web query correction which is and P(w&apos; | cl wcr ) max v L:dist ( w,v ) P(v | cl wcr ) . represented by out-of-lexicon words that are valid in certain contexts (therefore, s&apos; L* ), for example: Spaces and other word delimiters are ignored in this formulation and the subsequent formulations for simplicity, although text tokenization represents an important part of the spelling-correction process, as discussed in Sections 5 and 6.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "13">The task definitions enumerated up to this point (on which most traditional spelling correction systems are based) ignore word substitution errors.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "14">In the case of web searches, it is extremely important to provide correction suggestions for valid words when they are more meaningful as a search query than the original query, for example: golf war � gulf war sap opera � soap opera This problem is partially addressed by the task of CSSC, which can be formalized as follows: amd processors � amd processors (no change) The above phrase represents a legitimate query, despite the fact that it may contain unknown words when employing a traditional English lexicon.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "15">Some even more interesting cases not handled by traditional spellers and also not covered by the latter formulation are those in which in-lexicon words should be changed to out-of-lexicon words, as in the following examples, where two valid words must be concatenated into an out of lexicon word: gun dam planet � gundam planet limp biz kit � limp bizkit These observations lead to an even more general formulation of the spelling-correction problem: Given a set of confusable valid word forms Given s * , find s&apos; * such that dist(s, s&apos; ) in a language W {w1 , w2 ,..., wn } and a string and P(s&apos; | s) max t * :dist ( s ,t ) P(t | s) . s cl wi cr , choose w j W such that For the first time, the formulation no longer P(w | c w c ) max P(w | c w c ) . makes explic it use of a lexico n of the langu age.3 In j l i r k 1..n k l i r some sense, the actual language in which the web In the CSSC literature, the sets of confusables are presumed known, but they could also be built for queries are expressed becomes less important than the query-log data from which the string probabili each in-lexicon word w as all words w&apos; with ties are estimated.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "16">This probability model can be dist (w, w&apos; ) , similarly to the approach investi seen as a substitute for a measure of the meaning gated by Mays et al.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "17">(1991), in which they chose a 1 and employed an edit distance with all point changes having the same cost 1.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "18">The generalized problem of phrasal spelling correction can then be formulated as follows: fulness of strings as web-queries.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "19">For example, an implausible random noun phrase in any of the traditional corpora such as sad tomatoes is meaningful in the context of web search (being the name of a somewhat popular music band).</S>

			<S sid ="61" ssid = "8">At one extreme, the use of a too restrictive function/threshold combination can result in not finding the best correction for a given query.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "9">For example, using the vanilla DamerauLevenshtein edit distance (defined as the minimum number of point changes required to transform a string into another, where a point change is one of the following operations: insertion of a letter, deletion of a letter, and substitution of one letter with another letter) and a threshold 1 , the correction donadl duck � donald duck would not be possible.</S>

			<S sid ="72" ssid = "5">Counts of different (mis)spellings of Albert Einstein’s name in a web query log.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "6">Essential to such an approach are three typical properties of the query logs (e.g. see Table 1): words in the query logs are misspelled in various ways, from relatively easy-to-correct misspellings to very-difficult-to-correct ones, that make the user’s intent almost impossible to recognize; the less malign (difficult to correct) a misspelling is the more frequent it is; the correct spellings tend to be more frequent than misspellings.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "7">In this context, the spelling correction problem can be given the following iterative formulation: Given a string s * , find a sequence 0 * explicitly use a lexicon of the language.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "8">Rather, s1 , s2 ,...sn such that dist(si , si 1 ) , any string that appears in the query log used for training can be considered a valid correction and P(si 1 | si ) max t * :dist ( si ,t ) P(t | si ) , i 0..n 1 , can be suggested as an alternative to the current web query based on the relative frequency of the and P(s n | s n ) max t * :dist ( sn ,t ) P(t | s n ) . query and the alternative spelling.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "9">Thus, a spell checker built according to this formulation could suggest the correction detroittigers because this An example of correction that can be made by iteratively applying the base spell checker is: anol scwartegger � arnold schwarzenegger Misspelled query: anol scwartegger First iteration: arnold schwartnegger Second iteration: arnold schwarznegger Third iteration: arnold schwarzenegger Fourth iteration: no further correction Up to this point, we underspecified the notion of string in the task formulations given.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "10">One possibility is to consider whole queries as the strings to be corrected and iteratively search for better logged queries according to the agreement between their relative frequencies and the character error model.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "11">This is equivalent to identifying all queries in the query log that are misspellings of other queries and for any new query, find a correction sequence of logged queries.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "12">While such an approach exploits the vast information available in web-query logs, it only covers exact matches of the queries that appear in these logs and provides a low coverage of infrequent queries.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "13">For example, a query such as britnet spear inconcert could not be corrected if the correction britney spears in concert does not appear in the employed query log, although the substring britnet spear could be corrected to britney spears.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "14">To address the shortcomings of such an approach, we propose a system based on the following formulation, which uses query substrings: words and word bigrams.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "15">The tokenization process uses space and punctuation delimiters in addition to the information provided about multi-word compounds (e.g. add-on and backup) by a trusted English lexicon with approximately 200k entries.</S>

			<S sid ="120" ssid = "37">Accuracy of various instantiations of the system By completely removing the trusted lexicon, the accuracy of the system on misspelled queries (61.1%) was higher than in the case of only using a trusted lexicon and no query log data (52.8%).</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "38">It can also be observed that the language model built using query logs is by far more important than the A post-analysis of the results showed that the system suggested in many cases reasonable corrections but different from the gold standard ones.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "39">Many false positives could be considered reasonable suggestions, although it is not clear whether they would have been helpful to the users (e.g. 2002 kawasaki ninja zx6e � 2002 kawasaki ninja zx6r was counted as an error, although the suggestion represents a more popular motorcycle model).</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "40">In the case of misspelled queries in which the user’s intent was not clear, the suggestion made by the system could be considered valid despite the fact that it disagreed with the annotators’ choice (e.g. gogle � google instead of the gold standard correction goggle).</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "41">To address the problems generated by the fact that the annotators could only guess the user intent, we performed a second evaluation, on a set of queries randomly extracted from query log data, by sam channel model employed: using a poorer character pling pairs of successive queries (q1 , q2 ) sent by error model by setting all edit weights equal did not have a major impact on performance (66.1% recall), while using a poorer language model that only employs unigram statistics from the query logs crippled the system (41.7% recall).</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "42">Another interesting aspect is related to the number of iterations.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "43">Because the first iteration is more conservative than the following iterations, using only one iteration led to fewer false positives but also to a much lower recall (47.2%).</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "44">Two iterations were sufficient to correct most of the misspelled queries that the full system could correct.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "45">While fringes did not have a major impact on recall, they helped avoid false positives (and had a major impact on speed).</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "46">the same users in which the queries differ from one another by an un-weighted edit distance of at most 1+(len( q1 )+len( q2 ))/10 (i.e. allow a point change for every 5 letters).</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "47">We then presented the list to human annotators who had the option to reject a pair, choose one of the queries as a valid correction of the other, or propose a correction for both when none of them were valid but the intended valid query was easy to guess from the sequence, as in example 3 below: (audio flie, audio file) =&gt; audio file (bueavista, buena vista) =&gt; buena vista (carrabean nooms, carrabean rooms) =&gt; caribbean rooms Table 3 shows the performance obtained by different instantiations of the system on this set.</S>

			<S sid ="132" ssid = "49">Accuracy and recall as functions of the number of monthly query logs used to train the language model Figure 3 shows the performance of the full system as a function of the number of monthly query logs employed.</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "50">While both the total accuracy and the recall increased when using 2 months of data instead of 1 month, by using more query log data (3 and 4 month), the recall (or accuracy on misspelled queries) still improves but at the expense of having more false positives for valid queries, which leads to an overall slightly smaller accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "51">Table 3.</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "52">Accuracy of the proposed system on a set which contains misspelled queries that the users had reformulated The main system disagreed 99 times with the gold standard, in 80 of these cases suggesting a different correction.</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "53">40 of the corrections were not appropriate (e.g. porat was corrected by our system to pirate instead of port in chinese porat also called xiamen), 15 were functionally equivalent corrections given our target search engine (e.g. audio flie � audio files instead of audio file), 17 were different valid suggestions (e.g. bellsouth lphone isting � bellsouth phone listings instead of bellsouth telephone listing), while 8 represented gold standard errors (e.g. the speller correctly suggested brandy sniffters � brandy snifters instead of brandy sniffers).</S>
			<S sid ="137" ssid = "54">Out of 19 cases in which the system did not make a suggestion, 13 were genuine errors (e.g. paul waskiewiscz with the correct spelling paul waskiewicz), 4 were cases in which the original input was correct, although different from the user’s intent (e.g. cooed instead of coed) and 2 were gold standard errors (e.g. commandos 3 walkthrough had the wrong correction commando 3 walkthrough, as this query refers to a popular videogame called “commandos 3”).</S>

			<S sid ="139" ssid = "56">The first number in each column refers to a precision error (i.e. the speller suggested something different than the gold standard), while the second refers to a recall error (i.e. no suggestion).</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "57">As a result of this error analysis, we could arguably consider that while the agreement with the gold standard experiments are useful for measuring the relative importance of components, they do not give us an absolute measure of system usefulness/accuracy.</S>

			<S sid ="142" ssid = "59">As an additional verification and to confirm the difficulty of the test queries, we sent a set of them to Google and observed that Google speller’s agreement with the gold standard was slightly lower than our system’s agreement.</S>
			<S sid ="143" ssid = "60">7 Conclusion.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "61">To our knowledge, this paper is the first to show a successful attempt of using the collective knowledge stored in search query logs for the spelling correction task.</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "62">We presented a technique to mine this extremely informative but very noisy resource that actually exploits the errors made by people as a way to do effective query spelling correction.</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "63">A direction that we plan to investigate is the adaptation of such a technique to the general purpose spelling correction, by using statistics from both query-logs and large office document collections.</S>
