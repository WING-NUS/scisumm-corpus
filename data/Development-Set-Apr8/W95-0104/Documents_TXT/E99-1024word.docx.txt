Abstract

In this paper,  we propose a practical 
method to detect Japanese homophone 
errors in Japanese texts.    It is very 
important to  detect  homophone  errors 
in Japanese revision systems because 
Japanese  texts suffer from homophone 
errors frequently.  In order  to detect  ho­ 
mophone errors,  we have  only  to solve 
the homophone problem. We can use the 
decision list  to do it  because  the homo­ 
phone problem is equivalent  to the word 
sense disambiguation problem.  However, 
the homophone problem is different from 
the word sense disambiguation problem 
because the former can use the written 
word but  the latter  cannot.   In this  pa­ 
per, we incorporate the written  word into 
the original decision list by obtaining  the 
identifying strength  of the written word. 
The improved decision list can raise the 
F-measure of error detection.


1   Introduction

In  this  paper,  we propose  a  method  of detect­ 
ing Japanese  homophone errors in Japanese  texts. 
Our method is based on a decision list proposed by 
Yarowsky (Yarowsky, 1994; Yarowsky, 1995).  We 
improve  the  original decision list  by  using writ­ 
ten words in the default evidence.  The imprqved 
decision list can  raise the  F-measure  of error  de­ 
tection.
Most Japanese  texts are written  using Japanese
word  processors.   To input  a  word composed  of 
kanji characters, we first input  the phonetic  hira­ 
gana sequence for the word, and  then  convert  it 
to the desired  kanji sequence.  However, multiple 
converted kanji sequences are generally produced, 
and  we must  then  choose  the  correct  kanji  se­ 
quence. Therefore,  Japanese  texts suffer from ho-


mophone errors caused by incorrect choices. Care­ 
lessness of choice alone is not the cause of homo­ 
phone errors; Ignorance of the difference among 
homophone  words is serious.  For example,  many 
Japanese  are not aware of the difference between
'i':' and 'i':.\ V, or between 'fil.' and  'fil.l!l'  1
  In this paper,  we define the term homophone 
set  as a set  of words consisting  of kanji charac­ 
ters that  have the same  phone 2 •  Then,  we define 
the  term  homophone word as a word in a ho­ 
mophone set.  For example,  the set {$ (proba­ 
bility),   JL  (establishment)} is a homophone set 
because  words in  the  set  are  composed  of kanji 
characters that  have the same phone 'ka-ku-ri-tu'. 
Thus,' $' and ' JL' are homophone words. In 
this paper,  we name the  problem of choosing the 
correct  word from the homophone set the homo­ 
phone problem. In order  to detect  homophone 
errors,  we make a list  of homophone  sets in ad­ 
vance, find a  homophone  word in  the  text,  and 
then solve the homophone  problem for the homo­ 
phone word.
  Many methods of solving the homophone  prob­ 
lem  have  been  proposed  (Tochinai  et  al.,  1986; 
lbuki et al., 1997; Oku and  Matsuoka, 1997; Oku,
1994; Wakita and  Kaneko, 1996).  However, they 
are restricted  to the homophone  problem, that  is, 
they  are  heuristic  methods.   On  the  other  hand, 
the homophone problem is equivalent to the word 
sense disambiguation problem if the phone of the 
homophone word is regarded as the word, and the 
homophone word as the sense. Therefore,  we can 
solve the  homophone  problem  by  using  various

  1•;if.;t:;' and  · . (!. ,' have  a same  phone  'i-shi'. The 
meaning of ':if..'i!,!,' is a general  will, and the meaning of
•;if.;E=:' is a strong  positive  will. '@:' and  '@:lil' have
a same phone  'cho-kkan'. The meaning  of'@:' is an
intuition through  a feeling, and  the meaning  of '@:lil' 
is an intuition through a latent knowledge.
     2 We ignore  the difference  of accents, stresses  and 
parts of speech.   That is,  the  homophone set  is  the 
set of words having the same expression in hiragana 
characters.






statistical methods proposed for the word sense 
disambiguation   problem(Fujii,  1998).    Take  the 
case of context-sensitive  spelling  error  detection
3, which is equivalent to the homophone problem. 
For that  problem, some statistical methods  have 
been applied and succeeded(Golding, 1995; Gold­
ing and Schabes, 1996).   Hence, statistical meth­ 
ods are certainly  valid for the  homophone  prob­ 
lem.   In  particular,   the  decision  list  is valid for 
the homophone problem(Shinnou, 1998). The de­ 
cision list arranges  evidences to identify the word 
sense in the order of strength of identifying the 
sense. The word sense is judged  by the evidence, 
with the highest identifying strength, in the con­ 
text.
  Although the homophone problem is equivalent 
to the word sense disambiguation problem, the 
former has  a  distinct  difference from  the  latter. 
In the homophone problem, almost  all of the an­ 
swers are given correctly, because almost all of the 
expressions written  in the given text  are correct. 
It is difficult to decide  which is the  meaning  of
'crane',  'crane  of animal'  or 'crane  of tool'.  How­ 
ever, it is almost right that  the correct expression 
of '.Jii.lL' in  a  text  is  not  'lit$' but  '.Jii3t'. In 
the  homophone problem,  the  choice of the  writ­ 
ten word results in high precision. We should use 
this information.  However, the method  to always
choose the written  word is useless for error detec­ 
tion because it doesn't detect errors at all. The 
method  used for the  homophone  problem should 
be evaluated  from the precision and  the  recall of 
the error detection.  In this  paper,  we evaluate  it 
by the  F-measure  to  combine  the  precision  and 
the recall, and  use the  written  word to raise the 
F-measure of the original decision list.
  We use the  written  word as an evidence of the 
decision list.  The  problem is how much strength 
to give to that  evidence.  If the strength is high, 
the  precision rises but  the  recall drops.   On  the 
other hand, if the strength  is low, the decision list 
is not improved.  In  this paper,  we calculate  the 
strength  that  gives the maximum  F-measure in a 
training corpus.  As a result, our decision list can 
raise the F-measure of error detection.

2 	Homophone disambiguation by  a 
decision list

In this section,  we describe how to construct  the 
decision list and to apply it to the homophone 
problem.

3For   example,  confusion between  'peace'  and
'piece', or  between 'quiet' and  'quite' is  the  context­
sensitive spelling error.


2.1 	Construction of the decision list
The decision list is constructed   by the  following 
steps.

step 1 Prepare  homophone sets.

  In this paper, we use the 12 homophone sets 
shown  in  Table 1,  which  consist  of  homophone 
words that  tend to be mis-chosen.


Table 1: Homophone sets
Phone 	I  Homophone set


















step 2  Set context information,  i.e. evidences, to 
identify  the homophone word.

We use the following three kinds of evidence.

• word ( w) in front  of H: Expressed as w-

• word (w) behind  H: Expressed as w+

• jiritu  words 4   surrounding   H: We  pick  up 
the  nearest  three  jiritu words in front of and 
behind  H respectively.   We express  them  as 
w±3.

step 3 Derive  the  frequency  f rq( Wi,e;) of  the 
collocation  between the homophone word Wi 
in  the  homophone  set {w1, w2, ···, wn} and 
the evidence e;,  by using a training  corpus.

For example, let us consider the homophone set
{:JIM: (running  (of a ship,  etc.)),   jifr (running
(of a train,  etc.))} and the following two Japanese
sentences.
Sentence 1 I "® 0)!$.\.i.l'::::. J. - r Jv "t'' 11Hr m€0) :ii
Mitx: !Ct 	:>j: '/,)>-? t::. o J
(A west wind of 3 m/s  did  not  prevent  the 
plane from flying.)
    4 The  jiritu. word is defined  as an independent word 
which  can  form  one  bun-setu by itself.  Nouns, verbs 
and  adjectives are  examples.

Sentence 2   f !f.W:Ii(J))Iqfp;J rdj !N*fsnt.:      o J 
(Running hours in the early morning and dur­ 
ing the night were shortened.)

  From sentence  I, we can extract  the following 
evidences for the word 'iiRit':
"1:+"' 	"(f) -"' "1R;qit t ±3"'  "=±3"'
"Jll.. ±3"' "::t ±3"' " "\ ±3"'
and from sentence 2, we can extract  the following

evidences for the word •)Iqf•:

"H ra, +",  "(J) -", "	±3",  "!f.Wl ±3",
"IJ;Jra, ±3",  "N*fs ±3",  "To ±3".


step 4  Define the strength est( Wi, e;) of estimat­
ing  that  the  homophone  word Wi  is correct



{est( w1, e; ), est( w2, e;), ···,est( w,., e;)},
and  set  the  word  w1c   as  the  answer for  the 
evidence e;. In this case, the identifying 
strength is est( w1c, e;).

  For example, by steps  4 and 5 we can construct 
the list shown in Table 2.

step 6 Fix the  answer  w1c;  for  each e;  and  sort 
identifying  strengths est( w1c;, e;) in order  of 
dimension, but remove the evidence whose 
identifying  strength is less  than  the  identi­ 
fying strength est(w1c;, default) for  the  evi­ 
dence  default from the list.  This is the deci­ 
sion list.

  After step  6, we obtain  the decision list for the 
homophone set { ii-M:, jlqf }as shown in Table  3.

a in the above expression is included to avoid 
the unsatisfactory  case of  frq(wi,e;) = 0. In 
this  paper,  we set a  = 0.15 . We also use the
special  evidence  default. frq(wi,default)  is 
defined as the frequency of Wi.

step 5  Pick   the   highest   strength  est( w1c, e;)

2.2     Solving by a decision 
list
In order to solve the homophone problem by the 
decision list, we first find the homophone  word w 
in the given text,  and then extract evidences E for 
the word w from the text:







  Next,  picking up  the  evidence from  the  deci­ 
sion list for the homophone set for the homophone 
word win  order of rank, we check whether the ev­ 
idence is in the set E. If the evidence ei  is in the 
set  E, the  answer Wlc;   for ei  is judged  to be the 
correct expression for the homophone word w. If 
w1ci  is equal to w,  w is judged  to be correct,  and 
if it is not equal, then it is shown that  w  may be 
the error for Wier

3  Use  of the  written word

In  this section,  we describe  the  use of the  writ­ 
ten word in the homophone  problem and  how to 
incorporate  it into the decision list.

3.1     Evaluation of error detection systems
As described in the Introduction, the written word 
cannot be used in the word sense disambiguation 
problem,  but  it is useful for solving homophone 
problems.  The method used for the homophone 
problem is  trivial  if the  method  is evaluated  by 
the precision of distinction  using the following for­ 
mula:

number  of   correct   discriminations 
number    of   all   discriminations


this  paper,  we regard  the written  word as a .kind 
of evidence on context, and  give it an identifying 
strength.  Consequently  we can  use the  written 
word in the decision list.

3.3 		Calculation of the 
identifying strength of  the 
written word
First,  let z be the identifying strength of the writ­ 
ten  word.    We name  the  set  of evidences  with 
higher identifying  strength than  z the set a, 
and the set of evidences with lower identifying 
strength than  z the set {3,
  Let T  be the  number  of homophone  problems 
for a homophone set.  We solve them  by the orig­
inal decision list  D LO . Let G (or H)  be the ratio 
of the  number of homophone problems by judged
by a (or {3) toT. Let g (or h) be the precision of 
a  (or {3), and  p be the occurrence  probability of 
the homophone error.
The  number  of problems correctly  solved by a
is as follows:
GT(1- p), 	(2)

and the number of problems incorrectly  solved by
a is as follows:



That  is,  if  the  expression  is  'liM!:' (or  •j qf'), 
then  we should  clearly  choose  the  word  'liM!:' 
(or  the  word •j qf')  from  the homophone  set  { 
JIM:, JJ;qf }. This  distinction  method  probably 
has better  precision than  any other  methods  for 
the word sense disambiguation problem. However, 
this method  is useless because it does not detect 
errors at all.
  The method for the homophone problem should 
be evaluated from the standpoint of not error dis­ 
crimination  but error detection.  In this paper,  we 
use the F-measure (Eq.1) to combine the precision 
P and the recall R defined as follows:

P = number of   real   errors in  detected   errors 
number    of   detected   errors
R = number  of   real   errors in  detected   errors 
number   of   errors  m   the   te:r:t


GTp. 	(3)

The number of problems detected as errors in Eq.2 
and  Eq.3 are GT(1- p)(1- g) and GTpg  respec­ 
tively. Thus,  the number of problems detected  as 
errors by a is as follows:

GT((1- p)(1- g)+ pg). 	(4)

In the same way, the number of problems detected
as errors  by {3 is as follows:

HT((1- p)(1- h)+ ph). 	(5)

Consequently   the  total  number  of problems  de­
tected  as errors is as follows:

T(G((1-p)(1-g) +pg) +H((1- p)(1- h) +ph)).
                                       (6) 
The   number   of  correct   detections  in   Eq.6  is 
Tp(Gg  + Hh). Therefore  the  precision  Po is as


F=  2PR 
P+R



(1)


follows:

Po	p(Gg + 
Hh)/{G((1- p)(1- g)+ pg)


3.2     Use  of  the identifying strength of  the
written word
The  distinction   method   to  choose  the  written 
word is useless,  but  it  has a  very high  precision 
of error discrimination.  Thus,  it  is valid to  use 
this method  where it is difficult to use context  to 
solve the homophone problem.
The question  is  when to  stop  using  the  deci­
sion from context  and  use the  written  word.  In


+ H((1- p)(1- h)+ ph)}

Because the  number  of real errors in T  is Tp,  the 
recall Ro is Gg+Hh. By using Po and Ro, we can 
get the  F-measure  Fo of DLO by Eq.l.
  Next,  we construct  the decision list incorporat­ 
ing the written  word into DLO. We name this deci­ 
sion list DL1. In DL1, we use the written  word to 
solve problems which we cannot judge by a. 
That










 









DLO


DL1




Figure 1: Construction of DL1




is, DL1 is the decision list  to attach the  written 
word as the default evidence to a: (see Fig.1).
  Next, we calculate  the precision and  the recall 
of DLl.  Because a: of DL1 is the same as that  of 
DLO, the number of problems detected as errors by 
a: is given by Eq.4. In the case of DL1, problems
judged  by  f3  of  DLO are  judged  by  the  written
word.   Therefore,  we detect  no error  from these 
problems.
  As a result, the number of problems detected as 
errors by DL1 is given by Eq.4, and the number of 
real errors in these detections is TGpg. Therefore, 
the precision P1 of DL1 is as follows:

Pt = 	pg
(1-p)(1-g)+pg

Because  the  number  of whole errors  is Tp,  the 
recall R 1 of DL1 is Gg.  By using P1 and  Rt. we 
can get the F-measure  F1 of DL1 by Eq.l.
  Finally, we try to define the identifying strength 
x.  xis the value that  yields the maximum F1 un­ 
der  the condition  F1 > Fo. However, theoretical 
calculation  alone cannot  give x,  because p is un­ 
known,  and  functions  of G,H,g, and  hare  also 
unknown.
In this paper, we set p = 0.05, and get values of
G, H, g, and h by using the training  corpus which
is the resource used to construct  the original deci­
sion list DLO. Take the case of the homophone set
{'JIJIDi:', 'JI{f'}. For this homophone set, we try to 
get values ofG,H,g, and h. The  training  corpus
has 2,890 sentences which include the word 'JIJIDi:' 
or the word 'JI{f'. These 2,890 sentences are ho­ 
mophone problems for that  homophone set.  The
identifying  strength   of DLO for  this  homophone 
set covers from 0.046 to 9.453 as shown in Table 3.
Next we give x a value.  For example,  we set  x =
2.5.  In this case, the number of problems judged


by a: is 1,631, and the number of correct judgments 
in  them  is 1,593.   Thus,  G = 1631/2890 = 0.564
and  g = 1593/1631 = 0.977.    In  the  same  way,
under   this   assumption    x            2.5,   the   num­
ber   of  problems   judged   by  f3   is   1,259,  and 
the    number    of   correct   judgments   in   them
is   854.       Thus,    H = 1259/2890 = 0.436   and 
h = 854/1259 = 0.678.   As a  result,  if  x  =  2.5, 
then   Po  = 0.225,  Ro   =  0.847,  Fo  =  0.356, 
Pt = 0.688, R1 = 0.551 and  Ft = 0.612. In Fig.2, 
Fig.3 and  Fig.4,  we show  the  experiment result 
when x varies from 0.0 to 10.0 in units of 0.1. By
choosing the  maximum  value of F1 in  Fig.4,  we 
can get the desired x. In this homophone set, we 
obtain  x = 3.0.

4    Experiments

First,  we obtain  each identifying  strength of the 
written  word for  the  12 homophone  sets  shown 
in Table 1,  by the above method.   We show this 
result  in  Table 4.   LRO in  this  table  means  the 
lowest rank  of DLO. That  is, LRO is the rank  of 
the default evidence.  LR1 means the lowest rank 
ofDLl. That  is, LR1 is the rank of the evidence of 
the written  word. Moreover, LRO and LR1 mean 
the sizes of each decision list DLO and  DLl.
Second,  we extract  sentences  which include  a
word in the 12 homophone sets from a corpus.  We 
note that  this corpus is different from the training 
corpus; the corpus is one year's worth of Mainichi 
newspaper articles,  and the training corpus is one 
year's worth of Nikkei newspaper articles.   The 
extracted  sentences are the test sentences of the 
experiment.  We assume that  these sentences have 
no homophone errors.
  Last, we randomly select 5% of the test sen­ 
tences,  and  forcibly  put  homophone  errors  into 
these selected sentences  by changing  the  written

word. As a result,  the test sentences include  
5% errors. From these test  sentences,  we detect  
homophone errors by DLO and DL1 
respectively.
  We conducted  this  experiment  ten  times,  
and got the  mean of the precision,  the  recall 
and  the F-measure.  The result is shown in 
Table 5.
  For all homophone sets, the F-measure of our 
proposed DL1 is higher than  the F-measure of 
the original decision list DLO. Therefore,  it is 
con­ cluded that  our proposed method  is 
effective.

5    
Remarks

The  recall of DL1 is no more than  the  recall 
of DLO.  Our  method  aims  to  raise  the  F-
measure by raising  the  precision instead  of 
sacrificing the recall. We confirmed the validity 
of the method by experiments in sections 3 and 
4. Thus our method has only  a  little  effect if 
the  recall is evaluated
with importance.  However, we should  note  
that

because the  precision of judgment  by 
the  written word improves  without  
lowering the  recall.   The recall does  
not  fall due  to smaller  p because  Ro 
and R1 are independent of p. 
Moreover, from the definitions of Po 
and  P1, we can confirm that  the 
precision of judgments  by the written  
word im­ proves with smaller p.

  The number of elements of all  homophone sets 
used in this paper was two, but the number of 
elements of real homophone sets may be more. 
However, the  bigger  this  number  is,  the  better 
the  result  produced  by our  method,  because  the 
precision of judgments by the default evidence of 
DLO drops in this case, but that of DL1 does not. 
Therefore, our method  is better than  the original 
one even if the  number of elements  of the homo­ 
phone set increases.
  Our method  has an advantage that  the size of 
DL1 is smaller.  The  size of the  decision list  has 
no relation  to  the  precision and  the recall,  but  a 
small decision list  has advantages of efficiency of 
calculation  and  maintenance.
  On the other hand, our method has a problem in 
that  it does not use the written  word in the judg­ 
ment from a:; Even the identifying  strength of the 
evidence in a: must depend  on  the  written  word. 
We intend  to study  the  use of the  written  word 
in the judgment from a:.  Moreover, homophone 
errors in our experiments  are artificial.   We must 
confirm the effectiveness of the  proposed method 
for actual  homophone  errors.

6 	Conclusions

In this paper, we used the decision list to solve the 
homophone problem.  This strategy was based on 
the fact that  the homophone problem is equivalent 
to the word sense disambiguation problem.  How­ 
ever, the homophone problem is different from the 
word sense disambiguation problem  because  the 
former  can  use  the  written  word  but  the  latter 
cannot.   In this  paper,  we incorporated the  writ­ 
ten word into  the original decision list by obtain-


ing the identifying  strength of the  written  word. 
We used 12 homophone  sets  in  experiments.  In 
these experiments, our  proposed decision list had 
a higher  F-measure  than  the  original  one.  A fu­ 
ture  task  is to further integrate context  and  the 
written  word in the decision list.
