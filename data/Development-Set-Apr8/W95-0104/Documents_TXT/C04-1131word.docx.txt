Abstract

This article describes the results of a systematic in- 
depth study of the criteria used for word sense 
disambiguation. Our study is based on 60 target 
words: 20 nouns, 20 adjectives and 20 verbs. Our 
results are not always in line with some practices in 
the field. For example, we show that omitting non- 
content words decreases performance and that 
bigrams yield better results than unigrams.

1	Introduction

  The task of word sense disambiguation (WSD) is 
to identify the correct sense of a word in context. 
WSD  is  usually  performed  by  matching 
information from the context in which the word 
occurs with disambiguation knowledge source. Our 
approach uses supervised machine-learning 
techniques to automatically acquire such 
disambiguation knowledge from sense-tagged 
corpora. At present, this type of approach is widely 
used and seems to yield the best results (Kilgarriff, 
Rosenzweig, 2000; Ng, 1997b).
  Information conveyed by context words 
(morphological form) is enriched with further 
annotations: part-of-speech tag, lemma, etc. Each 
individual piece of information is called a feature. 
A good feature should capture an important source 
of knowledge that is critical in determining the 
sense of the word to be disambiguated. The choice 
of the appropriate set of features is an important 
issue for WSD (Bruce, Wiebe, Perdersen, 1996; 
Ng, Zelle, 1997; Pedersen, 2001). Thus, this paper 
describes the results of a systematic and in-depth 
study of homogenous criteria (i.e. set of features) 
that can be used for WSD.

2	Methodology

2.1	Corpus

  The corpus we worked on is composed of 
different types of texts and comprises 6 468 522 
words. It was put together within the framework of


lexical tagging of 60 target words selected for their 
strongly   polysemous   nature   (Véronis,   1998)1. 
These 60 target words are evenly divided into 20 
nouns, 20 adjectives and 20 verbs, having a total of
53 796 occurrences in the corpus.
  The  inadequacy  of  standard  dictionaries 
(Véronis, 2001) and computational lexicons 
(Palmer, 1998) for natural language processing is 
presently one of the major difficulties encountered 
in word sense disambiguation. For instance, by 
using these dictionaries, the inter-annotator 
agreement may sometimes reach only 57% (Ng, 
Lee, 1996) or may simply be equivalent to random 
sense allocation (Véronis, 1998). To overcome this 
weakness, a dictionary more specific to natural 
language  processing  is  being  developed  in  our 
team (Reymond, 2002). It has been used to tag the 
occurrences of the 60 target words of the SyntSem 
corpus.
  Table 8 in the appendix gives quantitative 
information for each target word. The number of 
senses per word may be very large for it includes 
idioms  and  phrasal  verbs  such  as:  « mettre  sur 
pied », « mettre à pied », « pied de nez », etc.
  A general agreement seems to emerge according 
to   which   morpho-syntatic  disambiguation  and
sense disambiguation can be disentangled 
(Kilgarriff, 1997; Ng, Zelle, 1997). We have 
entrusted the part-of-speech tagging of our corpus 
to  the  Cordial  software  (developed  by  Synapse
Développement      company)      as      it      offers
lemmatisation and part-of-speech tagging of a 
satisfactory accuracy (Valli, Véronis, 1999).

corpus. It shows all the tags of each word. We use 
the  information  provided  by  these  tags  in  our 
lexical disambiguation criteria.

2.2	Criteria

  The  aim  of  our  study  is  to  evaluate  a  large 
variety of homogenous criteria (i.e. set of features). 
The name of each criterion specifies its nature and 
takes the following form [par1|par2|par3|par4]. 
Parameter  par1  indicates  whether  the  criterion 
takes into account unigrams (par1=1gr), bigrams 
(par1=2gr) or trigrams (par1=3gr), knowing that 
an n-gram represents the juxtaposition of n words. 
Parameter par2 indicates which word tag is 
considered: morphological form (par2=mform), 
lemma (par2=lemma), part-of-speech (par2=ems) 
or coarse-grained part-of-speech (par2=cgems). 
Parameter par3 indicates if we take into account 
word positions (par3=position), if we only 
distinguish left from right context (par3=leftright), 
or if we simply consider unordered set of 
surrounding words (par3=unordered). Lastly, 
parameter par4 shows whether the criterion takes 
into account all the words (par4=all) or content 
words only (par3=content). We call these criteria 
“homogeneous criteria” as the four parameters 
together determine the nature of all pieces of 
contextual evidence selected by the criterion.
  For contexts within a range of ±1 to ± 8 words, 
the combination of all parameters generates 576 
(3¯4¯3¯2¯8) distinct criteria. We have 
systematically evaluated each one of these criteria 
as well as other criteria in order to answer specific 
questions and to validate or invalidate certain 
hypothesis.
  Within the framework of this study, we have 
developed an application used to model these 
criteria and to further apply them to the corpus in 
order to generate feature vectors used by our 
classifiers (Audibert, 2001).

2.3	Classifiers

  We have selected two complementary classifiers. 
We have chosen the Naïve-Bayes classifier (NB) 
for its simplicity and widespread use, as well as for 
its well-known state-of-the-art accuracy on 
supervised WSD (Domingos, Pazzani, 1997; 
Mooney, 1996; Ng, 1997a). The NB classifier 
assumes the features are independent given the 
sense. During classification, it chooses the sense 
with  the  highest  posterior  probability. We  have 
also selected a decision list classifier (DL) which is 
similar to the classifier used by (Yarowsky, 1994) 
for  words  having  two  senses,  and  extended  for 
more senses by (Golding, 1995). DL classifier is 
further  developed  in  (Audibert,  2003).  In  DL,


features are sorted in order of decreasing strength, 
where strength reflects feature reliability for 
decision-making. The DL classifier distinguishes 
itself clearly from the NB classifier as it does not 
combine the features, but bases its classifications 
solely on the single most reliable feature identified 
in the target context selected by the criteria. We 
will make a use of this decision-making 
transparency several times in this article. Some 
other advantages of DL classifier are its significant 
simplicity and its ease of implementation.
  Both  of  the  classifiers  we  used  require 
probability estimates. Given  the  data-sparseness, 
we have to deal with zero or low frequency counts. 
For this reason, we have decided to use m- 
estimation (Cussens, 1993) rather than classical 
estimations of probabilities or Laplace (“add one”) 
smoothing.
  When a classifier is not able to disambiguate a 
target word, which is very rare, it selects the most 
frequent sense from the training data. Thus, all 
occurrences are tagged. As in this case precision 
equals the recall, the present article speaks in terms 
of precision only.
  To evaluate a criterion in the corpus, we use a k- 
fold cross-validation method (in accordance with 
the common use, in our experiment, k=10). Despite 
the fact that this method takes much computing 
time, it enables the evaluation of the criterion in 
the whole corpus.
  Throughout the tests, the two classifiers have 
generally obtained comparable accuracy, although 
the NB classifier has almost systematically 
outperformed the DL classifier.

3     Results

3.1    Best criteria precision

  Table 2 displays for each of the target words 
studied the optimal context size and the 
disambiguation precision obtained by the best 
unigram, bigram and trigram-based criteria.
  This table points out that best criteria take into 
account all words in the context. Section 3.2 will 
concentrate on feature reliability according to their 
part-of-speech. Then, section 3.2 will deal with the 
impact  of  different  feature  selections  based  on

  According to the Table 2, the optimal context 
size comprises ±1 to ±5 words. Further 
developments of the context optimality will be 
made in section 3.4.
Surprisingly, Table 2 outlines the fact that the
criterion that obtains the best precision is based on 
bigrams and not on unigrams. This subject is dealt 
with in section 3.5.

3.2    The most reliable parts-of-speech

  In this section, we aim at learning the part-of- 
speech and the space distribution of all pieces of 
contextual evidence used for disambiguation.
  To this end, we use the DL classifier because it 
bases its classifications solely on the most reliable 
piece of evidence identified by the criteria. Thus, 
DL classifier enables us to learn which is the part- 
of-speech   and   the   space   distribution   of   this
indicator         by         using         the         criterion
[1gr|mform|ordered|all]. Table 3 and graphics 
presented in Figure 1 synthesize this study results.
  Table 3 enables to bring out the following results 
(we quote between brackets and in order the main 
results obtained for the nouns, the adjectives and 
the verbs):
• common nouns (NCOM) obtain one of the best 
precisions (93.0%; 93.7%; 87.8%) and represent 
one of the most used indicators (12.7%; 25.3%;
26%) for the three term categories;
• adjectives (ADJ) represent good indicators for 
nouns (p=94.9%) and adjectives (p=80.3%), but 
they are especially useful for nouns since they 
are used in 13.7% of the cases against 2.2% only 
for the adjectives;
• adverbs (ADV) are mainly useful for adjectives; 
their precision reaches 79.2% and they are used 
in 9.6% of the cases;
• verbs in the infinitive (VINF) are very reliable 
indicators for the three parts-of-speech (90.2%;
80.6%; 87.2%), but they are rarely used as they 
are not very often encountered in the context 
(0.9%; 0.7%; 2.9%);
• conjugated verbs (VCON) obtain poor precision
(67.9%; 53.9%; 54.4%).
  Figure 1 graphics show the space distribution of 
the main parts-of-speech of the indicators used to 
disambiguate each one of the three term categories. 
The dissymmetric shape of verbs, and more 
precisely, the strong prevalence of indicators 
located in position +1, +2, +3, makes us believe
that    disambiguating    verbs    is    done    more
accordingly to  their  object than  to  their  subject 
since as a rule the main form encountered is 
subject–verb–object.

  Table 4  summarizes these graphs. Our results 
and those of (Yarowsky, 1993) agree in many 
respects, although his study applies only to pseudo- 
words having only two “senses”:
• “Adjectives   derive   almost   all   of   their 
disambiguating information from the nouns they 
modify”;
• “Nouns   are   best   disambiguated   by   directly 
adjacent adjectives or nouns”;
• “Verbs derive more disambiguating information 
from their objects than from their subjects”.

Table 5: precision decrease when omitting non- 
content words using DL classifier.

  Many studies do not consider all the words of 
the context (El-Bèze, Loupy, Marteau, 1998; 
Mooney, 1996; Ng, Lee, 2002). The assumption 
according to which content words represent the 
most reliable indicators underlies the choice to use 
only content words based criteria. This seems to be 
obvious, but it is not confirmed in Table 2. Table 5 
shows the average decrease of the precision of the 
content words based criteria 
([par1|par2|par3|content]) compared to the same 
criteria based on all words ([par1|par2|par3|all]). 
This table shows that the decrease is low when the 
criteria are based on unigrams and are used to 
disambiguate nouns, but it can become very high 
in the other cases, and in particular for verbs 
disambiguation.
  Table 3 informs us about the disambiguation 
precision according to the coarse-grained part-of- 
speech tag. This table shows that using content 
words only is probably not the most appropriate 
feature selection (for example inflected verbs are 
not relevant). We have therefore chosen to try out a 
more subtle selection (we refer to it by 
par4=selected) by restraining to the most reliable 
parts-of-speech according to Table 3:
• For   nouns,   we   use   indicators   having   the 
following coarse-grained part-of-speech tagging:



Table 6: precision with and without feature 
selections using NB classifier.

NCOM, PREP, ADJ, SUB, VINF, NPRO, VPAR
or PRODE;
• For  adjectives,  we  use  indicators  having  the 
following coarse-grained part-of-speech tagging: 
NCOM, DET, ADJ, ADV, VINF or NPRO;
• For verbs, we use indicators having the following 
coarse-grained part-of-speech tagging: NCOM, 
ADJ, PROPE, PCTFORTE, SUB, VINF, NPRO, 
VPAR or PRODE.
Table  6  gives  a  comparison  of  the  precision 
reached by the following 3 criteria:
• [1gr|mform|ordered|all],
• [1gr|mform|ordered|content],
• [1gr|mform|ordered|selected].
We observe that this subtler selection lowers the 
disambiguation precision too. We assume then that 
all words, whatever their part-of-speech, contribute 
to the disambiguation.

3.4    Optimal context

3.4.1 Size and symmetry
  We   tested   up   to   ±10 000   word   contexts. 
However, the best precision is always obtained for 
short contexts ranging from ±1 to ±5 words. These 
results are similar to those obtained by many other 
researches (El-Bèze, et al., 1998; Yarowsky, 1993;
2000).
  Optimal context size is criteria, target part-of- 
speech and n-gram size dependent. In particular, it 
increases with the n-gram size.
  Table 7 shows, for all the criteria we examined, 
the average size of the optimal context by the n- 
gram size and by the part-of-speech.
The main indicators used to disambiguate nouns
and adjectives surround roughly symmetrically the 
word we want to disambiguate. On the contrary, 
indicators for verbs tend to be mainly situated after 
the verb. Therefore, a non-symmetrical context 
shifted forward by a word proves to be more 
appropriate. Our experiments show that the use of 
this shifted context improves the precision of the 
verbs disambiguation by 0.75% in average.

Table 7: optimal context size using both 
classifiers.


3.4.2 Do  n-grams  have  to  contain  the  target 
word?
  The lemma being unique for a given word, if 
only lemmas are considered, an n-gram which is 
adjacent to the target word contains precisely the 
same information as the same n-gram to which the 
target word is added in order to compose a (n+1)- 
gram. The n-gram that is situated next to the word 
to  disambiguate  can  thus  be  assimilated  to  the 
(n+1)-gram which contains it. Consequently, the 
question becomes: do n-grams have to contain the 
word to disambiguate or at least to be adjacent to 
it? Several studies set themselves this constraint 
probably because n-grams are used to capture fixed 
constructions containing the word to disambiguate. 
Table 2 shows that the optimal context size for 
best bigram or trigram-based criteria does not fit 
this   constraint.  The   relevant  n-grams  do   not 
necessarily  contain  the  target  word  and  are  not 
necessarily adjacent to it. For example, for nouns 
and  verbs, the  ±4  words context is  the  optimal 
context  size  of  the  bigram-based  criteria  which 
obtains  the  best  disambiguation  precision.  This 
criterion produces some bigrams separated from 
the target word by one or two words. However, 
this single observation cannot enable us to abandon 
the  constraint  in  terms  of  containing  or  being 
adjacent to  the  target  word. Indeed, the  bigram 
increasing	distance	may	help	locating	an 
information which could be captured by the joint 
use of one or several larger n-grams. We have thus 
evaluated a combination of criteria in which all n- 
grams contain the target word in a context up to ±4
words:
• [2gr|lemma|leftright|all] with context size of ±1 
words;
• [3gr|lemma|leftright|all] with context size of ±2 
words;
• [4gr|lemma|leftright|all] with context size of ±3 
words;
• [5gr|lemma|leftright|all] with context size of ±4 
words.
This combination leads to a disambiguating 
precision of 74.3%, which is lower than the one 
obtained  using  the  criteria 
[2gr|lemma|leftright|all] alone with a ±4 words 
context.  This  experiment  confirms  that 
constraining the context to contain the word to 
disambiguate, or at least to be adjacent to it, 
decreases disambiguation accuracy. Consequently, 
nothing justifies this constraint on criteria.

3.5    Surprising bigrams accuracy

  Contrary to all expectations, Table 2 shows that 
the best unigram-based criterion 
([1gr|lemma|ordered|all])  is  definitely  less 
accurate   than   the   best   bigram-based  criterion


([2gr|lemma|leftright|all]). However, in practice, 
bigrams and trigrams are seldom used alone. When 
used, they are taken in conjunction with unigrams 
which are supposed to convey the most reliable 
piece of information.
  Why does the criterion [2gr|lemma|leftright|all] 
work so well? First, since this criterion is a 
juxtaposition of lemmas, among the features 
generated by this criterion, the left and the right 
unigrams are to be found, even if these unigrams 
are  disguised as  bigrams (cf.  section 3.4.2). As 
these pieces of contextual evidence are certainly 
the most important ones (cf. section 3.4), it makes 
sense that this bigram-based criterion obtains good 
results.
  Second, in a context of a higher size, the 
juxtaposition of two words seems more relevant 
than one isolated word. For example, to 
disambiguate the word utile, the bigram pour_le is 
relevant, whereas the single unigrams pour and le 
are not of much help.
  Lastly, sometimes, the presence of a unigram 
noncontiguous to the target word can be sufficient 
to solve the ambiguity. But using bigram-based 
criteria does not necessarily lose the piece of 
information conveyed by unigram-based criteria. 
For example, a determiner, a preposition or an 
apostrophe often precedes a common noun. The 
lemmatisation variability of this determiner, this 
preposition or this apostrophe is low for a given 
common noun located at a given distance from a 
given target word. Therefore, the piece of 
information brought out by the juxtaposition of the 
noun and the preceding word is often very similar 
to the piece of information provided by the noun 
alone.

4     Conclusion

  We   have   described   here   the   results   of   a 
systematic and in-depth research on WSD criteria. 
This may be the first research of this extent carried 
out within a unified framework. This study enabled 
us to confirm certain results stated in the field 
literature such as:
• importance of short contexts;
• importance  of  adjacent  noun  or  adverb  for 
adjective disambiguation;
• importance of adjacent adjective, or noun in a 
very short context for noun disambiguation;
• importance of the noun in the area after the verb 
and use of dissymmetrical contexts for verb 
disambiguation.
We have also obtained more original results, not 
always in line with some practices in the field such 
as:


• importance  of   stop-words  whose  withdrawal 
decreases the performance almost systematically;
• better results obtained by bigrams taken alone 
than unigrams alone;
• unnecessary   constraint   of   including   or   be 
adjacent to the target word.
  Disambiguation accuracy could probably be 
improved by the study of other sources of 
information useful in disambiguation, such as:
• criteria based on binary syntactic relations (noun- 
noun, noun-verb, adjective-noun, etc.) to capture 
information which can be absent from short 
contexts;
• the   use   of   thesauri   or   other   sources   of 
information to carry out generalizations on 
context words to overcome data sparseness 
problem;
• topical text information;
• selectional restrictions.
  This preliminary study focuses on homogenous 
criteria (for example: lemmas located from –2 to
+2 position). To improve the disambiguation 
accuracy,  we  have  to  look  for  heterogeneous 
criteria by gathering the most relevant pieces of 
contextual evidence not necessarily of the same
type (for example: lemma in position –2, part-of-
speech  in  position  –1,  morphological  form  of 
target  word  and  lemma  in  position  +2).  This 
feature selection leads to a combinatorial explosion 
that can be solved by genetic algorithms 
(Daelemans, Hoste, Meulder, Naudts, 2003).
