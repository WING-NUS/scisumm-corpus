Abstract

This paper compares a deep and a shallow 
processing approach to the problem of clas- 
sifying a sentence as grammatically well- 
formed or ill-formed.  The deep processing 
approach uses the XLE LFG parser and En- 
glish grammar: two versions are presented, 
one which uses the XLE directly to perform 
the classification, and another one which 
uses a decision tree trained on features con- 
sisting of the XLE’s output statistics.  The 
shallow processing approach predicts gram- 
maticality based on n-gram frequency statis- 
tics:  we present two versions, one which 
uses frequency thresholds and one which 
uses a decision tree trained on the frequen- 
cies of the rarest n-grams in the input sen- 
tence. We find that the use of a decision tree 
improves on the basic approach only for the 
deep parser-based approach. We also show 
that combining both the shallow and deep 
decision tree features is effective. Our eval- 
uation is carried out using a large test set of 
grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. 
The ungrammatical test set is generated au- 
tomatically by inserting grammatical errors 
into well-formed BNC sentences.

grammaticality judgements has uses in the areas of 
computer-assisted language learning and grammar 
checking. Comparative evaluation of existing error 
detection approaches has been hampered by a lack 
of large and commonly used evaluation error cor- 
pora. We attempt to overcome this by automatically 
creating a large error corpus, containing four dif- 
ferent types of frequently occurring grammatical er- 
rors. We use this corpus to evaluate the performance 
of two approaches to the task of automatic error de- 
tection. One approach uses low-level detection tech- 
niques based on POS n-grams. The other approach 
is a novel parser-based method which employs deep 
linguistic processing to discriminate grammatical in- 
put from ungrammatical. For both approaches, we 
implement a basic solution, and then attempt to im- 
prove upon this solution using a decision tree clas- 
sifier. We show that combining both  methods im- 
proves upon the individual methods.
  N-gram-based approaches to the problem of error 
detection have been proposed and implemented in 
various forms by Atwell(1987), Bigert and Knutsson 
(2002), and Chodorow and Leacock (2000) amongst 
others.  Existing approaches are hard to compare 
since they are evaluated on different test sets which 
vary in size and error density. Furthermore, most of 
these approaches concentrate on one type of gram- 
matical error only, namely, context-sensitive or real- 
word spelling errors.  We implement a vanilla n- 
gram-based approach which is tested on a very large 
test set containing four different types of error.
  The idea behind the parser-based approach to er- 
ror detection is to use a broad-coverage hand-crafted 
precision grammar to  detect  ungrammatical sen-

tences.  This approach exploits the fact that a pre- 
cision grammar is designed, in the traditional gen- 
erative grammar sense (Chomsky, 1957), to dis- 
tinguish grammatical sentences from ungrammati- 
cal sentences. This is in contrast to treebank-based 
grammars which tend to massively overgenerate and 
do not generally aim to discriminate between the 
two. In order for our approach to work, the coverage 
of the precision grammars must be broad enough to 
parse a large corpus of grammatical sentences, and 
for this reason, we choose the XLE (Maxwell and 
Kaplan, 1996), an efficient and robust parsing sys- 
tem for Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan 
and Bresnan, 1982) and the ParGram English gram- 
mar (Butt et al., 2002) for our experiments. This sys- 
tem employs robustness techniques, some borrowed 
from Optimality Theory (OT) (Prince and Smolen- 
sky, 1993), to parse extra-grammatical input (Frank 
et al., 1998), but crucially still distinguishes between 
optimal and suboptimal solutions.
  The evaluation corpus is a subset of an un- 
grammatical version of the British National Cor- 
pus (BNC), a 100 million word balanced corpus of 
British English (Burnard, 2000). This corpus is ob- 
tained by automatically inserting grammatical errors 
into the original BNC sentences based on an analysis 
of a manually compiled “real” error corpus.
  This paper makes the following contributions to 
the task of automatic error detection:

1. A novel deep processing XLE-based approach
2. An effective and novel application of decision 
tree machine learning to both shallow and deep 
approaches
3. A novel combination of deep and shallow pro- 
cessing
4. An evaluation of an n-gram-based approach on 
a wider variety of errors than has previously 
been carried out
5. A large evaluation error corpus

  The paper is organised as follows: in Section 2, 
we describe previous approaches to the problem of 
error detection; in Section 3, a description of the 
error corpus used in our evaluation experiments is 
presented, and in Section 4, the two approaches to 
error detection are presented, evaluated, combined


and compared.  Section 5 provides a summary and 
suggestions for future work.

2   Background

2.1   Precision Grammars

A precision grammar is a formal grammar designed 
to distinguish ungrammatical from grammatical sen- 
tences. This is in contrast to large treebank-induced 
grammars which often accept ungrammatical input 
(Charniak, 1996). While high coverage is required, 
it is difficult to increase coverage without also in- 
creasing the amount of ungrammatical sentences 
that are accepted as grammatical by the grammar. 
Most publications in grammar-based automatic error 
detection focus on locating and categorising errors 
and giving feedback. Existing grammars are re-used 
(Vandeventer Faltin, 2003), or grammars of limited 
size are developed from scratch (Reuer, 2003).
  The ParGram English LFG is a hand-crafted 
broad-coverage grammar developed over several 
years with the XLE platform (Butt et al., 2002). The 
XLE parser uses OT to resolve ambiguities (Prince 
and Smolensky, 1993).   Grammar constraints re- 
sulting in rare constructions can be marked as “dis- 
preferred” and constraints resulting in common un- 
grammatical constructions can be marked as “un- 
grammatical”.  The use of constraint ordering and 
marking increases the robustness of the grammar, 
while maintaining the grammatical / ungrammati- 
cal distinction (Frank et al., 1998).  The English 
Resource Grammar (ERG) is a precision Head- 
Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) of En- 
glish (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000; Pollard and 
Sag, 1994). Its coverage is not as broad as the XLE 
English grammar. Baldwin et al. (2004) propose a 
method to identify gaps in the grammar.  Blunsom 
and Baldwin (2006) report ongoing development.
  There has been previous work using the ERG and 
the XLE grammars in the area of computer-assisted 
language learning.  Bender et al.  (2004) use a ver- 
sion of the ERG containing mal-rules to parse ill- 
formed sentences from the SST corpus of Japanese 
learner English (Emi et al., 2004).  They then use 
the semantic representations of the ill-formed input 
to generate well-formed corrections.  Khader et al. 
(2004) study whether the ParGram English LFG can 
be used for computer-assisted language learning by


adding additional OT marks for ungrammatical con- 
structions observed in a learner corpus.  However, 
the evaluation is preliminary, on only 50 test items.

2.2   N-gram Methods

Most shallow approaches to grammar error detection 
originate from the area of real-word spelling error 
correction. A real-word spelling error is a spelling 
or typing error which results in a token which is an- 
other valid word of the language in question.
  The (to our knowledge) oldest work in this area 
is that of Atwell (1987) who uses a POS tagger to 
flag POS bigrams that are unlikely according to a 
reference corpus.  While he speculates that the bi- 
gram frequency should be compared to how often 
the same POS bigram is involved in errors in an error 
corpus, the proposed system uses the raw frequency 
with an empirically established threshold to decide 
whether a bigram indicates an error.  In the same 
paper, a completely different approach is presented 
that uses the same POS tagger to consider spelling 
variants that have a different POS. In the example 
sentence I am very hit the POS of the spelling vari- 
ant hot/JJ is added to the list NN-VB-VBD-VBN of 
possible POS tags of hit. If the POS tagger chooses 
hit/JJ, the word is flagged and the correction hot is 
proposed to the user. Unlike most n-gram-based ap- 
proaches, Atwell’s work aims to detect grammar er- 
rors in general and not just real-word spelling errors. 
However, a complete evaluation is missing.
  The idea of disambiguating between the elements 
of confusion sets is related to word sense disam- 
biguation. Golding (1995) builds a classifier based 
on a rich set of context features. Mays et al. (1991) 
apply the noisy channel model to the disambiguation
problem.  For each candidate correction S′ of the
input S the probability P (S′)P (S|S′) is calculated
and the most likely correction selected. This method
is re-evaluated by Wilcox-O’Hearn et al. (2006) on
WSJ data with artificial real-word spelling errors.
  Bigert and Knutsson (2002) extend upon a basic 
n-gram approach by attempting to match n-grams of 
low frequency with similar n-grams in order to re- 
duce overflagging.  Furthermore, n-grams crossing 
clause boundaries are not flagged and the similarity 
measure is adapted in the case of phrase boundaries 
that usually result in low frequency n-grams.
Chodorow and Leacock (2000) use a mutual in-


formation measure in addition to raw frequency of n- 
grams. Apart from this, their ALEK system employs 
other extensions to the basic approach, for exam- 
ple frequency counts from both generic and word- 
specific corpora are used in the measures. It is not 
reported how much each of these contribute to the 
overall performance.
  Rather than trying to implement all of the pre- 
vious n-gram approaches, we implement the basic 
approach which uses rare n-grams to predict gram- 
maticality.  This property is shared by all previous 
shallow approaches. We also test our approach on a 
wider class of grammatical errors.

3   Ungrammatical Data

In this section, we discuss the notion of an artifi- 
cial error corpus (Section 3.1), define the type of 
ungrammatical language we are dealing with (Sec- 
tion 3.2), and describe our procedure for creating a 
large artificial error corpus derived from the BNC 
(Section 3.3).

3.1   An Artificial Error Corpus

In order to meaningfully evaluate a shallow ver- 
sus deep approach to automatic error detection, a 
large test set of ungrammatical sentences is needed. 
A corpus of ungrammatical sentences can take the 
form of a learner corpus (Granger, 1993; Emi et al.,
2004), i. e. a corpus of sentences produced by lan- 
guage learners, or it can take the form of a more gen- 
eral error corpus comprising sentences which are not 
necessarily produced in a language-learning context 
and which contain competence and performance er- 
rors produced by native and non-native speakers of 
the language (Becker et al., 1999; Foster and Vogel,
2004; Foster, 2005). For both types of error corpus, 
it is not enough to collect a large set of sentences 
which are likely to contain an error - it is also neces- 
sary to examine each sentence in order to determine 
whether an error has actually occurred, and, if it has, 
to note the nature of the error.  Thus, like the cre- 
ation of a treebank, the creation of a corpus of un- 
grammatical sentences requires time and linguistic 
knowledge, and is by no means a trivial task.
  A corpus of ungrammatical sentences which is 
large enough to be useful can be created auto- 
matically by inserting, deleting or replacing words


in grammatical sentences.  These transformations 
should be linguistically realistic and should, there- 
fore, be based on an analysis of naturally produced 
grammatical errors.  Automatically generated error 
corpora have been used before in natural language 
processing.  Bigert (2004) and Wilcox-O’Hearn et 
al.   (2006), for example, automatically introduce 
spelling errors into texts. Here, we generate a large 
error corpus by automatically inserting four different 
kinds of grammatical errors into BNC sentences.

3.2   Commonly Produced Grammatical Errors

Following Foster (2005), we define a sentence to be 
ungrammatical if all the words in the sentence are 
well-formed words of the language in question, but 
the sentence contains one or more error.  This er- 
ror can take the form of a performance slip which 
can occur due to carelessness or tiredness, or a com- 
petence error which occurs due to a lack of knowl- 
edge of a particular construction. This definition in- 
cludes real-word spelling errors and excludes non- 
word spelling errors.  It also excludes the abbrevi- 
ated informal language used in electronic communi- 
cation.  Using the above definition as a guideline, a
20,000 word corpus of ungrammatical English sen- 
tences was collected from a variety of written texts 
including newspapers, academic papers, emails and 
website forums (Foster and Vogel,  2004;  Foster,
2005). The errors in the corpus were carefully anal- 
ysed and classified in terms of how they might be 
corrected using the three word-level correction op- 
erators: insert, delete and substitute. The following 
frequency ordering of the three word-level correc- 
tion operators was found:
substitute (48%) > insert (24%) > delete (17%) >
combination (11%)
Stemberger (1982) reports the same ordering of the 
substitution, deletion and insertion correction oper- 
ators in a study of native speaker spoken language 
slips. Among the grammatical errors which can be 
corrected by substituting one word for another, the 
most common errors are real-word spelling errors 
and agreement errors. In fact, 72% of all errors fall 
into one of the following four classes:

1. missing word errors:
What are the subjects? > What the subjects?
2. extra word errors:


Was that in the summer? > Was that in the sum- 
mer in?
3. real-word spelling errors:
She could not comprehend.  > She could no
comprehend.
4. agreement errors:
She steered Melissa round a corner.   > She 
steered Melissa round a corners.

A similar classification was adopted by Nicholls 
(1999), having analysed the errors in a learner cor- 
pus. Our research is currently limited to the four er- 
ror types given above, i. e. missing word errors, ex- 
tra word errors, real-word spelling errors and agree- 
ments errors. However, it is possible for it to be ex- 
tended to handle a wider class of errors.

3.3   Automatic Error Creation

The error creation procedure takes as input a part- 
of-speech-tagged corpus of sentences which are as- 
sumed to be well-formed, and outputs a corpus of 
ungrammatical sentences. The automatically intro- 
duced errors take the form of the four most com- 
mon error types found in the manually created cor- 
pus, i. e. missing word errors, extra word errors, real- 
word spelling errors and agreement errors. For each 
sentence in the original tagged corpus, an attempt is 
made to automatically produce four ungrammatical 
sentences, one for each of the four error types. Thus, 
the output of the error creation procedure is, in fact, 
four error corpora.

3.3.1   Missing Word Errors
  In the manually created error corpus of Foster 
(2005), missing word errors are classified based on 
the part-of-speech (POS) of the missing word. 98% 
of the missing parts-of-speech come from the fol- 
lowing list (the frequency distribution in the error 
corpus is given in brackets):
det (28%) > verb (23%) > prep (21%) > pro (10%)
> noun (7%) > “to” (7%) > conj (2%)
We use this information when introducing missing 
word errors into the BNC sentences. For each sen- 
tence, all words with the above POS tags are noted. 
One of these is selected and deleted.  The above 
frequency ordering is respected so that, for exam- 
ple, missing determiner errors are produced more of- 
ten than missing pronoun errors. No ungrammatical


sentence is produced if the original sentence con- 
tains just one word or if the sentence contains no 
words with parts-of-speech in the above list.

3.3.2   Extra Word Errors
  We introduce extra word errors in the following 
three ways:

1. Random duplication of any token within a sen- 
tence: That’s the way we we learn here.
2. Random duplication of any POS within a sen- 
tence: There it he was.
3. Random insertion of an arbitrary token into the 
sentence: Joanna drew as a long breadth.

Apart from the case of duplicate tokens, the extra 
words are selected from a list of tagged words com- 
piled from a random subset of the BNC. Again, our 
procedure for inserting extra words is based on the 
analysis of extra word errors in the 20,000 word er- 
ror corpus of Foster (2005).

3.3.3   Real-Word Spelling Errors
  We classify an error as a real-word spelling er- 
ror if it can be corrected by replacing the erroneous 
word with another word with a Levenshtein distance 
of one from the erroneous word, e.g.  the and they. 
Based on the analysis of the manually created er- 
ror corpus (Foster, 2005), we compile a list of com- 
mon English real-word spelling error word pairs. 
For each BNC sentence, the error creation proce- 
dure records all tokens in the sentence which appear 
as one half of one of these word pairs.  One token 
is selected at random and replaced by the other half 
of the pair.  The list of common real-word spelling 
error pairs contains such frequently occurring words 
as is and a, and the procedure therefore produces an 
ill-formed sentence for most input sentences.

3.3.4   Agreement Errors
  We introduce subject-verb and determiner-noun 
number agreement errors into the BNC sentences. 
We consider both types of agreement error equally 
likely and introduce the error by replacing a singular 
determiner, noun or verb with its plural counterpart, 
or vice versa.  For English, subject-verb agreement 
errors can only be introduced for present tense verbs, 
and determiner-noun agreement errors can only be 
introduced for determiners which are marked for


number, e.g.  demonstratives and the indefinite ar- 
ticle.  The procedure would be more productive if 
applied to a morphologically richer language.

3.3.5   Covert Errors
  James (1998) uses the term covert error to de- 
scribe a genuine language error which results in a 
sentence which is syntactically well-formed under 
some interpretation different from the intended one. 
The prominence of covert errors in our automati- 
cally created error corpus is estimated by manually 
inspecting 100 sentences of each error type. The per- 
centage of grammatical structures that are inadver- 
tently produced for each error type and an example 
of each one are shown below:
• Agreement Errors, 7%
Mary’s staff include Jones,Smith and Murphy
> Mary’s staff includes Jones,Smith and Mur- 
phy
• Real-Word Spelling Errors, 10%
And then? > And them?
• Extra Word Errors, 5%
in defiance of the free rider prediction > in de-
fiance of the free rider near prediction
• Missing Word Errors, 13%
She steered Melissa round a corner  > She
steered round a corner

  The occurrence of these covert errors can be re- 
duced by fine-tuning the error creation procedure but 
they can never be completely eliminated.  Indeed, 
they should not be eliminated from the test data, 
because, ideally, an optimal error detection system 
should be sophisticated enough to flag syntactically 
well-formed sentences containing covert errors as 
potentially ill-formed.1

4   Error Detection Evaluation

In this section we present the error detection eval- 
uation experiments.  The experimental setup is ex- 
plained in Section 4.1, the results are presented in 
Section 4.2 and they are analysed in Section 4.3.

  1 An example of this is given in the XLE User Documen- 
tation (http://www2.parc.com/isl/groups/nltt/ 
xle/doc/). The authors remark that an ungrammatical read- 
ing of the sentence Lets go to the store in which Lets is missing 
an apostrophe, is preferable to the grammatical yet implausible 
analysis in which Lets is a plural noun.



4.1	Experimental Setup

4.1.1	Test Data and Evaluation Procedure
  The following steps are carried out to produce 
training and test data for this experiment:

1. Speech material, poems, captions and list items 
are removed from the BNC. 4.2 million sen- 
tences remain.  The order of sentences is ran- 
domised.
2. For the purpose of cross-validation, the corpus 
is split into 10 parts.
3. Each part is passed to the 4 automatic error in- 
sertion modules described in Section 3.3, re- 
sulting in 40 additional sets of varying size.
4. The first 60,000 sentences of each of the 50 
sets, i. e. 3 million sentences, are parsed with 
XLE.2
5. N-gram frequency information is extracted for 
the first 60,000 sentences of each set. An addi- 
tional 20,000 is extracted as held-out data.
6. 10 sets with mixed error types are produced by 
joining a quarter of each respective error set.
7. For each error type (including mixed errors) 
and cross-validation set, the 60,000 grammat- 
ical and 60,000 ungrammatical sentences are 
joined.
8. Each cross-validation run uses one set out of 
the 10 as test data (120,000 sentences) and the 
remaining 9 sets for training (1,080,000 sen- 
tences).

  The experiment is a standard binary classification 
task. The methods classify the sentences of the test 
sets as grammatical or ungrammatical. We use the 
standard measures of precision, recall, f-score and 
accuracy (Figure 1).  True positives are understood 
to be ungrammatical sentences that are identified as 
such.  The baseline precision and accuracy is 50% 
as half of the test data is ungrammatical.  If 100% 
of the test data is classified as ungrammatical, re- 
call will be 100% and f-score 2/3.   Recall shows 
the accuracy we would get if the grammatical half 
of the test data was removed. Parametrised methods

  2 We  use  the  XLE  command  parse-testfile with  parse- 
literally set to 1, max xle scratch storage set to 1,000 MB, time- 
out to 60 seconds, and the XLE English LFG. Skimming is not 
switched on and fragments are.

are first optimised for accuracy and then the other 
measures are taken.  Therefore, f-scores below the 
artificial 2/3 baseline are meaningful.

4.1.2   Method 1: Precision Grammar
  According to the XLE documentation, a sentence 
is marked with a star (*) if its optimal solution uses 
a constraint marked as ungrammatical. We use this 
star feature, parser exceptions and zero number of 
parses to classify a sentence as ungrammatical.

4.1.3   Method 2: POS N-grams
  In each cross-validation run, the full data of the 
remaining 9 sets of step 2 of the data generation 
(see Section 4.1.1) is used as a reference corpus of
0.9×4, 200, 000 = 3, 800, 000 assumedly grammat-
ical sentences. The reference corpora and data sets
are POS tagged with the IMS TreeTagger (Schmidt,
1994). Frequencies of POS n-grams (n = 2, . . . , 7) 
are counted in the reference corpora. A test sentence 
is flagged as ungrammatical if it contains an n-gram 
below a fixed frequency threshold.  Method 2 has 
two parameters: n and the frequency threshold.

4.1.4   Method 3: Decision Trees on XLE Output
  The XLE parser outputs additional statistics for 
each sentence that we encode in six features:
• An integer indicating starredness (0 or 1) and 
various parser exceptions (-1 for time out, -2 
for exceeded memory, etc.)
• The number of optimal parses3
• The number of unoptimal parses
• The duration of parsing
• The number of subtrees
• The number of words
    3 The use of preferred versus dispreferred constraints are 
used to distinguish optimal parses from unoptimal ones.



Training data for the decision tree learner is com- 
posed of 9×60, 000 = 540, 000 feature vectors from 
grammatical sentences and 9 × 15, 000 = 135, 000
feature vectors from ungrammatical sentences of 
each error type, resulting in equal amounts of gram- 
matical and ungrammatical training data.
  We choose the weka implementation of machine 
learning algorithms for the experiments (Witten and 
Frank, 2000).  We use a J48 decision tree learner 
with the default model.

4.1.5   Method 4: Decision Trees on N-grams
  Method 4 follows the setup of Method 3.  How- 
ever, the features are the frequencies of the rarest 
n-grams (n = 2, . . . , 7) in the sentence.  Therefore, 
the feature vector of one sentence contains 6 num- 
bers.

4.1.6   Method 5: Decision Trees on Combined
Feature Sets
  This method combines the features of Methods 3 
and 4 for training a decision tree.

4.2   Results

Table 1 shows the results for Method 1, which uses 
XLE starredness, parser exceptions4 and zero parses 
to classify grammaticality.  Table 2 shows the re- 
sults for Method 2, the basic n-gram approach. Ta- 
ble 3 shows the results for Method 3, which classi- 
fies based on a decision tree of XLE features. The 
results for Method 4, the n-gram-based decision tree 
approach, are shown in Table 4.  Finally, Table 5 
shows the results for Method 5 which combines n- 
gram and XLE features in decision trees.
  In the case of Method 2, we first have to find opti- 
mal parameters. As only very limited integer values 
for n and the threshold are reasonable, an exhaustive 
search is feasible. We considered n = 2, . . . , 7 and 
frequency thresholds below 20,000. Separate held- 
out data (400,000 sentences) is used in order to avoid 
overfitting. Best accuracy is achieved with 5-grams 
and a threshold of 4.  Table 2 reports results with 
these parameters.

  4 XLE parsing (see footnote 2 for configuration) runs out 
of time for 0.7 % and out of memory for 2.5 % of sentences, 
measured on training data of the first cross-validation run, i. e.
540,000 grammatical sentence and 135,000 of each error type.
14 sentences of 3 million caused the parser to terminate abnor- 
mally.

Table 2: Classification results with 5-gram and fre- 
quency threshold 4 (Method 2)


  The standard deviation of results across cross- 
validation runs is below 0.006 on all measures, ex- 
cept for Method 4. Therefore we only report average 
percentages.  The highest observed standard devia- 
tion is 0.0257 for recall of Method 4 on agreement 
errors.
  For Methods 3, 4 and 5, the decision tree learner 
optimises accuracy and, in doing so, chooses a trade- 
off between precision and recall.

4.3   Analysis
Both Method 1 (Table 1) and Method 2 (Table 2) 
achieve above baseline accuracy for all error types. 
However, Method 1, which uses the XLE starred 
feature, parser exceptions and zero parses to de- 
termine whether or not a sentence is grammatical, 
slightly outperforms Method 2, which uses the fre-

Table 5: Classification results with decision tree on 
joined feature set (Method 5)



quency of POS 5-grams to detect an error.  The 
XLE deep-processing approach is better than the n- 
gram-based approach for agreement errors (f-score
+10.4).    Examining the  various  types  of  agree- 
ment errors, we can see that this is especially the 
case for singular subjects followed by plural cop- 
ula verbs (recall +37.7) and determiner-noun num- 
ber mismatches (recall +23.6 for singular nouns and
+18.0 for plural nouns), but not for plural subjects 
followed by singular verbs (recall -24.0). The rela- 
tively poor performance of Method 2 on agreement 
errors involving determiners could be due to the lack 
of agreement marking on the Penn Treebank deter- 
miner tag used by TreeTagger.
  Method 1 is outperformed by Method 2 for real- 
word spelling and extra word errors (f-score -4.2,
-4.0).  Unsurprisingly, Method 2 has an advantage 
on those real-word spelling errors that change the 
POS (recall -8.8 for Method 1). Both methods per- 
form poorly on missing word errors. For both meth- 
ods there are only very small differences in perfor- 
mance between the various missing word error sub- 
types (identified by the POS of the deleted word).
  Method 3, which uses machine learning to exploit 
all the information returned by the XLE parser, im- 
proves performance from Method 1, the basic XLE


method, for all error types.5   The general improve- 
ment comes from an improvement in recall, mean- 
ing that more ungrammatical sentences are actu- 
ally flagged as such without compromising preci- 
sion.  The improvement is highest for agreement 
errors (f-score +7.2).  Singular subject with plural 
copula errors (e. g. The man are) peak at a recall of
91.0. The Method 3 results indicate that information 
on the number of solutions (optimal and unoptimal), 
the number of subtrees, the time taken to parse the 
sentence and the number of words can be used to 
predict grammaticality.  It would be interesting to 
investigate this approach with other parsers.
  Method 4, which uses a decision tree with n- 
gram-based features, confirms the results of Method
2. The decision trees’ root nodes are similar or even 
identical (depending on cross-validation run) to the 
decision rule of Method 2 (5-gram frequency below
4).   However, the 10 decision trees have between
1,111 and 1,905 nodes and draw from all features, 
even bigrams and 7-grams that perform poorly on 
their own. The improvements are very small though 
and they are not significant according the criterion of 
non-overlapping cross-validation results. The main 
reason for the evaluation of Method 4 is to provide 
another reference point for comparison of the final 
method.
  The overall best results are those for Method 5, 
the combined XLE, n-gram and machine-learning- 
based method, which outperforms the next best 
method, Method 3, on all error types apart from 
agreement errors (f-score -1.7, +2.7, +3.8, +0.8). 
For agreement errors, it seems that the relatively 
poor results for n-grams have a negative effect on the 
relatively good results for the XLE. Figure 2 shows 
that the performance is almost constant on ungram- 
matical data in the important sentence length range 
from 5 to 40. However, there is a negative correla- 
tion of accuracy and sentence length for grammati- 
cal sentences. Very long sentences of any kind tend 
to be classified as ungrammatical, except for missing 
word errors which remain close to the 50% baseline 
of coin-flipping.
  For all methods, missing word errors are the 
worst-performing, particularly in recall (i. e. the ac-

  5 The +0.3 increase in average accuracy for extra word errors 
is not clearly significant as the results of cross-validation runs 
overlap.


 


Figure 2: Accuracy by sentence length for Method 5 
measured on separate grammatical and ungrammat- 
ical data: Gr = Grammatical, AG = Agreement, RW
= Real-Word, EW = Extra Word, MW = Missing
Word


curacy on ungrammatical data alone).  This means 
that the omission of a word is less likely to result in 
the sentence being flagged as erroneous. In contrast, 
extra word errors perform consistently and relatively 
well for all methods.


5   Conclusion and Future Work


We evaluated a deep processing approach and a POS 
n-gram-based approach to the automatic detection of 
common grammatical errors in a BNC-derived arti- 
ficial error corpus. The results are broken down by 
error type. Together with the deep approach, a deci- 
sion tree machine learning algorithm can be used ef- 
fectively. However, extending the shallow approach 
with the same learning algorithm gives only small 
improvements. Combining the deep and shallow ap- 
proaches gives an additional improvement on all but 
one error type.
  Our plan is to investigate why all methods per- 
form poorly on missing word errors, to extend the 
error creation procedure so that it includes a wider 
range of errors, to try the deep approach with other 
parsers, to integrate additional features from state- 
of-the-art shallow techniques and to repeat the ex- 
periments for languages other than English.
