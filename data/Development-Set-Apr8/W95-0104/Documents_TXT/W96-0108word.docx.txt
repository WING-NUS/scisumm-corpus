Abstract

   This paper  describes an automatic, context-sensitive, word-error  correction system based 
on statistical language modeling (SLM) as applied to optical character recognition (OCR) post­ 
processing. The system exploits information from multiple sources, including  letter n-grams, 
character confusion probabilities, and word-bigram  probabilities.  Letter n-grams are used to 
index the words in the lexicon. Given a sentence to be corrected, the system decomposes each 
string in the sentence into letter n-grams and retrieves word candidates  from the lexicon by 
comparing string n-grams with lexicon-entry n-grams. The retrieved candidates are ranked by 
the conditional probability of matches with the string, given character confusion probabilities. 
Finally, the word-bigram model and Viterbi algorithm  are used to determine  the best scoring 
word sequence for the sentence. The system can correct non-word errors as well as real-word 
errors and achieves a 60.2% error reduction rate for real OCR text. In addition,  the system can 
learn the character  confusion probabilities  for a specific OCR environment and  use them in 
self-calibration to achieve better performance.


1   Introduction

Word errors present problems for various text- or speech-based applications such as optical char­ 
acter recognition (OCR) and voice-input computer interfaces.  In particular, though current OCR 
technology is quite refined and robust, sources such as old books, poor-quality  (nth-generation) 
photocopies, and faxes can still be difficult to process and may cause many OCR errors. For OCR to 
be truly useful in a wide range of applications, such as office automation and information retrieval 
systems, OCR reliability must be improved.  A method for the automatic correction of OCR errors 
would be clearly beneficial.
Essentially, there are two types of word errors:  non-word errors and real-word errors. A non­
word error occurs when a word in a source text is interpreted (under OCR) as a string that does 
not correspond  to any valid word in a given word  list or dictionary.  A real-word error occurs 
when a source-text word is interpreted as a string that actually does occur in the dictionary, but is 
not identical with the source-text word.  For example, if the source text "John found the man" is 
rendered as "John fomd he man" by an OCR device, then "fomd" is a non-word  error and "he" is 
a real-word error. In general, non-word errors will never correspond to any dictionary entries and


will include wildly incorrect strings (such as"#


&&") as well as misrecognized alpha-numeric


sequences (such as "BN234" for "8N234"). However, some non-word  errors might become real­ 
word errors if the size of the word list or dictionary increases.  (For example, the word "ruel"1 
might count as a non-word  error for the source-text word "rut"  if a small dictionary is used for 
reference, but count as a real-word error if an unabridged  dictionary is used.)  While non-word 
errors might be corrected without considering  the context in which the error occurs, a real-word 
error can only be corrected by taking context into account.
   The problems of word-error  detection and correction have been studied  for several decades. 
A good  survey  in this area can be found  in [Kukich 1992].  Most traditional  word-correction
techniques concentrate on non-word error correction and do not consider the context in which the 
error appears.
   Recently, statistical language models (SLMs) and feature-based  methods have been used for 
context-sensitive spelling-error correction.  For example, Atwell and Elliittm [1987] have used a 
part-of-speech (POS) tagging method to detect the real-word errors in text. Mays and colleagues 
[1991] have exploited word trigrams to detect and correct both the non-word and real-word errors 
that were artificially generated from 100 sentences. Church and Gale [1991] have used a Bayesian 
classifier method  to improve the performance for non-word error correction. Golding [1995] has 
applied a hybrid Bayesian method for real-word error correction and Golding and Schabes [1996] 
have combined a POS trigram and Bayesian methods for the same purpose.
The goal of the work described here is to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of SLM­
based methods applied to the problem of OCR error correction. Since POS-based methods are not 
effective in distinguishing  among candidates with the same POS tags and since methods based on 
word-trigram models involve extensive training data and require that huge word-trigram tables 
be available at run time, we used a word-bigram SLM as the first step in our investigation.
In this paper, we describe a system that uses a word-bigram SLM technique to correct OCR
errors.   The system  takes advantage  of information  from multiple  sources, including  letter n­ 
grams, character confusion probabilities, and word bigram probabilities, to effect context-based 
word error correction. It can correct non-word as well as real-word errors. In addition, the system 
can learn the character confusion probability table for a specific OCR environment  and use it to 
achieve better performance.


2   The Approach

2.1   Problem Statement

The problem of context-based OCR word-error correction can be stated as follows:
   Let L = { w 1, w2 , ••• , wm} be the set of all the words in a given lexicon. For an input sentence, 
S  = s 1 , •••,sn, produced  as the output  of an OCR device, where  s 1 , •••,sn  are character strings 
separated  by spaces, find the best word sequence, vV = wb '11'2, ••• , Wn, for W; E L, that maximizes 
the probability pr(lVjS):

                                                                     (1)





1"Ruel" is an obscure French-derivative word meaning the space between a bed and the wall.


Using Bayes' formula, we can rewrite 1as:

argmaxw(pr(WIS))
pr(W)  * pr(SIW))
argmaxw (	pr(S)
argmaxw(pr(W) * pr(SIW)) 	(2)

The probability  pr(W) is given by the language model and can be decomposed  as:
n


pr(W) 	=	IIpr(w;lw1,i-1)
i=1


(3)



wherepr( w;jw1,;_1) is the probability thattheword w; appears given thatw1, w2 , ••• , w;_1 appeared 
previously.
   In a word-bigram language model, we assume that the probability that a word  w; will appear 
is affected only by the immediately preceding word. Thus,

(4)



and




n
pr
(
W
) 
= 
IT
pr
( 
w;
jw
;-
1)
i
=
1





(5)



   The conditional  probability,  pr(SIW), reflects the channel  (processing) characteristics of the 
OCR environment.   If we assume  that  strings  produced  under  OCR are independent of one 
another, we have the following formula:


n
pr(SIW)  = ITpr(s;lw;)
i=l

So, 	w 	argmaxw(pr(W)  * pr(SIW))
n
argmaxw(ITpr( w;jw;-1) * pr(s;lw;))
i=l



(6)





(7)



Thus, the problem of calculatingW  is reduced to estimating the word-bigram probability, pr( w; lw;_1), 
and the word confusion probability, pr( s; Iw;).  The word-bigram  probability, pr( w; Iw;-1), can be 
estimated by a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE):

prML  ( 	I	) = c( wi-ll w;)


W; Wi-1


c(wi-1)


where c( w;_1) is the number of times that wi_1 occurs in the text and c( wi-ll wi) is the number of 
times that the word bignim (wi-ll w;) occurs in the text.
However, the estimatation  of unseen bigrams is a problem.  We use a back-off model similar to
that described in [Dagan & Pereira 1994] to estimate the word-bigram probabilities in our system.
  If we already have estimates of the probabilities  pr( w;lw;-1) and  pr( s;jw;), the Viterbi algo­ 
rithm [Chamiak 1993] could be used to determine the best word sequence for the given sentence. 
Details of the back-off  model and Viterbi algorithm  can be found  in [Dagan & Pereira 1994]  and 
[Charniak 1993].



2.2   Estimate of Channel Probabilities and Learning of Character Confusion Table

The probability  pr( slw )-the conditional probability that, given a word w, it is recognized by the 
OCR software as the string s-can be estimated by the confusion probabilities of the characters in 
s if we assume that character recognition in OCR is an independent process.
We assume  that an OCR string  is generated  from the original word  by one or more of the
following operations:  (a) delete a character; (b) insert a character; or (c) substitute  one character 
for another. Under such circumstances, a dynamic programming method can be used to determine 
the operations that maximize the conditional probability when transforming the original word to 
the OCR string, given a character confusion probability table.
   Let t 1 ,t 2 ••• t; be the first i characters of the string that is produced  by the OCR process for 
a source word  s and let s1 , s2 ••• si be the first  j actual characters of s.  Define pr( ilj)  to be the 
conditional probability  that the substring  s1,i is recognized as substring h,; by the OCR process, 
i.e., pr(t 1 ,;is 1 ,j)· The dynamic programming  recurrence is given as follows:
pr(i- llj)  * pr(ins(t;))


pr(ilj) =max


pr(ilj- 1) * pr(del(si)lsi)
pr(i- llj- 1)  * pr(t;lsi)


(8)



where 	pr( ins(y)) is the probability that letter y is inserted.
pr(del(y)IY) is the probability that letter y is deleted.
pr(xly) is the probability that letter y is replaced by letter x.

   For example, suppose  that source word "flag" is recognized as "flo" by an OCR device.  For­ 
mula 8 may determine that a sequence of four operations-(!}substitute "f" for "f"; (2) substitute 
"1" for "1"; (3) substitute  "a" for "o", and (4) delete "g"-maximizes the conditional probability 
pr("flo"l"flag"). Then the probability of "flag" being rendered as "flo" can be estimated as:
pr("flo"l"flag") = pr("f"l"f") * pr("l"l"l") * pr("o"l"a")  * pr(del("g")l"g")
   This method is similar to what was described in [Wagner 1974] where the minimum edit distance 
between two strings was computed.  The minimum edit distance is the minimum number of oper­ 
ations that transform the source string to the target string.  Note that to effect spelling correction, 
we could include character transposition probabilities.
If we have no information  about the character confusion probabilities, we can estimate them
as:




pr(ylx) 	{


a	ify=x
1-;t	otherwise



(9)



pr( del( x )lx)



=   pr(ins(x)) =


1-a



(10)



where N is the total number of printable characters.
The estimator a can be regarded as the probability that a given character is correctly recognized.
Our experiments show that system performance is very sensitive to the value of a, especially for 
real-word error correction.  For example, if a is very high, then the probability  pr( sis) will be too 
high to be affected by subsequent  processing and will not be changed.  On the other hand if a is 
very low, some correct words may be detected as real-word errors and will be changed.
If we have both the original text and the corresponding OCR output and if we assume that the
errors made by a particular OCR system are not random (but semi-deterministic), we can count the


cases of substitution,  deletion, and insertion using a method similar to computing  the minimum 
edit distance between strings [Wagner 1974] and we can estimate the probabilities using formulas 
similar to those in [Church & Gale 1991]:



pr(ylx)

   Obviously, in practice, we typically do not have the original text to compare to the OCR text or 
to use for correction. Moreover, as noted in [Liu et al. 1991], the character confusion characteristics 
are heavily dependent on the OCR environment, encompassing everything from the performance 
biases of the specific OCR software to the size of characters in the source text, fonts used, individual 
character types, and print quality of the text being processed. It is not feasible to train on texts to 
acquire character confusion probabilities for each OCR environment.
The current system employs an iterative learning1rom-correcting technique that treats the cor­
rected OCR text as an approximation  of the original  text.   The system starts  by assuming  all 
characters  are equally  likely to be misrecognized  (with some uniform,  small  probability)  and 
learns the character confusion probabilities by comparing the OCR text to the corrected OCR text 
after each pass.  Then the learned character confusion probabilities are used for the next pass 
processing (feedback processing).  This method  proves to be quite effective in improving  system 
performance.


2.3   Generation  of Word Candidates for a Given String

Ideally, each word, w, in the lexicon should be compared to a given OCR string, s, to compute the 
conditional probability, pr( wls). However, this approach would be computationally too expensive. 
Instead, the system operates in two steps, first to generate the candidates  and then to specify the 
maximal number of candidates, N, to be considered for the correction of an OCR string.
   In step 1, the system retrieves a large list of word candidates  for a given string.  To nominate 
candidates,  we use a vector space information  retrieval technique [Salton 1989]: all the words in 
the lexicon are indexed by letter n-grams and the (OCR) string, also parsed into letter n-grams, is 
treated as a query over the database of lexicon entries.  In particular, all words  (or OCR strings) 
are indexed by their letter trigrams, including  the 'beginning' and 'end' spaces surrounding the 
string. Words of four or fewer characters are also indexed by their letter bigrams. For example:



"the" 
"example"



=> {#th, the, he#, 
#t, th, he, e#}
=> {#ex, exa, 
xam, mpl, ple, 
le#}



   A given OCR string  to be corrected is represented  by a vector containing  its letter n-grams. 
Using the vector as the query, the lexicon words that are similar to the word error are retrieved, 
giving a large list of candidate correct forms.  Candidates must share at least some features with 
the input string (query).  A ranked list can be generated  by scoring matches using a simple term 
frequency (TF) count-the number of matches between the query vector and then-gram vector of 
a candidate word.  For example, given the string:

"exanple" 	=> {#exanple#}
=> {#ex, exa, xan, anp, npl, ple, le#}

the word "example" is a candidate:



"example" 	:::} {#example#}
:::} {#ex, exa, xam, amp, mpl, ple, le#}

Since the two items share four letter n-grams-"#ex", "exa", "ple", and "le#"-the TF score of the 
candidate  word "example" for the input string "exanple" is four. Note also that the TF score can 
be used to establish a threshold or cutoff score to limit the number of candidates  to consider.
   In step 2, the system re-ranks the words in the candidate  list using channel probabilities as 
described above.
On average, the system generates several hundred candidates for a given string. Only the first
N candidates are retained for context-based word-error correction.


2.4   The Word Correction System for OCR Post-Processing

   The lexicon is generated  from the training text; it includes all the words in the training set 
with frequency greater than the preset threshold.  The words in the lexicon are indexed by letter 
n-grams as described in the previous section.


The overall process for correcting a sentence is as follows:

1.  Read a sentence from the input OCR text.

2. Retrieve up  to lv1 candidates  from  the lexicon for each  possible error. 2      Rerank  the  lv1 
candidates by their conditional probabilities to the error. Keep only the top N candidates for 
the next processing step. (In the current system, lv1 is 10,000 and N is 10.)
3. Use the Viterbi algorithm to get the best word sequence for the strings in the sentence. 
Figure 2 illustrates  the alternative choices and the optimal path found during  the processing
(correcting) of the sentence "john fomd he man".

Figure 2: Process of Correcting a Sentence


   The system requires several passes to correct an OCR text.  In the first pass, the system has 
no information  on the character confusion probabilities, so it will assume a prior belief a as the 
probability that a character is correctly recognized. The system distributes the rest of the probability 
uniformly among other events.  (Cf. Formula 9.) In each feedback step, the system first generates 
a character confusion probability table by comparing the OCR text to the corrected OCR text from 
the last pass. It uses the new confusion table for the next-pass correction of the OCR text.




  2 1n its non-word error  mode  of operation, the system treats  every  word  that  does  not  match  a lexicon entry  as a 
possible  error.  In its non-word and  real-word error  mode,  the system treats every  word  as though it were a possible 
error.




3    Experiments and Results

To test our OCR-error-correction process, we used a set of electronic documents from the Ziff-Davis 
(ZIFF) news wire.3   The documents in the corpus are business articles in the domain of computer 
science and computer engineering.  We used 90% of the collection for training and the remaining
10% for testing.
   The system created  a lexicon and collected word-bigram  sequences and  statistics from the 
training  data.    Words or word-bigrams  with  frequency less than  three were discarded.    The 
resulting lexicon contained about 100,000 words; these were indexed using 34,847letter n-grams. 
The resulting word-bigram  table had about 1,000,000 entries.
   Seventy pages of ZIFF data in the test set were printed  in 7-point Times font.  We degraded 
the print quality of the documents  by photocopying  them on a 'light' setting.  The photocopies
were then scanned by a Fujitsu 3097E scanner and the resulting images were processed by Xerox
Textbridge OCR software.
   The set of documents  contained  55,699 strings  and  the overall word  error  rate after OCR 
processing was 22.9% (12,760). For literal words in the source (only letter sequences, not alpha­ 
numeric ones), the error rate was lower, 14.7% (8,198). Table 1 gives the number of real-word and 
non-word errors for literal words in the OCR data.

Table 1: OCR Errors Originating from Literal Words


We conducted  three experiments:

1.  Isolated-Word  Error Correction:  The system used only channel probabilities without consid­ 
ering context information, i.e., it always selected the candidate with the highest rank in the 
candidates list to correct a given OCR string.

2. Context-Dependent Non-Word Error Correction: The system used context to correct strings that 
did match valid lexicon words.

3. Context-Dependent Non- and Real-Word  Error Correction:  The system treated all input strings 
as possible errors and tried to correct them by taking into account the contexts in which the 
strings appeared.

   In each experiment,  the system conducted  four correction passes: one initial pass with prior 
probability a= 0.99 and three feedback passes.
Results are given in Tables 2, 3, and 4.  In all cases, we considered  only those strings whose
correct forms are literal words (not alpha-numerics).   Note that errors can be introduced  by the 
system when it incorrectly changes a correct word in the OCR text into another  word.   In fact, 
we distinguish  two types of errors introduced  by the system: errors caused by changing correct

unknown words and  errors caused  by changing  correct lexicon words. The error  reduction rate 
was calculated by subtracting total errors from 8,198 and dividing by 8,198.
   The system,  running unoptimized code on a 128MHz DECalpha  processor,  processed  the test 
corpus  at a rate of about  200 words (strings)  per second  for experiments 1 and  2; and  30 words 
(strings) per second  for experiment 3.

Table 4: Results from Context-Dependent Real- and Non-Word  Error Correction



4   Analysis

Based on the results, we can see that the predominant, positive effect in correction occurs in the first 
pass.  Performance also improves significantly in the first feedback  process, as the system  learns 
the character confusion probabilities by correcting the OCR text.  The second  and  third  feedback 
steps  have  only  slight  effect on  the error  reduction rates.   Indeed, in experiment 3, the  result 
from the third  feedback pass is actually  worse  than  that from  the second  feedback  pass.  These 
results indicate  that an initial pass followed  by two feedback  passes may optimize the method. In 
the following discussion, we compare the three experiments using  the results  obtained from the 
second  feedback  step (Feedback-2).
As we  might  expect,  the  results  from  the context-based experiments are much  better  than
those  from the isolated-word experiment. The error  reduction rates in experiments 2 and  3 are,



respectively, 10.3% and 17.1% higher than the rate in experiment 1.  This indicates  that even a 
modest (e.g., bigram-based) representation of context is useful in selecting the best candidates for 
word-error correction.
   Inall three experiments, the system introduced 182 new errors due to false corrections of words 
that were not in the lexicon. (Recall that the system lexicon is based on the words derived from the 
training corpus; some words may be present in the test corpus that are not in the training corpus.) 
Whenever the system encounters an unknown word, it treats it as a non-word error and attempts 
to correct it. In such cases, the system replaces the presumed non-word error with a word from its 
lexicon. Thus, for example, if the system encounters  the word "MobileData" (a correct name) in 
the OCR output,  but does not have "MobileData" in its lexicon, it might change "MobileData" to 
"MobileComm" (a word that does exist in the training corpus lexicon). Of course, such problems 
in processing unknown  words are not unique to OCR error correction; they represent a general 
problem for all natural-language processing tasks.
   As shown  by experiment  3, when  the system  uses context-based  non- and  real-word error 
correction, it achieves a total error  reduction  rate of 60.2%.  This is 6.8% higher  than  the rate 
achieved in the context-based non-word experiment.  The improvement  in performance is gained 
principally from the reduction of the real-word errors. Although the system introduces additional 
errors-since all the strings in the OCR text are treated as possible errors and subject to change-the 
number of corrected real-word errors far exceeds the number of real-word errors introduced.  In 
the second feedback pass, for example, the system introduced 141 new errors by changing correct 
lexicon words into other lexicon words. On the other hand, the system properly corrected 684 real 
errors-32.1% of all the real errors.  The corrected OCR text, therefore, has 543 fewer real-word 
errors than the original OCR text.
Certain types of errors in the source or OCR-output text present systematic problems for our
approach, highlighting  the limitations of the system.  In particular, because the process is based 
on the structural  definition of a word (viz., a character sequence 'between  white space')-not  a 
morphological one-any errors that obscure word boundaries will defy correction. For example, 
run-on  errors  (e.g., "of the"/"ofthe") and  split-word  errors  ("training"/"train ng") cannot  be 
corrected.   In addition,  the use of a vector-space querying  to find candidate  lexical entries­ 
including our special approach to word decomposition and scoring an present problems when 
processing some OCR errors, especially short strings.  For example, if "both"  (in the source) is
·rendered as "hotn" (in the OCR text), it is not possible for the system to generate "both" as one of 
the high-ranked candidates-they share only one feature, the bigram "ot"-despite the fact that 
the conditional probability pr("hotn"l"both") might be high. Finally, the system suffers from the 
common limitation of word bigram or trigram models in that it cannot capture discourse properties 
of context, such as topic and tense, which are sometimes required to select the correct word.


5    Conclusion

The system we have created uses information from a variety of sources-letter n-grams, charac­ 
ter confusion probabilities, and word-bigram  probabilities-to realize context-based, automatic, 
word-error correction. It can correct non-word errors as well as real-word errors. The system can 
also learn character confusion probability tables by correcting OCR text and use such information 
to achieve better performance.   Overall, for complete (real- and non-word)  error correction, it 
achieved a 60.2% rate of error reduction.



   The techniques we have used are subject to certain systematic problems. However, we believe 
they  will  prove  to be useful  not  only  in improving the quality  of OCR processing, but  also in 
enhancing a variety of information retrieval  applications.
   In future work, we plan to explore different  heuristics to deal with word  boundary problems 
and  to incorporate other  models  of context  representation, including both SLM approaches, such 
as word  trigram models, and simple  discourse structures.
