Abstract


We present a classification-based word 
prediction  model  based  on  IGTR EE,  a 
decision-tree induction algorithm with fa- 
vorable scaling abilities and a functional 
equivalence to n-gram models with back- 
off smoothing.  Through a first series of 
experiments, in which we train on Reuters 
newswire text and test either on the same 
type of data or on general or fictional text, 
we demonstrate that the system exhibits 
log-linear increases in prediction accuracy 
with increasing numbers of training ex- 
amples.    Trained  on  30  million  words 
of newswire text, prediction accuracies 
range between 12.6% on fictional text and
42.2% on newswire text.  In a second se- 
ries of experiments we compare all-words 
prediction with confusable prediction, i.e., 
the same task, but specialized to predict- 
ing among limited sets of words.  Con- 
fusable prediction yields high accuracies 
on nine example confusable sets in all 
genres of text.  The confusable approach 
outperforms the all-words-prediction ap- 
proach, but with more data the difference 
decreases.


1   Introduction

Word prediction is an intriguing language engineer- 
ing semi-product.  Arguably it is the “archetypical 
prediction problem in natural language processing”


(Even-Zohar and Roth, 2000).  It is usually not an 
engineering end in itself to predict the next word in a 
sequence, or fill in a blanked-out word in a sequence. 
Yet, it could be an asset in higher-level proofing or 
authoring tools, e.g. to be able to automatically dis- 
cern among confusables and thereby to detect con- 
fusable errors (Golding and Roth, 1999; Even-Zohar 
and Roth, 2000; Banko and Brill, 2001; Huang and 
Powers, 2001). It could alleviate problems with low- 
frequency and unknown words in natural language 
processing and information retrieval, by replacing 
them with likely and higher-frequency alternatives 
that carry similar information.  And also, since the 
task of word prediction is a direct interpretation of 
language modeling, a word prediction system could 
provide useful information for to be used in speech 
recognition systems.
  A unique aspect of the word prediction task, as 
compared to most other tasks in natural language 
processing, is that real-world examples abound in 
large amounts.  Any digitized text can be used as 
training material for a word prediction system capa- 
ble of learning from examples, and nowadays gigas- 
cale and terascale document collections are available 
for research purposes.
  A  specific type  of  word  prediction  is  confus- 
able prediction,  i.e.,  learn to predict among lim- 
ited sets of confusable words such as to/two/too and 
there/their/they’re (Golding and Roth, 1999; Banko 
and Brill, 2001).  Having trained a confusable pre- 
dictor on occurrences of words within a confusable 
set, it can be applied to any new occurrence of a 
word from the set; if its prediction based on the con- 
text deviates from the word actually present, then

this word might be a confusable error, and the classi- 
fier’s prediction might be its correction. Confusable 
prediction and correction is a strong asset in proof- 
ing tools.

  In this paper we generalize the word prediction 
task to predicting any word in context. This is basi- 
cally the task of a generic language model. An ex- 
plicit choice for the particular study on “all-words” 
prediction  is  to  encode  context  only  by  words, 
and not by any higher-level linguistic non-terminals 
which have been investigated in related work on 
word prediction (Wu et al., 1999; Even-Zohar and 
Roth, 2000).  This choice leaves open the question 
how the same tasks can be learned from examples 
when non-terminal symbols are taken into account 
as well.

  The choice for our algorithm, a decision-tree ap- 
proximation of k-nearest-neigbor (k-NN) based or 
memory-based learning, is motivated by the fact 
that, as we describe later in this paper, this particular 
algorithm can scale up to predicting tens of thou- 
sands of words, while simultaneously being able to 
scale up to tens of millions of examples as training 
material, predicting words at useful rates of hun- 
dreds to thousands of words per second.  Another 
motivation for our choice is that our decision-tree 
approximation of k-nearest neighbor classification is 
functionally equivalent to back-off smoothing (Za- 
vrel and Daelemans, 1997); not only does it share 
its performance capacities with n-gram models with 
back-off smoothing, it also shares its scaling abili- 
ties with these models, while being able to handle 
large values of n.

  The article is structured as follows. In Section 2 
we describe what data we selected for our experi- 
ments, and we provide an overview of the exper- 
imental methodology used throughout the experi- 
ments, including a description of the IGTR EE algo- 
rithm central to our study. In Section 3 the results of 
the word prediction experiments are presented, and 
the subsequent Section 4 contains the experimen- 
tal results of the experiments on confusables.  We 
briefly relate our work to earlier work that inspired 
the current study in Section 5.  The results are dis- 
cussed, and conclusions are drawn in Section 6.


2	Data preparation and 
experimental setup

First, we identify the textual corpora 
used. We then describe the general 
experimental setup of learn- ing 
curve experiments, and the IGTR EE  
decision- tree induction algorithm 
used throughout all experi- ments.

To generate our word prediction 
examples, we used the “Reuters 
Corpus Volume 1 (English 
Language,
1996-08-20 to 1997-08-19)”1 .   We 
tokenized this
corpus with a rule-based tokenizer,  
and used all
130,396,703 word and punctuation 
tokens for exper- imentation. In the 
remainder of the article we make no 
difference between words and 
punctuation mark- ers; both are 
regarded as tokens.  We separated the 
final 100,000 tokens as a held-out 
test set, hence- forth referred to as R 
EU TER S, and kept the rest as training 
set, henceforth TR A IN -R EU TER S.
  Additionally,  we  selected  two  
test  sets  taken from different 
corpora.  First, we used the Project 
Gutenberg2 version of the novel 
Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by 
Lewis Carroll (Carroll, 1865), 
henceforth A LIC E. As the third test 
set we selected all tokens of the 
Brown corpus part of the Penn Tree- 
bank (Marcus et al., 1993), a 
selected portion of the original one-
million word Brown corpus (Kucˇera 
and Francis, 1967), a collection of 
samples of Amer- ican English in 
many different genres, from sources 
printed in 1961; we refer to this test 
set as B ROWN. In sum, we have three 
test sets, covering texts from the same 
genre and source as the training data, 
a fictional novel, and a mix of genres 
wider than the training set.
  Table 1 summarizes the key 
training and test set statistics. As the 
table shows, the cross-domain cov- 
erages for unigrams and bigrams are 
rather low; not only are these 
numbers the best-case performance 
ceilings, they also imply that a lot of 
contextual information used by the 
machine learning method used in this 
paper will be partly unknown to the 
learner, especially in texts from other 
domains than the training set.

2.2   Experimental setup

All experiments described in this article take the 
form of learning curve experiments (Banko and 
Brill, 2001), in which a sequence of training sets 
is generated with increasing size, where each size 
training set is used to train a model for word predic- 
tion, which is subsequently tested on a held-out test 
set – which is fixed throughout the whole learning 
curve experiment.  Training set sizes are exponen- 
tially grown, as earlier studies have shown that at 
a linear scale, performance effects tend to decrease 
in size, but that when measured with exponentially 
growing training sets, near-constant (i.e. log-linear) 
improvements are observed (Banko and Brill, 2001).
  We create incrementally-sized training sets for the 
word prediction task on the basis of the TR A IN - 
R EU TER S set. Each training subset is created back- 
ward from the point at which the final 100,000-word 
R EU TER S set starts. The increments are exponential 
with base number 10, and for every power of 10 we 
cut off training sets at n times that power, where n =
1, 2, 3, . . . , 8, 9 (for example, 10, 20, . . . , 80, 90).
  The actual examples to learn from are created by 
windowing over all sequences of tokens. We encode 
examples by taking a left context window spanning 
seven tokens, and a right context also spanning seven 
tokens.  Thus, the task is represented by a growing 
number of examples, each characterized by 14 po- 
sitional features carrying tokens as values, and one 
class label representing the word to be predicted. 
The choice for 14 is intended to cover at least the 
superficially most important positional features. We 
assume that a word more distant than seven positions 
left or right of a focus word will almost never be 
more informative for the task than any of the words 
within this scope.


2.3   IGTree

IGTree (Daelemans et al.,  1997) is an algorithm 
for the top-down induction of decision trees.   It 
compresses  a  database  of  labeled  examples  into 
a lossless-compression decision-tree structure that 
preserves the labeling information of all examples, 
and technically should be named a trie according 
to (Knuth, 1973).  A labeled example is a feature- 
value vector, where features in our study represent 
a sequence of tokens representing context, associ- 
ated with a symbolic class label representing the 
word to be predicted.  An IGTR EE  is composed of 
nodes that each represent a partition of the original 
example database, and are labeled by the most fre- 
quent class of that partition.  The root node of the 
trie thus represents the entire example database and 
carries the most frequent value as class label, while 
end nodes (leafs) represent a homogeneous partition 
of the database in which all examples have the same 
class label. A node is either a leaf, or is a non-ending 
node that branches out to nodes at a deeper level of 
the trie.  Each branch represents a test on a feature 
value; branches fanning out of one node test on val- 
ues of the same feature.
  To  attain  high  compression  levels,   IGTR EE 
adopts the same heuristic that most other decision- 
tree induction algorithms adopt, such as C 4.5 (Quin- 
lan, 1993), which is to always branch out testing on 
the most informative, or most class-discriminative 
features first. Like C 4.5, IGTR EE uses information 
gain (IG) to estimate the most informative features. 
The IG of feature i is measured by computing the 
difference in uncertainty (i.e. entropy) between the 
situations without and with knowledge of the value 
of that feature with respect to predicting the class la-
bel: I Gi  = H (C ) − I: ∈Vi  P (v) × H (C |v), where
C is the set of class labels, Vi  is the set of values 
for feature i, and H (C ) = − I:c∈C P (c) log2 P (c)
is the entropy of the class labels.  In contrast with 
C 4.5, IGTR EE computes the IG of all features once 
on the full database of training examples, makes a 
feature ordering once on these computed IG values, 
and uses this ordering throughout the whole trie.
  Another difference with  C 4.5  is  that  IGTR EE 
does not prune its produced trie, so that it performs 
a lossless compression of the labeling information 
of the original example database.   As long as the



database does not contain fully ambiguous examples 
(with the same features, but different class labels), 
the trie produced by IGTR EE  is able to reproduce 
the classifications of all examples in the original ex- 
ample database perfectly.
  Due to the fact that IGTR EE  computes the IG 
of all features once, it is functionally equivalent to 
IB 1-IG (Daelemans et al., 1999), a k-nearest neigh- 
bor classifier for symbolic features, with k  = 1 
and using a particular feature weighting in the sim-

with a lower weight (e.g.  as in the exponential se- 
quence 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . where 2 > 1, 4 > (1 + 2),
8 > (1 + 2 + 4), etc.).  Both algorithms will base 
their classification on the example that matches on 
most features, ordered by their IG, and guess a ma- 
jority class of the set of examples represented at the 
level of mismatching.  IGTR EE, therefore, can be 
seen as an approximation of IB 1-IG with k = 1 that 
has favorable asymptotic complexities as compared 
to IB 1-IG.
  IGTR EE’s  computational bottleneck is  the trie 
construction process, which has an asymptotic com- 
plexity of O(n lg(v) f ) of CPU, where n is the num- 
ber of training examples, v is the average branching 
factor of IGTR EE  (how many branches fan out of 
a node, on average), and f is the number of fea- 
tures.   Storing the trie,  on the other hand,  costs 
O(n) in memory, which is less than the O(n f ) of 
IB 1-IG. Classification in IGTR EE takes an efficient 
O(f lg(v)) of CPU, versus the cumbersome worst- 
case O(n f ) of IB 1-IG, that is, in the typical case 
that n is much higher than f or v.
  Interestingly,  IGTR EE   is  functionally  equiva- 
lent to back-off smoothing (Zavrel and Daelemans,
1997), with the IG of the features determining the 
order in which to back off, which in the case of word 
prediction tends to be from the outer context to the 
inner context of the immediately neighboring words. 
Like with probabilistic n-gram based models with 
a back-off smoothing scheme, IGTR EE  will prefer 
matches that are as exact as possible (e.g.  match- 
ing on all 14 features), but will back-off by dis- 
regarding lesser important features first, down to a 
simple bigram model drawing on the most impor- 
tant feature, the immediately preceding left word. 
In sum, IGTR EE shares its scaling abilities with n-

racies of IGTR EE trained on TR A IN -R EU TER S, and

gram models, and its implementation allows it to 
handle large values of n.

3.1   Learning curve experiments


The word prediction accuracy learning curves com- 
puted on the three test sets, and trained on increasing 
portions of TR A IN -R EU TER S, are displayed in Fig- 
ure 1.  The best accuracy observed is 42.2% with
30 million training examples, on R EU TER S. Appar- 
ently, training and testing on the same type of data 
yields markedly higher prediction accuracies than 
testing on a different-type corpus.   Accuracies on 
B ROWN  are slightly higher than on A LIC E, but the 
difference is small; at 30 million training examples, 
the accuracy on A LIC E  is 12.6%, and on B ROWN
15.8%.

  A second observation is that all three learning 
curves are progressing upward with more training 
examples, and roughly at a constant log-linear rate. 
When estimating the rates after about 50,000 exam- 
ples (before which the curves appear to be more 
volatile), with every tenfold increase of the num- 
ber of training examples the prediction accuracy on 
R EU TER S increases by a constant rate of about 8%, 
while the increases on A LIC E and B ROWN are both 
about 2% at every tenfold.

The numbers of nodes exhibit an interesting sublin- 
ear relation with respect to the number of training 
examples, which is in line with the asymptotic com- 
plexity order O(n), where n is the number of train- 
ing instances.   An increasingly sublinear amount 
of nodes is necessary; while at 10,000 training in- 
stances the number of nodes is 7,759 (0.77 nodes 
per instance), at 1 million instances the number of 
nodes is 652,252 (0.65 nodes per instance), and at 30

million instances the number of nodes is 15,956,878
(0.53 nodes per instance).
  A factor in classification speed is the average 
amount of branching. Conceivably, the word predic- 
tion task can lead to a large branching factor, espe- 
cially in the higher levels of the tree. However, not 
every word can be the neighbor of every other word 
in finite amounts of text.  To estimate the average 
branching factor of a tree we compute the f th root 
of the total number of nodes (f  being the number 
of features, i.e.  14).  The largest decision tree cur- 
rently constructed is the one on the basis of a train- 
ing set of 30 million examples, having 15,956,878 
nodes. This tree has an average branching factor of
1√4  15, 956, 878 ≈ 3.27; all other trees have smaller
branching factors.  Together with the fact that we 
have but 14 features, and the asymptotic complex- 
ity order of classification is O(f lg(v)), where v is 
the average branching factor, classification can be 
expected to be fast.  Indeed, depending on the ma- 
chine’s CPU on which the experiment is run, we 
observe quite favorable classification speeds.  Fig- 
ure 2 displays the various speeds (in terms of the 
number of test tokens predicted per second) attained 
on the three test sets3 .   The best prediction accu- 
racies are still attained at classification speeds of 
over a hundred predicted tokens per second.  Two 
other relevant observations are that first, the classi- 
fication speed hardly differs between the three test 
sets (B ROWN  is classified only slightly slower than 
the other two test sets), indicating that the classifier 
is spending a roughly comparable amount of search- 
ing through the decision trees regardless of genre 
differences.  Second, the decrease in speed settles

racy increases log-linearly, the speed of classifica- 
tion slowly diminishes at decreasing rates.

4   Confusables

Word prediction from context can be considered a 
very hard task, due to the many choices open to the 
predictor at many points in the sequence. Predicting 
content words, for example, is often only possible 
through subtle contextual clues or by having the ap- 
propriate domain or world knowledge, or intimate 
knowledge of the writer’s social context and inten- 
tions. In contrast, certain function words tend to be 
predictable due to the positions they take in syntac- 
tic phrase structure; their high frequency tends to en- 
sure that plenty of examples of them in context are 
available.
  Due to the important role of function words in 
syntactic structure, it can be quite disruptive for a 
parser and for human readers alike to encounter a 
mistyped function word that in its intended form 
is another function word.   In fact, confusable er- 
rors between frequent forms occur relatively fre- 
quently.   Examples of these so-called confusables 
in English are there versus their and the contrac- 
tion they’re;  or the duo than and then.   Confus- 
ables can arise from having the same pronunciation 
(homophones), or having very similar pronunciation 
(country or county) or spelling (dessert, desert), hav-


ing very close lexical semantics (as between among 
and between), or being inflections or case variants of 
the same stem (I versus me, or walk versus walks), 
and may stem from a lack of concentration or expe- 
rience by the writer.
  Distinguishing between confusables is essentially 
the same task as word prediction, except that the 
number of alternative outcomes is small, e.g.  two 
or three, rather than thousands or more. The typical 
application setting is also more specific: given that a

writer has produced a text (e.g. a sentence in a word 
processor), it is possible to check the correctness of 
each occurrence of a word known to be part of a pair 
or triple of confusables.
  We performed a series of experiments on dis- 
ambiguating nine frequent confusables in English 
adopted from (Golding and Roth, 1999).  We em- 
ployed an experimental setting in which we use the 
same experimental data as before, in which only ex- 
amples of the confusable words are drawn – note 
that we ignore possible confusable errors in both 
training and test set. This data set generation proce- 
dure reduces the amount of examples considerably. 
Despite having over 130 million words in TR A IN - 
R EU TER S,  frequent words such as there and than 
occur just over 100,000 times.  To be able to run 
learning curves with more than this relatively small 
amount of examples, we expanded our training ma- 
terial with the New York Times of 1994 to 2002 
(henceforth TR A IN -N Y T),  part of the English Gi- 
gaword collection published by the Linguistic Data 
Consortium, offering 1,096,950,281 tokens.
  As a first illustration of the experimental out- 
comes, we focus on the three-way confusable there
– their – they’re for which we trained one classi- 
fier, which we henceforth refer to as a confusable 
expert.  The learning curve results of this confus- 
able expert are displayed in Figure 3 as the top three 
graphs.   The logarithmic x-axis displays the full 
number of instances from TR A IN -R EU TER S  up to
130.3 million examples, and from TR A IN -N Y T after 
this point. Counter to the learning curves in the all- 
words prediction experiments, and to the observa- 
tion by (Banko and Brill, 2001), the learning curves 
of this confusable triple in the three different data 
sets flatten, and converge, remarkably, to a roughly 
similar score of about 98%.  The convergence only 
occurs after examples from TR A IN -N Y T are added.

TR A IN -R EU TER S  until 130 million examples, and 
on TR A IN -N Y T beyond (marked by the vertical bar).



  In the bottom of the same Figure 3 we have also 
plotted the word prediction accuracies on the three 
words there, their, and they’re attained by the all- 
words predictor described in the previous section on 
the three test sets.  The accuracies, or rather recall 
figures (i.e.   the percentage of occurrences of the 
three words in the test sets which are correctly pre- 
dicted as such), are considerably lower than those on 
the confusable disambiguation task.
  Table 2 presents the experimental results obtained 
on nine confusable sets when training and testing on 
Reuters material.  The third column lists the accu- 
racy (or recall) scores of the all-words word predic- 
tion system at the maximal training set size of 30 
million labeled examples. The fourth columns lists 
the accuracies attained by the confusable expert for 
the particular confusable pair or triple, measured at
30 million training examples, from which each par- 
ticular confusable expert’s examples are extracted. 
The amount of examples varies for the selected con- 
fusable sets, as can be seen in the second column.
  Scores attained by the all-words predictor on 
these words vary from below 10% for relatively low- 
frequent words to around 60% for the more frequent 
confusables; the latter numbers are higher than the

Table 2: Disambiguation scores on nine confusable 
set, attained by the all-words prediction classifier 
trained on 30 million examples of TR A IN -R EU TER S, 
and by confusable experts on the same training set. 
The second column displays the number of exam- 
ples of each confusable set in the 30-million word 
training set; the list is ordered on this column.



overall accuracy of this system on R EU TER S.  Nev- 
ertheless they are considerably lower than the scores 
attained by the confusable disambiguation classi- 
fiers, while being trained on many more examples 
(i.e., all 30 million available).  Most of the confus- 
able disambiguation classifiers attain accuracies of 
well above 90%.
  When the learning curves are continued beyond 
TR A IN -R EU TER S  into TR A IN -N Y T,  about a thou- 
sand times as many training examples can be gath- 
ered as training data for the confusable experts. Ta- 
ble 3 displays the nine confusable expert’s scores af- 
ter being trained on examples extracted from a total 
of one billion words of text, measured on all three 
test sets. Apart from a few outliers, most scores are 
above 90%, and more importantly, the scores on A L- 
IC E and B ROWN do not seriously lag behind those on 
R EU TER S; some are even better.

5   Related work

As remarked in the cases reported in the literature di- 
rectly related to the current article, word prediction 
is a core task to natural language processing, and one 
of the few that takes no annotation layer to provide 
data for supervised machine learning and probabilis- 
tic modeling (Golding and Roth, 1999; Even-Zohar


Table 3: Disambiguation scores on nine confusable 
set, attained by confusable experts trained on ex- 
amples extracted from 1 billion words of text from 
TR A IN -R EU TER S plus TR A IN -N Y T, on the three test 
sets.



and Roth, 2000; Banko and Brill, 2001).  Our dis- 
crete, classificatio-nased approach has the same goal 
as probabilistic methods for language modeling for 
automatic speech recognition (Jelinek, 1998), and is 
also functionally equivalent to n-gram models with 
back-off smoothing (Zavrel and Daelemans, 1997).
  The papers by Golding and Roth, and Banko and 
Brill on confusable correction focus on the more 
common type of than/then confusion that occurs a 
lot in the process of text production.  Both pairs of 
authors use the confusable correction task to illus- 
trate scaling issues, as we have.  Golding and Roth 
illustrate that multiplicative weight-updating algo- 
rithms such as Winnow can deal with immense in- 
put feature spaces, where for each single classifica- 
tion only a small number of features is actually rel- 
evant (Golding and Roth, 1999). With IGTR EE we 
have an arguably competitive efficient, but one-shot 
learning algorithm; IGTR EE does not need an itera- 
tive procedure to set weights, and can also handle a 
large feature space. Instead of viewing all positional 
features as containers of thousands of atomic word 
features, it treats the positional features as the basic 
tests, branching on the word values in the tree.
  More generally, as a precursor to the above- 
mentioned work, confusable disambiguation has 
been investigated in a string of papers discussing the 
application of various machine learning algorithms 
to the task (Yarowsky, 1994; Golding, 1995; Mangu


and Brill, 1997; Huang and Powers, 2001).

6   Discussion

In this article we explored the scaling abilities of 
IGTR EE, a simple decision-tree algorithm with fa- 
vorable asymptotic complexities with respect to 
multi-label classification tasks.  IGTR EE  is applied 
to word prediction, a task for which virtually un- 
limited amounts of training examples are available, 
with very large amounts of predictable class labels; 
and confusable disambiguation, a specialization of 
word prediction focusing on small sets of confusable 
words. Best results are 42.2% correctly predicted to- 
kens (words and punctuation markers) when training 
and testing on data from the Reuters newswire cor- 
pus; and confusable disambiguation accuracies of 
well above 90%. Memory requirements and speeds 
were shown to be realistic.
  Analysing the results of the learning curve experi- 
ments with increasing amounts of training examples, 
we observe that better word prediction accuracy can 
be attained simply by adding more training exam- 
ples, and that the progress in accuracy proceeds at a 
log-linear rate. The best rate we observed was an 8% 
increase in performance every tenfold multiplication 
of the number of training examples, when training 
and testing on the same data.
  Despite the fact that all-words prediction lags be- 
hind in disambiguating confusibles, in comparison 
with classifiers that are focused on disambiguating 
single sets of confusibles, we see that this lag is only 
relative to the amount of training material available.
