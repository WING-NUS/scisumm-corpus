Abstract 
The integration of semantic properties into mor-
phological analyzers can significantly enhance the 
performance of any tool that uses their output as 
input, e.g., for derivation or for syntactic parsing. 
In this paper will be presented my approach to the 
integration of aspectually relevant properties of 
verbs into a morphological analyzer for English. 
1 Introduction 
Heid, Radtke and Klosa (2012) have recently sur-
veyed morphological analyzers and interactive 
online dictionaries for German and French. They 
have established that most of them do not utilize 
semantic properties. The integration of semantic 
properties into morphological analyzers can sig-
nificantly enhance the performance of any tool that 
uses their output as input, e.g., for derivation or for 
syntactic parsing. In this paper will be presented 
my approach to the integration of aspectually rele-
vant properties of verbs into a morphological ana-
lyzer for English. 
In section 2 I will describe a prototypical finite-
state morphological analyzer for English that 
doesn?t utilize semantic properties. Some classifi-
cations of English verbs with respect to the aspec-
tually relevant properties that they lexicalize will 
be outlined in section 3. In section 4 will be pre-
sented my approach to the integration the semantic 
classes in the lexicon. I will describe the modified 
morphological analyzer for English in section 5 
and point out in section 6 the challenges that 
inflectionally-rich languages present to the tech-
niques outlined in section 4.  
Finally, in section 7 I will draw some conclu-
sions and outline future work on other languages. 
2 A Prototypical Finite-State Morpho-
logical Analyzer for English 
English is an inflectionally-poor language which 
for this reason has been chosen to illustrate my 
approach to the integration of grammatically rele-
vant lexicalized meaning into morphological ana-
lyzers. It has a finite number of irregular (strong) 
verbs. The rest of the verbs are regular and consti-
tute a single inflectional class.  
This prototypical morphological analyzer for 
English has parallel implementations in xfst (cf. 
Beesley and Karttunen (2003)) and foma (cf. Hul-
den (2009a) and (2009b)). It consists of a lexicon 
that describes the morphotactics of the language, 
and of phonological and orthographical alterna-
tions and realizational rules that are handled by 
finite-state replace rules elsewhere. The bases of 
the regular verbs are stored in a single text file. 
Here is an excerpt from the lexc lexicon without 
semantic features:

3 Aspectually Relevant Properties of 
Verbs 
The information that is provided by the prototypi-
cal analyzer described above contains lemma, 
W(ord)-features (morphosyntactic features that 
exhibit different specifications in different cells of 
the same inflectional paradigm) and L(exeme)-
features that ?specify a lexeme?s invariant mor-
phosyntactic properties? (e.g., gender of nouns, cf. 
Stump (2001), p. 137, emphasis mine). 
L-features should not be confused with lexical-
ized meaning. I adopt the definition in Rappaport 
Hovav and Levin (2010), p. 23: ?In order to distin-
guish lexicalized meaning from inferences derived 
from particular uses of verbs in sentences, we take 
lexicalized meaning to be those components of 
meaning that are entailed in all uses of (a single 
sense of) a verb, regardless of context? (emphasis 
mine). Obviously, this definition is applicable not 
only to verbs but to all word classes. 
However, in this paper I will limit myself to the 
description of lexicalized aspectually relevant 
properties of verbs. 
3.1 Vendler?s Classification 
In his famous paper ?Verbs and Times? Vendler 
(1957) introduced his ?time schemata presupposed 
by various verbs? (ibid.). He proposes four time 
schemata: states, activities, accomplishments and 
achievements. 
It is important to point out from the beginning 
that although he didn?t declare explicitly that he 
was classifying VPs, he did imply this: ?Obviously 
these differences cannot be explained in terms of 
time alone: other factors, like the presence or 
absence of an object, conditions, intended state 
of affairs, also enter the picture.? (ibid., p. 143, 
emphasis mine). 
The properties that are often used to define 
Vendler?s classes are dynamicity, duration and 
telicity. States are non-dynamic, achievements are 
non-durative. States and activities are inherently 
unbounded (non-telic); accomplishments and 
achievements are inherently bounded. Since three 
features are needed to differentiate between only 
four classes that cannot be represented as, e.g., a 
right-branching tree one wonders if these are the 
right features to be used for the classification.  
Vendler?s classification was widely accepted 
and is used in most current studies on aspect. 
However, Vendlerian classes cannot be imple-
mented in a lexc lexicon for the following reasons: 
? Vendler does not classify verbs but VPs 
? Part of the features used to differentiate be-
tween the classes are not lexicalized by the 
verb but can be determined at the VP level 
? This classification allows multiple class 
membership even for the same word sense. 
Thus run can be activity and accomplish-
ment, cf. above running/running a mile. 
3.2 Levin and Rappaport Hovav?s Approach 
to English Verb classes 
Sets of semantically related verbs that share a 
range of linguistic properties form verb classes. 
There are different criteria for grouping and granu-
larity, e.g., Levin (1993) classifies the verbs in two 
ways: a) according to semantic content with 48 
broad classes and 192 smaller classes; b) according 
to their participation in argument alternations with 
79 alternations. The account of Beth Levin and 
Malka Rappaport Hovav for verb classes devel-
oped over the years in a steady and consistent way 
that can be trailed in the following publications: 
(Levin 1993; Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1991, 
1995, 2005; Rappaport Hovav 2008; Rappaport 
Hovav and Levin 1998, 2001, 2005, 2010), among 
others.  
Here I will just summarize the most important 
ideas and implications for the non-stative verbs: 
? Dynamic verbs either lexicalize scales (sca-
lar verbs) or do not (non-scalar verbs) 
? Non-scalar verbs lexicalize manner 
? Scalar verbs lexicalize result 
? Scalar verbs lexicalize two major types of 
scales ? multi-point scales and two-point 
scales 
? The chosen aspectually relevant properties 
are complementary 
? All lexical distinctions described here have 
grammatical consequences which are rele-
vant to aspectual composition. 
 
This interpretation of non-stative verbs has some 
very attractive properties:  
? The verbs fall into disjunctive classes. 
There is no multiple class membership (for 
the same word sense).  
? The aspectual properties are lexicalized ex-
clusively by the verb and are not computed 
at the VP level.  
31
? The lexicalized aspectual properties con-
strain the syntactical behavior of the verb.  
? Manner verbs in English show a uniform 
argument-realization pattern: they can ap-
pear with unspecified and non-
subcategorized objects. 
? Result verbs are more constrained and less 
uniform in their argument realization pat-
terns. Transitivity (in contrast to the manner 
verbs) is an issue.   
4 Intersection of Semantic Classes and 
Inflectional Classes 
The main difficulties here arise from the fact that 
the set of bases that belong to one inflectional class 
of verbs usually is not identical with the set of 
bases that lexicalize a particular aspectually rele-
vant property. As a rule, it has intersections with 
more than one semantic class. The situation is rela-
tively manageable in inflectionally-poor languages 
like English but becomes very complicated in 
inflectionally-rich languages. 
The distribution of verbs in inflectional classes 
is in general complementary. There are some ex-
ceptions that will not be discussed here. 
Vendler?s approach to the verb classification 
described in 3.1 has the undesirable property that 
most of the verbs have multiple class membership, 
while the approach of Levin and Rappaport Hovav 
described in 3.2 has advantages which make the 
task easier. 
Thus, for English we have the set of bases of 
regular verbs that is monolithic, and the same set 
of bases but this time divided into complementary 
subsets of aspectual semantic classes in the sense 
of Levin and Rappaport Hovav. The cross product 
of the number of subsets in the first set and the 
number of subsets in the second set equals the 
number of aspectual semantic classes since there is 
only one inflectional class of regular verbs. 
5 The modified Prototypical Lexicon for 
English 
The following modifications need to be introduced 
to the lexicon in order to incorporate the aspectual 
properties of English verbs. 
The single placeholder pointing to the single 
file containing the bases of regular verbs must be 
replaced with several placeholders that point to the 
files containing the complementary subsets of 
bases of verbs belonging to the different aspectual 
classes. 
New continuation lexicons introducing each as-
pectual class must be added immediately after 
LEXICON Verb. Since the union of the sets of 
aspectual-class bases of regular verbs is identical 
with the set of the bases of the regular verbs, all 
aspectual-class lexicons have the same continua-
tion lexicon: LEXICON VerbRegFlex. Irregular 
verbs get the semantic tags added to the lexical 
entry and suppletive verbs get them in the master 
lexicon.

Below is an excerpt from the file holding the 
bases of irregular verbs that build identical past-
tense and perfect-participle forms by adding ?-t?: 
? 
{creep<manner>}:{creep} | 
{feel} | 
{keep} | 
{sleep} | 
{sweep<manner>}:{sweep} | 
? 
 
In order to be able to rewrite the semantic-class 
tags, which appear only on the lexical (upper) side 
of the transducer containing the lexicon, I invert 
the network, apply the semantic-tag rewriting rules 
and invert the resulting net again. The network is 
then composed with the realization rules and the 
32
phonological and orthographical alternations that 
operate on the surface (lower) side of the trans-
ducer: 
 
! Semantic-features tag-rewriting  
define LEX2 [LEX1.i] ; 
define LEX2 [LEX1.i] ; 
define Mnr [ %< m a n n e r %> ->  
       %<%+SV%>%<%+SVO%>%<%+SVOOC%> ] ;  
 
! alternative RRG tags 
!define Mnr  [%< m a n n e r %> ->  
!%<do? %(x%, %[predicate? %(x%) or 
!            %(x%, y%)%]%)%>] ;  
 
define LEX3 [LEX2 .o. Mnr] ; 
define LEX  [LEX3.i] ; 
 
! Inflectional morphology: realization  
? 
 
Here is the output of the analysis of ?swept? with 
dependency-grammar valency-pattern tags 
(S=subject, V=verb, O=object, OC=object com-
plement): 
 
swept 
sweep<+SV><+SVO><+SVOOC>+V+Past 
sweep<+SV><+SVO><+SVOOC>+V+PaPart 
 
and the alternative output with Role and Reference 
Grammar logical structures: 
 
swept 
sweep<do?(x,[predicate?(x)or(x,y)])>+V+Past 
sweep<do?(x,[predicate?(x)or(x,y)])>+V+PaPart 
 
Valency information is necessary for syntactic 
parsing and has been used in Constraint Grammar 
shallow parsers and in dependency parsers. The 
advantage of this approach to already existing mor-
phological analyzers for English is that the 
valency-pattern tags are added to classes of verbs 
rather than to individual lexical entries. The ability 
to provide alternative outputs for the integrated 
aspectually relevant semantic information is a nov-
elty of this morphological analyzer. 
6 Beyond English: the Challenges of In-
flectionally-Rich Languages 
We have seen a simplified example that shows the 
modeling and the implementation of a morphologi-
cal analyzer that utilizes semantic-class tags for 
aspectually relevant lexical properties of English 
verbs.  
Things become much more challenging if we 
want to model inflectionally-rich languages such as 
Bulgarian, Russian or Finnish. Bulgarian verbs, for 
example, can be divided (depending on the model-
ing) into some 15 complementary inflectional 
classes.  This number multiplied by 4 Levin-
Rappaport-Hovav classes would result in some 60 
sets of verb bases that share the same inflectional 
class and Levin-Rappaport-Hovav class. If a finer-
grained semantic classification is adopted, the 
number of classes will considerably increase and 
this will lead to a lexicon that exclusively requires 
manual lexicographical work.  
7 Conclusion 
This paper illustrates the integration of aspectually 
relevant properties of verbs into a morphological 
analyzer for English. I showed that these features 
can be integrated while the computational effi-
ciency of the analyzer can still be maintained if the 
linguistic modelling is adequate. However, this 
only scratches the surface of the challenge of inte-
grating semantic features into morphological ana-
lyzers. In the future, it is planned (together with 
other researchers) to extend the integration of se-
mantic features to nouns, adjectives and adverbs. 
We also plan to model and implement morphologi-
cal analyzers for other languages such as German, 
Russian, Polish and Bulgarian.
