			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">The entity set expansion problem is defined as follows: Given a set S of seed entities of a particular class, and a set D of candidate entities (e.g., extracted from a text corpus), we wish to determine which of the entities in D belong to S. In other words, we “expand” the set S based on the given seeds.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">This is clearly a classification problem which requires arriving at a binary decision for each entity in D (belonging to S or not).</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">However, in practice, the problem is often solved as a ranking problem, i.e., ranking the entities in D based on their likelihoods of belonging to S. The classic method for solving this problem is based on distributional similarity (Pantel et al. 2009; Lee, 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">The approach works by comparing the similarity of the surrounding word distributions of each candidate entity with the seed entities, and then ranking the candidate entities using their similarity scores.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">In machine learning, there is a class of semi- supervised learning algorithms that learns from positive and unlabeled examples (PU learning for short).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">The key characteristic of PU learning is that there is no negative training example available for learning.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">This class of algorithms is less known to the natural language processing (NLP) community compared to some other semi- supervised learning models and algorithms.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">PU learning is a two-class classification model.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">It is stated as follows (Liu et al. 2002): Given a set P of positive examples of a particular class and a set U of unlabeled examples (containing hidden positive and negative cases), a classifier is built using P and U for classifying the data in U or future test cases.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">The results can be either binary decisions (whether each test case belongs to the positive class or not), or a ranking based on how likely each test case belongs to the positive class represented by P. Clearly, the set expansion problem can be mapped into PU learning exactly, with S and D as P and U respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">This paper shows that a PU learning method called S-EM (Liu et al. 2002) outperforms distributional similarity considerably based on the results from 10 corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">The experiments involved extracting named entities (e.g., product and organization names) of the same type or class as the given seeds.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Additionally, we also compared S-EM with a recent method, called Bayesian Sets (Ghahramani and Heller, 2005), which was designed specifically for set expansion.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">It also does not perform as well as PU learning.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">We will explain why PU learning performs better than both methods in Section 5.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">We believe that this finding is of interest to the NLP community.</S>

	<SECTION title="Three Different Techniques. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "1">2.1 Distributional Similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "2">Distributional similarity is a classic technique for the entity set expansion problem.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "3">It is based on the hypothesis that words with similar meanings tend to appear in similar contexts (Harris, 1985).</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "4">As such, a method based on distributional similarity typically fetches the surrounding contexts for each term (i.e. both seeds and candidates) and represents them as vectors by using TFIDF or PMI (Pointwise Mutual Information) values (Lin, 1998; Gorman and Curran, 2006; Paşca et al. 2006; Agirre et al. 2009; Pantel et al. 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "5">Similarity measures such as Cosine, Jaccard, Dice, etc, can then be employed to compute the similarities between each candidate vector and the seeds centroid vector (one centroid vector for all seeds).</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "6">Lee (1998) surveyed and discussed various distribution similarity measures.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "7">2.2 PU Learning and S-EM.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "8">PU learning is a semi-supervised or partially supervised learning model.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "9">It learns from positive and unlabeled examples as opposed to the model of learning from a small set of labeled examples of every class and a large set of unlabeled examples, which we call LU learning (L and U stand for labeled and unlabeled respectively) (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Nigam et al. 2000) There are several PU learning algorithms (Liu et al. 2002; Yu et al. 2002; Lee and Liu, 2003; Li et al. 2003; Elkan and Noto, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "10">In this work, we used the S-EM algorithm given in (Liu et al. 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "11">S-EM is efficient as it is based on naïve Bayesian (NB) classification and also performs well.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "12">The main idea of S-EM is to use a spy technique to identify some reliable negatives (RN) from the unlabeled set U, and then use an EM algorithm to learn from P, RN and U–RN.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "13">The spy technique in S-EM works as follows (Figure 1): First, a small set of positive examples (denoted by SP) from P is randomly sampled (line 2).</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "14">The default sampling ratio in S-EM is s = 15%, which we also used in our experiments.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "15">The positive examples in SP are called “spies”.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "16">Then, a NB classifier is built using the set P– SP as positive and the set U∪SP as negative (line 3, 4, and 5).</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "17">The NB classifier is applied to classify each u ∈ U∪SP, i.e., to assign a probabilistic class label p(+|u) (+ means positive).</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "18">The probabilistic labels of the spies are then used to decide reliable negatives (RN).</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "19">In particular, a probability threshold t is determined using the probabilistic labels of spies in SP and the input parameter l (noise level).</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "20">Due to space constraints, we are unable to explain l. Details can be found in (Liu et al. 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "21">t is then used to find RN from U (lines 810).</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "22">The idea of the spy technique is clear.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "23">Since spy examples are from P and are put into U in building the NB classifier, they should behave similarly to the hidden positive cases in U. Thus, they can help us find the set RN.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "24">Algorithm Spy(P, U, s, l) 1.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "25">RN ← ∅; // Reliable negative set.</S>

			<S sid ="53" ssid = "27">SP ← Sample(P, s%);.</S>

			<S sid ="66" ssid = "40">Spy technique for extracting reliable negatives (RN) from U. Given the positive set P, the reliable negative set RN and the remaining unlabeled set U–RN, an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is run.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "41">In S-EM, EM uses the naïve Bayesian classification as its base method.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "42">The detailed algorithm is given in (Liu et al. 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "43">2.3 Bayesian Sets.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "44">Bayesian Sets, as its name suggests, is based on Bayesian inference, and was designed specifically for the set expansion problem (Ghahramani and Heller, 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "45">The algorithm learns from a seeds set (i.e., a positive set P) and an unlabeled candidate set U. Although it was not designed as a PU learning method, it has similar characteristics and produces similar results as PU learning.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "46">However, there is a major difference.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "47">PU learning is a classification model, while Bayesian Sets is a ranking method.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "48">This difference has a major implication on the results that they produce as we will discuss in Section 5.3.In essence, Bayesian Sets learns a score func tion using P and U to generate a score for each unlabeled case u ∈ U. The function is as follows: Positive and unlabeled sets: For each seed si ∈S, each occurrence in the corpus forms a vector as a positive example in P. The vector is formed score(u) = p(u | P) p(u) (1) based on the surrounding words context (see above) of the seed mention.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "49">Similarly, for each where p(u|P) represents how probable u belongs to the positive class represented by P. p(u) is the prior probability of u. Using the Bayes’ rule, equation (1) can be rewritten as: candidate d ∈ D (see above; D denotes the set of all candidates), each occurrence also forms a vector as an unlabeled example in U. Thus, each unique seed or candidate entity may produce score (u ) = p(u, P) p(u ) p( P) (2) multiple feature vectors, depending on the number of times that it appears in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "50">Following the idea, Ghahramani and Heller (2005) proposed a computable score function.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "51">The scores can be used to rank the unlabeled candidates in U to reflect how likely each u ∈ U belongs to P. The mathematics for computing the score is involved.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "52">Due to the limited space, we cannot discuss it here.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "53">See (Ghahramani and Heller, 2005) for details.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "54">In (Heller and Ghahramani, 2006), Bayesian Sets was also applied to an image retrieval application.</S>

	<SECTION title="Data   Generation   for   Distributional. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "1">Similarity, Bayesian Sets and S-EM Preparing the data for distributional similarity is fairly straightforward.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "2">Given the seeds set S, a seeds centroid vector is produced using the surrounding word contexts (see below) of all occurrences of all the seeds in the corpus (Pantel et al, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "3">In a similar way, a centroid is also produced for each candidate (or unlabeled) entity.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "4">Candidate entities: Since we are interested in named entities, we select single words or phrases as candidate entities based on their corresponding part-of-speech (POS) tags.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "5">In particular, we choose the following POS tags as entity indicators — NNP (proper noun), NNPS (plural proper noun), and CD (cardinal number).</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "6">We regard a phrase (could be one word) with a sequence of NNP, NNPS and CD POS tags as one candidate entity (CD cannot be the first word unless it starts with a letter), e.g., “Windows/NNP 7/CD” and “Nokia/NNP N97/CD” are regarded as two candidates “Windows 7” and “Nokia N97”.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "7">Context: For each seed or candidate occurrence, the context is its set of surrounding words within a window of size w, i.e. we use w words right before the seed or the candidate and w words right after it.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "8">Stop words are removed.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "9">For S-EM and Bayesian Sets, both the positive set P (based on the seeds set S) and the unlabeled candidate set U are generated differently.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "10">The components in the feature vectors are term frequencies for S-EM as S-EM uses naïve Bayesian classification as its base classifier.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "11">For Bayesian Sets, they are 1’s and 0’s as Bayesian Sets only takes binary vectors based on whether a term occurs in the context or not.</S>
	</SECTION>
	<SECTION title="Candidate Ranking. " number = "4">
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "1">For distributional similarity, ranking is done using the similarity value of each candidate’s centroid and the seeds’ centroid (one centroid vector for all seeds).</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "2">Rankings for S-EM and Bayesian Sets are more involved.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "3">We discuss them below.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "4">After it ends, S-EM produces a Bayesian classifier C, which is used to classify each vector u ∈ U and to assign a probability p(+|u) to indicate the likelihood that u belongs to the positive class.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "5">Similarly, Bayesian Sets produces a score score(u) for each u (not a probability).</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "6">Recall that for both S-EM and Bayesian Sets, each unique candidate entity may generate multiple feature vectors, depending on the number of times that the candidate entity occurs in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "7">As such, the rankings produced by S-EM and Bayesian Sets are not the rankings of the entities, but rather the rankings of the entities’ occurrences.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "8">Since different vectors representing the same candidate entity can have very different probabilities (for S-EM) or scores (for Bayesian Sets), we need to combine them and compute a single score for each unique candidate entity for ranking.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "9">To this end, we also take the entity frequency into consideration.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "10">Typically, it is highly desirable to rank those correct and frequent entities at the top because they are more important than the infrequent ones in applications.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "11">With this in mind, we define a ranking method.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "12">Let the probabilities (or scores) of a candidate entity d ∈ D be Vd = {v1 , v2 …, vn} for the n fea ture vectors of the candidate.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "13">Let Md be the median of Vd.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "14">The final score (fs) for d is defined as: They are not represented as centroids.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "15">fs(d ) = M d × log(1 + n) (3) The use of the median of Vd can be justified based on the statistical skewness (Neter et al. 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "16">If the values in Vd are skewed towards the high side (negative skew), it means that the candidate entity is very likely to be a true entity, and we should take the median as it is also high (higher than the mean).</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "17">However, if the skew is towards the low side (positive skew), it means that the candidate entity is unlikely to be a true entity and we should again use the median as it is low (lower than the mean) under this condition.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "18">Note that here n is the frequency count of candidate entity d in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "19">The constant 1 is added to smooth the value.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "20">The idea is to push the frequent candidate entities up by multiplying the logarithm of frequency.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "21">log is taken in order to reduce the effect of big frequency counts.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "22">The final score fs(d) indicates candidate d’s overall likelihood to be a relevant entity.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "23">A high fs(d) implies a high likelihood that d is in the expanded entity set.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "24">We can then rank all the candidates based on their fs(d) values.</S>

			<S sid ="153" ssid = "38">Bayesian Sets is better because it considers U. Its learning method produces a weight vector for features based on their occurrence differences in the positive set P and the unlabeled set U (Ghahramani and Heller 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="154" ssid = "39">This weight vector is then used to compute the final scores used in ranking.</S>
			<S sid ="155" ssid = "40">In this way, Bayesian Sets is able to exploit the useful information in U that was ignored by distributional similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="156" ssid = "41">S-EM also considers these differences in its NB classification; in addition, it uses the reliable negative set (RN) to help distinguish negative and positive cases, which both Bayesian Sets and distributional similarity do not do.</S>
			<S sid ="157" ssid = "42">We believe this balanced attempt by S-EM to distinguish the positive and negative cases is the reason for the better performance of S-EM.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "43">This raises an interesting question.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "44">Since Bayesian Sets is a ranking method and S-EM is a classification method, can we say even for ranking (our evaluation is based on ranking) classification methods produce better results than ranking methods?</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "45">Clearly, our single experiment cannot answer this question.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "46">But intuitively, classification, which separates positive and negative cases by pulling them towards two opposite directions, should perform better than ranking which only pulls the data in one direction.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "47">Further research on this issue is needed.</S>

			<S sid ="163" ssid = "1">Although distributional similarity is a classic technique for entity set expansion, this paper showed that PU learning performs considerably better on our diverse corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "2">In addition, PU learning also outperforms Bayesian Sets (designed specifically for the task).</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "3">In our future work, we plan to experiment with various other PU learning methods (Liu et al. 2003; Lee and Liu, 2003; Li et al. 2007; Elkan and Noto, 2008) on this entity set expansion task, as well as other tasks that were tackled using distributional similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "4">In addition, we also plan to combine some syntactic patterns (Etzioni et al. 2005; Sarmento et al. 2007) to further improve the results.</S>
