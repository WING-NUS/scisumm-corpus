Abstract

This paper presents our recent work for 
participation in the Second Interna- 
tional Chinese Word Segmentation 
Bakeoff. According to difficulties, we 
divide word segmentation into several 
sub-tasks, which are solved by mixed 
language models, so as to take advan-

1    Introduction

Word is a logical semantic and syntactic unit in 
natural language. So word segmentation is the 
foundation of most Chinese NLP tasks. Though 
much progress has been made in the last two 
decades,  there  is  no  existing  model  that  can 
solve all the problems perfectly at present. So 
we  try  to  apply different language models to

   Our system participated in the Second Inter- 
national Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff 
(henceforce, the bakeoff) held in 2005. Recently, 
we have done more work in dealing with three 
main sub-tasks: (1) Segmentation disambigua-


Figure 1 ELUS Segmenter
   Class-based trigram model (Gao 2004) is 
adopted in the Basic Segmentation to convert 
the sentence into a word sequence. Let w = w1 
w2 …wn be a word class sequence, then the most 
likely word class sequence w* in trigram is:

words1 detection. We apply different approachs 
to solve above three problems, and all the mod-
ules  are  integrated  into  a  pragmatic  system
(ELUS). Due to the limitation of available re- 
source, some kinds of features, e.g. POS, have 
been erased in our participation system. This 
segmenter will be briefly describled in this paper.


1 New words refer to this kind of out-of –vocabulary words 
that are neither recognized named entities or factoid words 
nor morphological words.

   where let P(w0|w-2  w-1) be P(w0) and let 
P(w1|w-1 w0) be P(w1|w0). And wi represents LW 
or a type of FT or MDW. Viterbi algorithm is 
used to search the best candidate. Absolute 
smoothing algorithm is applied to overcome the 
data sparseness. Here, LW, FT and MDW are 
idendified (Zhao Yan 2005). All the Factoid 
words can be represented as regular expressions. 
As a result, the detection of factoid words can be 
archieved by Finite State Machines.


   Four kinds of Named entities are detected, i.e. 
Chinese person name, foreign person name, lo- 
cation name and orgnization name. This is the 
most complicated module in ELUS.
   Three  kinds  of  models  are  applied  here. 
HMM model (one order) is described as:
n


ELUS, the most segmentation errors are one 
segmentation errors (about 95%). i.e. the two 
words on both sides of current segmentation 
errors are right. These include LW 
ambiguities and FT ambiguities etc. Here, we 
adopt Maxi- mum Entropy model. The same as 
other mod- ules, it is defined over HhT  in 
segmentation

disambiguation, where H is 
the set of possible contexts 
around target word that will 
be tagged,


where Ti


represents the 
tag of current 
word,


and  T  is  
the  set  of  
allowable 
tags.  Then 
the


Viterbi algorithm is used to search the best path.


model’s conditional probability is defined as


Another model is Maximum Entropy (Zhao Jian
2005,  Hai  Leong Chieu 2002). Take Chinese 
person name as example. Firstly, we combine



p(t | h)


p(h, t )
¦t 'T  p(h, t ' )





,	where


HMM and Maximum Entropy (ME) model to 
lable the person name tag, e.g. “ྮ/CPB 䪰/CPI 
ṙ/CPI” (Tongmei Yao); Secondly, the tagged



p(h, t)


k
SP 	D
j  1



f j ( h,t )
j


name is merged by combining ME Model and 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and some aided 
rules, e.g. merged into “ྮ/䪰ṙ” in PKU test.
   Some complex features are added into ME 
model (described in Zhao Jian 2005), in addition, 
we also collect more than 110,000 person names, 
and acquire the statistic about common name 
characters, these kinds of features are also fused 
into the ME model to detect NE. The other kinds 
of NE recognition adopt similar method, except 
for individual features.
   New  Words  is  another  important  kind  of 
OOV words, especially in closed test. Take PKU 
test as example, we collect NW suffixes, such as 
“Ꮦ”(city),”♃”(lamp). Those usually construct 
new words, e.g. “᱃㾖♃”(sighting lamp).
   A variance-based method is used to collect 
suffixes. And three points need to be consid- 
ered:(1) It is tail of many words;(2) It has large 
variance in constructing word;(3) It is seldom 
used alone. We acquire about 25 common suf- 
fixes in PKU training corpus by above method.
   We use Local Maximum Entropy model, e.g. 
“ 咘ݜ/1 Ꮦ/1”(Huanggang city), i.e. only the 
nearer characters are judged before the suffix
“Ꮦ” (city). By our approach, the training corpus 
can be generated via given PKU corpus in the
bakeoff. The features come from the nearer con-
text, besides, common single words and punc- 
tuations are not regarded as a part of New Word.
The  last  module  is  Word  Disambiugation.
Word segmentation ambiguities are usually clas- 
sified into two classes: overlapping ambiguity 
and   combination   ambiguity.   By   evaluating


where h is current context and t is one of the
possible tags. The ambiguous words are mainly 
collected by evaluating our system.
In  NE  module  and  Word  Disambiguation
module, we introduce rough rule features, 
which are  extracted  by  Rough  Set  (Wang  
Xiaolong
2004), e.g. “ᮑሩÆᠡ㛑”(display ability), “া
᳝Æᠡ/㛑”(onlyÆ can just), 
“䆄㗙+person+᡹ 䘧” (the 
reporter+person+report). Previous ex-
periment had indicated word disambiguation 
could achieve better performance by applying 
Rough Set.

3    Performance and 
analysis

The performance of ELUS in the bakeoff is 
pre- sented in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively, 
in terms of recall(R), precision(P) and F score 
in percentages.
Table 1 Closed test, in percentages 
(%)







Table 2 Open test, in percentages 
(%)







   Our system has good performance in 
terms of F-measure in simplified Chinese open 
test, including PKU and MSR open test. In 
addition,


its IV word identification performance is re- 
markable, ranging from 97.7% to 99.1%, stands 
at the top or nearer the top in all the tests in 
which we have participated. This good perform- 
ance owes to class-based trigram, absolute 
smoothing and word disambiguation module and 
rough rules.
   There is almost the same IV performance be- 
tween open test and closed test in MSR, CITYU 
and AS respectively, because we adopt the same 
Lexicon between open test and closed test re- 
spectively. While in open test of PKU, we adopt 
another Lexicon that comes from six-month 
corpora  of  Peoples’  Daily  (China)  in  1998, 
which were also annotated by Peking University.
   The OOV word identification performance 
seems uneven, compared with PKU, the other 
tests seem lower, due to the following reasons:
   (1) Because of our resource limitation, NE 
training resource is six-month corpora of Peo- 
ples’ Daily (China) in 1998, which came from 
Peking University, and some newspapers and 
web pages annotated by our laboratory;
   (2) We have no traditional Chinese corpus, 
so the NE training resource for CITYU and AS 
is acquired via converting above corpora. Since 
these corpora are converted from simplified 
Chinese, they are not well suitable to traditional 
Chinese corpora;
   (3) The different corpora have different crite- 
rions  in  NE  detection,  especially  in  location 
name and organization name, e.g. “የᴥ䬛/佭ූ
/ ⣾എ” (Cuicun Town Xiangtang Hogpen) in 
PKU and “የᴥ䬛佭ූ⣾എ” in MSR criterion. 
Even if our system recognizes the “የᴥ䬛/佭/
ූ/⣾എ” as a orgnization name, we are not eas- 
ily  to  regard  “ 佭 ූ ”  as  one  word  in  PKU,
since ”佭ූ” isn’t a lexical word. However in
MSR, that is easy, because its criterion regard 
the whole Orgnization as a word;
   (4) We need do more to comply with the 
segmentation criterion, e.g. “䴆ᆓ㗙”(outlier) in 
CITYU come from “䴆ᆓ” + “㗙”, while this 
kind of false segment is due to our bad under- 
standing to CITYU criterion.
   Though there are above problems, our sys- 
tem does well in regonization precision, since 
we adopt two steps in recognizing NE, especial 
in recognizing Chinese person name. And from 
the result of evalution in the bakeoff, we need to 
improve the NE recall in the future.
   

In  order  to  make  our  New  words  comply 
with the criterion, we conservatively use New 
Word Detection module, in order to avoid hav- 
ing bad recognition result, since each corpus has 
its own New Word criterion.

4    Conclusion and Future work

We have briefly describled our system based on 
mixed models. Different approachs are adopted 
to solve each special sub-task, since there is “No 
Free Lunch Theorem”. And mixed models are 
used in NE detection. This sytem has a good 
performance in the simplified Chinese in the 
bakeoff.
   The future work is mainly concentrating on 
two directions: finding effective features and 
delicately adjusting internal relations among 
different modules, in order to improve segmen- 
tation performance.
