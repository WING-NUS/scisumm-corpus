This paper discusses the Potsdam Commentary Corpus, a corpus of german assembeled by potsdam university.
The corpus was annoted with different linguitic information.the ‘Potsdam Commentary Corpus’ or PCC consists of
170 commentaries from M¨arkische Allgemeine Zeitung, a German regional daily.This corpus includes 173 texts on politics from the on-line newspaper
Märkische Allgemeine Zeitung. It contains 32,962 words and 2,195 sentences. It is annotated with several data: morphology, syntax, rhetorical
structure, connectors, correference and informative structure. Nevertheless, only a part of this corpus (10 texts), which the authors name "core corpus",
is annotated with all this information. The texts were annotated with the RSTtool. This corpus has several advantages: it is annotated at different
levels.all the texts were annotated by two people.it is free for research purposes.The disadvantages are: the genre and domain of all the texts are the same, the
methodology of annotation was quite intuitive and the inter-annotator agreement is not given.
