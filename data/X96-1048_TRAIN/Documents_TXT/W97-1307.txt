The Input to Reference Resolution Multiple top-scoring sites working on IE have con- verged on the use of finite-state linguistic patterns applied in stages of smaller to larger units. This finite-state transduction approach to IE, first intro- duced in SRI's FASTUS, has proven effective for real-world texts because full parsing is far too am- biguous, slow, and brittle against real-world sen- tences. This means that we cannot assume correct and full syntactic structures in the input to ref- erence resolution in a typical IE system. The in- put is a set of (often overlapping or discontiguous) finite-state approximations of sentence parts. We must approximate fine-grained theoretical propos- als about referential dependencies, and adapt them to the context of sparse and incomplete syntactic input. The input to reference resolution in the the-oretical literature is assumed to be fully parsed sentences, often with syntactic attributes such as grammatical functions and thematic roles on the constituents (Webber, 1978; Sidner, 1979; Hobbs, 1978; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995). In im- plemented reference resolution systems, for pro- noun resolution in particular, there seems to be a trade-off between the completeness of syntac- tic input and the robustness with real-world sen- tences. In short, more robust and partial parsing gives us wider coverage, but less syntactic infor- mation also leads to less accuyate reference reso- lution. For instance, Lappin and Leass (1994) re- port an 86% accuracy for a resolution algorithm for third-person pronouns using fully parsed sen- tences as input. Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) then report a 75% accuracy for an algorithm that approximates Lappin and Leass's with more robust and coarse-grained syntactic input. After describ- ing the algorithm in the next section, I will briefly compare the present approach with these pronoun resolution approaches. 

Algorithm 

This algorithm was first implemented for the MUC-6 FASTUS system (Appelt et al., 1995), and produced one of the top scores (a recall of 59% and precision of 72%) in the MUC-6 Coreference nize coreference among noun phrases (Sundheim, 1995). Note that only identity of reference was evaluated there. 2 
The three main factors in this algorithm are (a) accessible text regions, (b) semantic consistency, and (c) dynamic syntactic preference. The algo- rithm is invoked for each sentence after the earlier finite-state transduction phases have determined the best sequence(s) of nominal and verbal expres- sions. Crucially, each nominal expression is associ- ated with a set of template data objects that record various linguistic and textual attributes of the re- ferring expressions contained in it. These data ob- jects are similar to discourse referents in discourse semantics (Karttunen, 1976; Kamp, 1981; Heim, 1982; Kamp and Reyle, 1993), in that anaphoric expressions such as she are also associated with corresponding anaphoric entities. A pleonastic it has no associated entities. Quantificational nomi- nals such as each company are associated with en- tity objects because they are 'anaphoric' to group entities accessible in the context. In this setup, the effect of reference resolution is merging of multiple entity objects. Here is the algorithm. 
1. INPUT: 	Template entities with the following textual, syntactic, and semantic features: 
(a) 
determiner type (e.g., DEF, INDEF, PRON) 

(b) 
grammatical 	or numerical number (e.g., SG, PL, 3) 

(c) 
head string (e.g., automaker) 

(d) 
the head string sort in a sort hierarchy (e.g., 


aut omaker-+ company-+organizat ion) 


(e) modifier strings (e.g., 	newly founded, with the pilots) 
(f) 
text span (the start and end byte positions) 

(g) 
sentence and paragraph positions 3 

(h) 	
text region type (e.g., HEADLINE, TEXT) 


2Other referential relationships such as subset and part- 

whole did not reach sufficiently reliable interannotator 
agreements. Only identity of reference had a sufficiently 
high agreement rate (about 85%) between two human 
annotators. 
ZHigher text structure properties such as subsections and 

sections should also be considered if there are any. Exact 
accessibility computation using complex hierarchical text 
Task, which evaluated systems' ability to recog-47 structures is a future topic of study. 
2. FOR EACH potentially anaphoric entity object in the current sentence, in the left-to-right order, DO 
(1) COLLECT antecedent entity objects from the 
accessible text region. 
• 
For 	an entity in a HEADLINE text region, the entire TEXT is accessible because the headline summarizes the text. 

• 
For 	an entity in a TEXT region, everything preceding its text span is accessible (except for the HEADLINE). Intrasentential cataphora is allowed only for first-person pronouns. 

• 	
In addition, a locality assumption on anaphora sets a (soft) window of search for each referring expression type--the entire preceding text for proper names, narrower for definite noun phrases, even narrower for pro-nouns, and only the current sentence for re-flexives. In the MUC-6 system, the window size was arbitrarily set to ten sentences for definites and three sentences for pronouns, ignoring paragraph boundariesl and no an-tecedents beyond the limit were considered. This clearly left ample room for refinement. 4 


(2) FILTER 	with semantic consistency between the anaphoric entity E1 and the potential an- tecedent entity E2. 
• 	
Number Consistency: El's number must be consistent with E2's number--for example, twelve is consistent with PLURAL, but not with SINGULAR. As a special case, plural pronouns (they, we) can take singular organi- zation antecedents. 

• 	
Sort Consistency: El's sort must ei-ther EQUAL or SUBSUME E2's sort. This reflects a monotonicity assumption on anaphora--for example, since company sub- sumes automaker, the company can take a Chicago-based automaker as an antecedent, but it is too risky to allow the automaker to take a Chicago-based company as an antecedent. On the other hand, since 


4For example, in a more recent FASTUS system, para-graphs are also considered in setting the limit, and at most one candidate beyond the limit is proposed when no candi-dates are found within the limit. 
automaker and airline are neither the same sort nor in a subsumption relation, an au-tomaker and the airline cannot corefer. (The system's sort hierarchy is still sparse and in- complete.) 
• 	Modifier Consistency: El's modifiers must be consistent with E2's modifiers--for ex-ample, French and British are inconsistent, but French and multinational are consistent. (The system doesn't have enough knowledge to do this well.) 
(3) 
ORDER by dynamic syntactic preference. The following ordering approximates the relative salience of entities. The basic underlying hypothesis is that intrasentential candidates are more salient than intersentential candi-dates as proposed, for example, in Hobbs (1978) and Kameyama (in press), and that fine-grained syntax-based salience fades with time. Since fine-grained syntax with gram-matical functions is unavailable, the syntactic prominence of subjects and left-dislocation is approximated by the left-right linear ordering. 

i. 
the preceding part 	of the same sentence in the left-right order 


ii. the 	immediately preceding sentence in the left-right order 
iii. other preceding sentences within 	the 'limit' (see above) in the right-left order 
3. OUTPUT: After each anaphoric entity has found an ordered set of potential antecedent entities, there are destructive (indefeasible) and nonde-structive (defeasible) options. 
(a) 	
Destructive Option: MERGE the anaphoric entity into the preferred antecedent entity . 

(b) 	
Nondestructive Option: RECORD the an-tecedent entity list in the anaphoric entity to allow reordering (i.e., preference revisions) by event merging or overall model selection. 


The MUC-6 system took the destructive op-tion. The nondestructive option has been im- plemented in a more recent system. 
These basic steps of "COLLECT, FILTER, and ORDER by salience" are analogous to Lappin and 48 Leass's (1994) pronoun resolution algorithm, but each step in FASTUS relies on considerably poorer syntactic input. The present algorithm thus pro- vides an interesting case of what happens with extremely poor syntactic input, even poorer than in Kennedy and Boguraev's (1996) system. This comparison will be discussed later. 

Name Alias Recognition 
In addition to the above general algorithm, a special-purpose alias recognition algorithm is in- voked for coreference resolution of proper names. 5 
1. 
INPUT: 	The input English text is in mixed cases. An earlier transduction phase has rec-ognized unknown names as well as specific-type names for persons, locations, or organizations using name-internal pattern matching and known name lists. 

2. 
FOR EACH new sentence, FOR EACH unknown name, IF it is an alias or acronym of an-other name already recognized in the given text, MERGE the two--an alias is a selective sub- string of the full name (e.g., Colonial for Colo-nial Bee)~, and acronym is a selective sequence of initial characters in the full name (e.g., GM for General Motors). 


Overall Performance 

The MUC-6 FASTUS reference resolution algo-rithm handled only coreference (i.e., identity of ref- erence) of proper names, definites, and pronouns. These are the 'core' anaphoric expression types whose dependencies tend to be constrained by sur- face textual factors such as locality. The MUC-6 Coreference Task evaluation included coreference of bare nominals, possessed nominals, and indefi- nites as well, which the system did not handle be- cause we didn't have a reliable algorithm for these mostly 'accidental' coreferences that seemed to re- quire deeper inferences. Nevertheless, the system scored a recall of 59% and precision of 72% in the blind evaluation of thirty newspaper articles. 
5 In addition, a specific-type name may be converted into another type in certain linguistic contexts. For instance, in a subsidiary of Mrs. Field, Mrs. Field is converted from a person name into a company name.

Table 2: Pronouns in Five Articles 

Table 1 shows the system's performance in re- solving the core discourse anaphors in five ran-domely selected articles from the development set. Only five articles were examined here because the process was highly time-consuming. The perfor- mance for each expression type varies widely from article to article because of unexpected features of the articles. For instance, one of the five articles is a letter to the editor with a text structure drasti- cally different from news reports. On average, we see that the resolution accuracy (i.e., recall) was the highest for proper names (69%), followed by pronouns (62%) and definites (46%). There were not enough instances of reflexives to compare. 
Table 2 shows the system's performance for pro- nouns broken down by two parameters, gram-matical person and inter-vs. intrasentential antecedent. The system did quite well (78%) with third-person pronouns with intrasentential antecedents, the largest class of such pronouns. 
Part of the pronoun resolution performance here enables a preliminary comparison with the results reported in (1) Lappin and Leass (1994) and (2) Kennedy and Boguraev (1996). For the third-person pronouns and reflexives, the performance was (1) 86% of 560 cases in five computer manu- als and (2) 75% of 306 cases in twenty-seven Web page texts. The present FASTUS system correctly resolved 71% of 34 cases in five newspaper arti- 49 cles. This progressive decline in performance cor- responds to the progressive decline in the amount of syntactic information in the input to reference resolution. To summarize the latter decline, Lap-- pin and Leass (1994) had the following components in their algorithm. 
1. 
INPUT: fully parsed sentences with grammati- cal roles and head-argument and head-adjunct relations 

2. 
Intrasentential syntactic filter based on syntactic noncoreference 

3. 
Morphological filter based 	on person, number, and gender features 

4. 
Pleonastic pronoun recognition 

5. 
Intrasentential binding for reflexives and recip- rocals 

6. 
Salience 	computation based on grammatical role, grammatical parallelism, frequency of men- tion, proximity, and sentence recency 

7. 
Global salience computation for 	noun phrases (NPs) in equivalence classes (with seven salience factors) 

8. 
Decision procedure for choosing among equally preferred candidate antecedents 


Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) approximated the above components with a poorer syntactic input, which is an output of a part-of-speech tagger with grammatical function information, plus NPs recog- nized by finite-state patterns and NPs' adjunct and subordination contexts recognized by heuristics. With this input, grammatical functions and prece- dence relations were used to approximate 2 and 
5. Finite-state patterns approximated 4. Three additional salience factors were used in 7, and a preference for intraclausal antecedents was added in 6; 3 and 8 were the same. 
The present algorithm works with an even poorer syntactic input, as summarized here. 
1. INPUT: 	a set of finite-state approximations of sentence parts, which can be overlapping or dis- contiguous, with no grammatical function, sub- ordination, or adjunct information. 
. 
No disjoint reference filter is used. 
3. 	
Morphological filter is used. 

4. 	
Pleonastic pronouns are recognized with finite- state patterns. 


. 	Reflexives simply limit the search to the current sentence, with no attempt at recognizing coar- guments. No reciprocals are treated. 
. 	Salience is approximated by computation based on linear order and recency. No grammatical parallelism is recognized. 
. 	Equivalence classes correspond to merged entity objects whose 'current' positions are always the most recent mentions. 
8. Candidates 	are deterministically ordered, so no decision procedure is needed. 
Given how little syntactic information is used in FASTUS reference resolution, the 71% accuracy in pronoun resolution is perhaps unexpectedly high. This perhaps shows that linear ordering and re-cency are major indicators of salience, especially because grammatical functions correspond to con- stituent ordering in English. The lack of disjoint reference filter is not the most frequent source of errors, and a coarse-grained treatment of reflexives does not hurt very much, mainly because of the in- frequency of reflexives. 


An Example Analysis 
In the IE context, the task of entity reference res- olution is to recognize referential links among par- tially described entities within and across docu-ments, which goes beyond third-person pronouns and identity of reference. The expression types to be handled include bare nominals, possessed nomi- nals, and indefinites, whose referential links tend to be more 'accidental' than textually signaled, and the referential links to be recognized include sub- set, membership, and part-whole. 
Consider one of the five articles evaluated, the one with the most number and variety of referential links, for which FASTUS's performance was the poorest. Even for the 'core' anaphoric expressions of 20 definites, 14 pronouns, and 7 names limited 50

to coreference, for which the code was prepared, the recall was only 51%. 
Figure 1 shows this article annotated with ref- erential indices. The same index indicates corefer- ence. Index subscripts (such as 4a) indicate subset, part, or membership of another expression (e.g., indexed 4). The index number ordering, 1,...,N, has no significance. Each sentence in the TEXT region is numbered with paragraph and sentence numbers, so, for instance, 2-1 is the first sentence in the second paragraph. 
Note that not all of these referential links need be recognized for each particular IE application. However, since reference resolution must consider all of the text for any particular application for the reason mentioned above, it is reasonable to assume that an ideal domain-independent reference resolu- tion component should be able to recognize all of these. Is this a realistic goal, especially in an IE context? This question is left open for now. 
Error Analysis Table 3 shows the system's performance in recog- nizing the referential links in this article, grouped by referring expression types. These exclude the initial mention of each referential chain. Notable sources of errors and necessary extensions are sum- marized for each expression type here. 
Pronouns: Of the four pronoun resolution errors, one is due to a parse error (American in 7-1 was incorrectly parsed as a person entity, to which she in 8-1 was resolved), that in 6-2 is a discourse deixis (Webber, 1988), beyond the scope of the current approach, and two errors (it in 3-1 and its in 7-1) were due to the left-right ordering of intrasentential candidates. Recognition of par- 51 allelism among clause conjuncts and a stricter locality preference for possessive pronouns may help here. 
Definites: Of the fifteen incorrect resolutions of definites, five have nonidentity referential rela- tionships, and hence were not handled. These nonidentity cases must be handled to avoid er- roneous identity-only resolutions. Two errors were due to the failure to distinguish between generic and specific events. Token-referring def- inites (the union in 8-2 and the company in 9-1) were incorrectly resolved to recently mentioned types. Three errors were due to the failure to recognize synonyms between, for example, call (3-2) vs. request (3-1) and campaign (9-1) vs. strategy (9-1). Other error sources are a failure in recognizing an appositive pattern (9-1), the left-right ordering of the candidates in the pre- vious sentence (9-2), and three 'bugs'. 
Proper Names: Name alias recognition was un- usually poor (2 out of 7) because American was parsed as a person-denoting noun. The lower-case print in Patt gibbs also made it difficult to link it with Ms. Gibbs. Such parse errors and input anomalies hurt performance. 
Bare Nominals: Since bare nominaJs were not explicitly resolved, the only correct resolutions (3 out of 12) were due to recognition of ap- positive patterns. How can the other cases be treated? We need to understand the discourse semantics of bare nominMs better before devel- oping an effective algorithm. 
Possessed Nominals: A systematic treatment of possessed nominals is a necessary extension. The basic algorithm will look like this--resolve the possessor entity A of the possessed nominal ASs B, then if there is already an entity of type B associated with A mentioned anywhere in the preceding text, then this is the referent of B. Pos-sessed nominal resolution also requires a 'syn-onymy' computation to resolve, for example, its battle (9-1) to its corporate campaign (7-1). It also needs 'inferences' that rely on multiple suc- cessful resolutions. For instance, her members in 8-1 must first resolve her to Ms. Gibbs, who

3-1 	The president5 of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants4a, which represents Americanl's more than 10,000 flight attendantsl~, called the requests for mediationl~ "premature" and characterized its as a bargaining tactic that could lead to a lockout. 
3-2 	Patt gibbss, presidents of the association4a, said talks2b with the company1 seemed to be progressing well and the calls for mediation15 came as a surprise. 
4-1 The major outstanding issue in the negotiations2b with the flight attendants17 is a two-tier wage scale, in which recent employees' salaries increase on a different scale than the salaries of employees who have worked at american1 for a longer time.

tion' is the Association of Professional Flight At- 
tendants. After it is understood as 'the members 
of the Association of Professional Flight Atten- 
dants,' the coreference with the flight attendants 
can be inferred. Similarly for our women in 8-1. 


Indefinites: Some indefinites are 'coreferential' to generic types, for example, a corporate campaign (7-2, 8-1). Given the difficulty in distinguishing between generic and specific event descriptions, it is unclear whether it will ever be treated in a systematic way. 

Conclusions 

In an operational end-to-end discourse understand- ing system, a reference resolution component must work with input data containing parse errors, lex- icon gaps, and mistakes made by earlier reference resolution. In a state-of-the-art IE system such as SRI's FASTUS, reference resolution must work with considerably impoverished syntactic analysis of the input sentences. The present reference res- olution approach within an IE system is robust and efficient, and performs pronoun resolution to an almost comparable level with a high-accuracy algorithm in the literature. Desirable extensions include nonidentity referential relationships, treat- ments of bare nominals, possessed nominals, and indefinites, type-token distinctions, and recogni-tion of synonyms. Another future direction is to turn this component into a corpus-based statisti- cal approach using the relevant factors identified in the rule-based approach. The need for a large tagged corpus may be difficult to satisfy, however.
