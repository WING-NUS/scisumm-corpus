We present an extension of phrase-based statistical machine translation models that enables the straight-forward integration of additional annotation at the word-level - may it be linguistic markup or automatically generated word classes.
In a number of experiments we show that factored translation models lead to better translation performance, both in terms of automatic scores, as well as more grammatical coherence.
