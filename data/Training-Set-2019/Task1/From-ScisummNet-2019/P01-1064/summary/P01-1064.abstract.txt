We propose a statistical method that finds the maximum-probability segmentation of a given text.
This method does not require training data because it estimates probabilities from the given text.
Therefore, it can be applied to any text in any domain.
An experiment showed that the method is more accurate than or at least as accurate as a state-of-the-art text segmentation system.
