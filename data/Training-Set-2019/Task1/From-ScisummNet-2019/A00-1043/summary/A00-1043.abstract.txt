We present a novel sentence reduction system for automatically removing extraneous phrases from sentences that are extracted from a document for summarization purpose.
The system uses multiple sources of knowledge to decide which phrases in an extracted sentence can be removed, including syntactic knowledge, context information, and statistics computed from a corpus which consists of examples written by human professionals.
Reduction can significantly improve the conciseness of automatic summaries.
