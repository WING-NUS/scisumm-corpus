This paper reports some experiments that compare the accuracy and performance of two stochastic parsing systems.
The currently popular Collins parser is a shallow parser whose output contains more detailed semantically relevant information than other such parsers.
The XLE parser is a deep-parsing system that couples a Lexical Functional Grammar to a log-linear disambiguation component and provides much richer representations theory.
We measured the accuracy of both systems against a gold standard of the PARC 700 dependency bank, and also measured their processing times.
