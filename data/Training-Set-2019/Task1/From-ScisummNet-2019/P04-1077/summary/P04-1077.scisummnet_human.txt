Automatic Evaluation Of Machine Translation Quality Using Longest Common Subsequence And Skip-Bigram Statistics
In this paper we describe two new objective automatic evaluation methods for machine translation.
The first method is based on longest common subsequence between a candidate translation and a set of reference translations.
Longest common subsequence takes into account sentence level structure similarity naturally and identifies longest co-occurring in-sequence n-grams automatically.
The second method relaxes strict n-gram matching to skip-bigram matching.
Skip-bigram is any pair of words in their sentence order.
Skip-bigram co-occurrence statistics measure the overlap of skip-bigrams between a candidate translation and a set of reference translations.
The empirical results show that both methods correlate with human judgments very well in both adequacy and fluency.
We experimented with a wide set of metrics, including NIST, WER (Niefen et al, 2000), PER (Tillmann et al, 1997), and variants of ROUGE, BLEU and GTM.
