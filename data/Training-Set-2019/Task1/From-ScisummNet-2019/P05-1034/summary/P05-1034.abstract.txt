We describe a novel approach to statistical machine translation that combines syntactic information in the source language with recent advances in phrasal translation.
This method requires a source language dependency parser, target language word segmentation and an unsupervised word alignment component.
We align a parallel corpus, project the source dependency parse onto the target sentence, extract dependency treelet translation pairs, and train a tree-based ordering model.
We describe an efficient decoder and show that using these tree-based models in combination with conventional SMT models provides a promising approach that incorporates the power of phrasal SMT with the linguistic generality available in a parser.
