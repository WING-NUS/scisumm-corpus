We present a statistical phrase-based translation model that uses hierarchical phrases - phrases that contain subphrases.
The model is formally a synchronous context-free grammar but is learned from a bitext without any syntactic information.
Thus it can be seen as a shift to the formal machinery of syntax-based translation systems without any linguistic commitment.
In our experiments using BLEU as a metric, the hierarchical phrase-based model achieves a relative improvement of 7.5% over Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art phrase-based system.
