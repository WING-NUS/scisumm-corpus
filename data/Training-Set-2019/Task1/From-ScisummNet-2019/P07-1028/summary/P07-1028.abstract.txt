We propose a new, simple model for the automatic induction of selectional preferences, using corpus-based semantic similarity metrics.
Focusing on the task of semantic role labeling, we compute selectional preferences for semantic roles.
In evaluations the similarity-based model shows lower error rates than both Resnik's WordNet-based model and the EM-based clustering model, but has coverage problems.
