Human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive.
Human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not be reused.
We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run.
