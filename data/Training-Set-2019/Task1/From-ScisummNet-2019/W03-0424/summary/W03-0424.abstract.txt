Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems need to integrate a wide variety of information for optimal performance.
This paper demonstrates that a maximum entropy tagger can effectively encode such information and identify named entities with very high accuracy.
The tagger uses features which can be obtained for a variety of languages and works effectively not only for English, but also for other languages such as German and Dutch.
