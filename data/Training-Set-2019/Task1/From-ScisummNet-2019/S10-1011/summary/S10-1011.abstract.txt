This paper presents the description and evaluation framework of SemEval-2010 Word Sense Induction & Disambiguation task, as well as the evaluation results of 26 participating systems.
In this task, participants were required to induce the senses of 100 target words using a training set, and then disambiguate unseen instances of the same words using the induced senses.
System answers were evaluated in: (1) an unsupervised manner by using two clustering evaluation measures, and (2) a supervised manner in a WSD task.
