We improve the quality of paraphrases extracted from parallel corpora by requiring that
phrases and their paraphrases be the same syntactic type.
This is achieved by parsing the English side of a parallel corpus and altering the phrase extraction algorithm to extract phrase labels alongside bilingual phrase pairs.
In order to retain broad coverage of non-constituent phrases, complex syntactic labels are introduced.
A manual evaluation indicates a 19% absolute improvement in paraphrase quality over the baseline method.
