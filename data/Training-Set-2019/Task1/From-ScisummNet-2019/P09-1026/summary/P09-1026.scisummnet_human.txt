Recognizing Stances in Online Debates
This paper presents an unsupervised opinion analysis method for debate-side classification, i.e., recognizing which stance a person is taking in an online debate.
In order to handle the complexities of this genre, we mine the web to learn associations that are indicative of opinion stances in debates.
We combine this knowledge with discourse information, and formulate the debate side classification task as an Integer Linear Programming problem.
Our results show that our method is substantially better than challenging baseline methods.
We define stance as an overall position held by a person toward an object, idea or proposition.
