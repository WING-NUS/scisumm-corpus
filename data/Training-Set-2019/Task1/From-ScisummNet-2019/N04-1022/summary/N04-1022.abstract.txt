We present Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding for statistical machine translation.
This statistical approach aims to minimize expected loss of translation errors under loss functions that measure translation performance.
We describe a hierarchy of loss functions that incorporate different levels of linguistic information from word strings, word-to-word alignments from an MT system, and syntactic structure from parse-trees of source and target language sentences.
We report the performance of the MBR decoders on a Chinese-to-English translation task.
Our results show that MBR decoding can be used to tune statistical MT performance for specific loss functions.
