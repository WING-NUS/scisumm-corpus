This paper presents PARADISE (PARAdigm for Dialogue System Evaluation), a general framework for evaluating spoken dialogue agents.
The framework decouples task requirements from an agent's dialogue behaviors, supports comparisons among dialogue strategies, enables the calculation of performance over subdialogues and whole dialogues, specifies the relative contribution of various factors to performance, and makes it possible to compare agents performing different tasks by normalizing for task complexity.
