In this paper we describe the English Lexical Substitution task for SemEval.
In the task, annotators and systems find an alternative substitute word or phrase for a target word in context.
The task involves both finding the synonyms and disambiguating the context.
Participating systems are free to use any lexical resource.
There is a subtask which requires identifying cases where the word is functioning as part of a multiword in the sentence and detecting what that multiword is.
