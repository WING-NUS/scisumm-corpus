This paper reports on corpus-based research into the relationship between intonational variation and discourse structure.
We examine the effects of speaking style (read versus spontaneous) and of discourse segmentation method (text-alone versus text-and-speech) on the nature of this relationship.
We also compare the acoustic-prosodic features of initial, medial, and final utterances in a discourse segment.
