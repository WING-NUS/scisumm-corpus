Semantic Roles for SMT: A Hybrid Two-Pass Model
We present results on a novel hybrid semantic SMT model that incorporates the strengths of both semantic role labeling and phrase-based statistical machine translation.
The approach avoids major complexity limitations via a two-pass architecture.
The first pass is performed using a conventional phrase-based SMT model.
The second pass is performed by a re-ordering strategy guided by shallow semantic parsers that produce both semantic frame and role labels.
Evaluation on a Wall Street Journal newswire genre test set showed the hybrid model to yield an improvement of roughly half a point in BLEU score over a strong pure phrase-based SMT baseline – to our knowledge, the first successful application of semantic role labeling to SMT.
We perform semantic role labeling on translation output and reordered arguments to maximize the cross-lingual match of the semantic frames between the source sentence and the target translation.
