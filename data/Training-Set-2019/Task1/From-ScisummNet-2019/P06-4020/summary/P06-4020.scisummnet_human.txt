The Second Release Of The RASP System
We describe the new release of the RASP (robust accurate statistical parsing) system, designed for syntactic annotation of free text.
The new version includes a revised and more semantically-motivated output representation, an enhanced grammar and part-of-speech tagger lexicon, and a more flexible and semi-supervised training method for the structural parse ranking model.
We evaluate the released version on the WSJ using a relational evaluation scheme, and describe how the new release allows users to enhance performance using (in-domain) lexical information.
