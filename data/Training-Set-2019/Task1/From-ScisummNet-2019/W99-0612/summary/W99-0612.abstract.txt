Identifying and classifying personal, geographic, institutional or other names in a text is an important task for numerous applications.
This paper describes and evaluates a language-independent bootstrapping algorithm based on iterative learning and re-estimation of contextual and morphological patterns captured in hierarchically smoothed trie models.
The algorithm learns from unannotated text and achieves competitive performance when trained on a very short labelled name list with no other required language-specific information, tokenizers or tools.
