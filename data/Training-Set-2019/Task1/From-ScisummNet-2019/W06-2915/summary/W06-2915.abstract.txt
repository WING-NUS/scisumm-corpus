In this paper we investigate a new problem of identifying the perspective from which a document is written.
By perspective we mean a point of view, for example, from the perspective of Democrats or Republicans.
Can computers learn to identify the perspective of a document?
Not every sentence is written strongly from a perspective.
Can computers learn to identify which sentences strongly convey a particular perspective?
We develop statistical models to capture how perspectives are expressed at the document and sentence levels, and evaluate the proposed models on articles about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The results show that the proposed models successfully learn how perspectives are reflected in word usage and can identify the perspective of a document with high accuracy.
