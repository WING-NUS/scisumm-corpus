Under categorial grammars that have powerful rules like composition, a simple n-word sentence can have exponentially many parses.
Generating all parses is inefficient and obscures whatever true semantic ambiguities are in the input.
This paper addresses the problem for a fairly general form of Combinatory Categorial Grammar, by means of an efficient, correct, and easy to implement normal-form parsing technique.
The parser is proved to find exactly one parse in each semantic equivalence class of allowable parses; that is, spurious ambiguity (as carefully defined) is shown to be both safely and completely eliminated.
