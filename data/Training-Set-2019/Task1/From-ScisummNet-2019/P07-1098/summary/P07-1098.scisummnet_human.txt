Exploiting Syntactic and Shallow Semantic Kernels for Question Answer Classification
We study the impact of syntactic and shallow semantic information in automatic classification of questions and answers and answer re-ranking.
We define (a) new tree structures based on shallow semantics encoded in Predicate Argument Structures (PASs) and (b) new kernel functions to exploit the representational power of such structures with Support Vector Machines.
Our experiments suggest that syntactic information helps tasks such as question/answer classification and that shallow semantics gives remarkable contribution when a reliable set of PASs can be extracted, e.g. from answers.
Our shallow semantic representations, bearing a more compact information, can prevent the sparseness of deep structural approaches and the weakness of BOW models.
