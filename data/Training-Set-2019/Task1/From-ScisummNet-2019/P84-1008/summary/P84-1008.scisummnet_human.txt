Features And Values
The paper discusses the linguistic aspects of a new general purpose facility for computing with features.
The program was developed in connection with the course I taught at the University of Texas in the fall of 1983.
It is a generalized and expanded version of a system that Stuart Shieber originally designed for the PATR-II project at SRI in the spring of 1983 with later modifications by Fernando Pereira and me.
Like its predecessors, the new Texas version of the "DG {directed graph}" package is primarily intended for representing morphological and syntactic information but it may turn out to be very useful for semantic representations too.
We provide examples of feature structures in which a negation operator might be useful.
