D-Theory: Talking About Talking About Trees
Linguists, including computational linguists, have always been fond of talking about trees.
In this paper, we outline a theory of linguistic structure which talks about talking about trees; we call this theory Description theory (D-theory).
While important issues must be resolved before a complete picture of D-theory emerges (and also before we can build programs which utilize it), we believe that this theory will ultimately provide a framework for explaining the syntax and semantics of natural language in a manner which is intrinsically computational.
This paper will focus primarily on one set of motivations for this theory, those engendered by attempts to handle certain syntactic phenomena within the framework of deterministic parsing.
Our D-theory model is powerful in that it allows the right-most daughter of a node to be lowered under a sibling node.
