Unsupervised Learning of Narrative Event Chains
Hand-coded scripts were used in the 1970-80s as knowledge backbones that enabled inference and other NLP tasks requiring deep semantic knowledge.
We propose unsupervised induction of similar schemata called narrative event chains from raw newswire text.
A narrative event chain is a partially ordered set of events related by a common protagonist.
We describe a three step process to learning narrative event chains. The first uses unsupervised distributional methods to learn narrative relations between events sharing coreferring arguments.
The second applies a temporal classifier to partially order the connected events.
Finally, the third prunes and clusters self-contained chains from the space of events.
We introduce two evaluations: the narrative cloze to evaluate event relatedness, and an order coherence task to evaluate narrative order.
We show a 36% improvement over baseline for narrative prediction and 25% for temporal coherence.
We investigate unsupervised learning of narrative event sequences using point wise mutual information (PMI) between syntactic positions.
