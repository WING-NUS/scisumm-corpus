Two Statistical Parsing Models Applied To The Chinese Treebank
This paper presents the first-ever results of applying statistical parsing models to the newly-available Chinese Treebank.
We have employed two models, one extracted and adapted from BBN's SIFT System (Miller et al. , 1998) and a TAG-based parsing model, adapted from (Chiang, 2000).
On sentences with < 40 words, the former model performs at 69% precision, 75% recall, and the latter at 77% precision and 78% recall.
Our parser operates at word-level with the assumption that input sentences are pre-segmented.
