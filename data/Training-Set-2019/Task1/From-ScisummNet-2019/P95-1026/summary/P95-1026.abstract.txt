This paper presents an unsupervised learning algorithm for sense disambiguation that, when trained on unannotated English text, rivals the performance of supervised techniques that require time-consuming hand annotations.
The algorithm is based on two powerful constraints - that words tend to have one sense per discourse and one sense per collocation - exploited in an iterative bootstrapping procedure.
Tested accuracy exceeds 96%.
