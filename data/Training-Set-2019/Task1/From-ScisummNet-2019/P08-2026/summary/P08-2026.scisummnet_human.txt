Self-Training for Biomedical Parsing
Parser self-training is the technique of taking an existing parser, parsing extra data and then creating a second parser by treating the extra data as further training data.
Here we apply this technique to parser adaptation.
In particular, we self-train the standard Charniak/Johnson Penn-Treebank parser using unlabeled biomedical abstracts.
This achieves an f-score of 84.3% on a standard test set of biomedical abstracts from the Genia corpus.
This is a 20% error reduction over the best previous result on biomedical data (80.2% on the same test set).
