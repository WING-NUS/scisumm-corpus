An Unsupervised Approach To Recognizing Discourse Relations
We present an unsupervised approach to recognizing discourse relations of CONTRAST, EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE, CONDITION and ELABORATION that hold between arbitrary spans of texts.
We show that discourse relation classifiers trained on examples that are automatically extracted from massive amounts of text can be used to distinguish between some of these relations with accuracies as high as 93%, even when the relations are not explicitly marked by cue phrases.
We use a pattern based approach to extract instances of discourse relations such as Contrast and Elaboration from unlabeled corpora.
We propose a method to identify discourse relations between text segments using Naive Bayes classifiers trained on a huge corpus.
