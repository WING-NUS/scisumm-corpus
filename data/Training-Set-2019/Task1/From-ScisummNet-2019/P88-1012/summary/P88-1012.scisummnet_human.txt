Interpretation As Abduction
An approach to abductive inference developed in the TACITUS project has resulted in a dramatic simplification of how the problem of interpreting texts is conceptualized.
Its use in solving the local pragmatics problems of reference, compound nominals, syntactic ambiguity, and metonymy is described and illustrated.
It also suggests an elegant and thorough integration of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
