A Probabilistic Earley Parser As A Psycholinguistic Model
In human sentence processing, cognitive load can be defined many ways.
This report considers a definition of cognitive load in terms of the total probability of structural options that have been disconfirmed at some point in a sentence: the surprisal of word wi given its prefix w0...i−1 on a phrase-structural language model.
These loads can be efficiently calculated using a probabilistic Earley parser (Stolcke, 1995) which is interpreted as generating predictions about reading time on a word-by-word basis.
Under grammatical assumptions supported by corpusfrequency data, the operation of Stolcke’s probabilistic Earley parser correctly predicts processing phenomena associated with garden path structural ambiguity and with the subject/object relative asymmetry.
Since the introduction of a parser-based calculation for surprisal, statistical techniques have been become common as models of reading difficulty and linguistic complexity.
