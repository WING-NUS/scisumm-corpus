We propose that ambiguous prepositional phrase attachment can be resolved on the basis of the relative strength of association of the preposition with noun and verb, estimated on the basis of word distribution in a large corpus.
This work suggests that a distributional approach can be effective in resolving parsing problems that apparently call for complex reasoning.
