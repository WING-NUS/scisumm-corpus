Improved Statistical Alignment Models
In this paper, we present and compare various single-word based alignment models for statistical machine translation.
We discuss the five IBM alignment models, the Hidden-Markov alignment model, smoothing techniques and various modifications.
We present different methods to combine alignments.
As evaluation criterion we use the quality of the resulting Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced reference alignment.
We show that models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model lead to significantly better results than the simple models IBM-1 or IBM-2, which are not able to go beyond zero-order dependencies.
The Alignment Error Rate (AER) measures the fraction of links by which the automatic alignment differs from the reference alignment.
