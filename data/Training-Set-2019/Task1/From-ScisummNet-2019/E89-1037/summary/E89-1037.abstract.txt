We sketch and illustrate an approach to machine translation that exploits the potential of simultaneous correspondences between separate levels of linguistic representation, as formalized in the LFG notion of codescriptions.
The approach is illustrated with examples from English, German and French where the source and the target language sentence show noteworthy differences in linguistic analysis.
