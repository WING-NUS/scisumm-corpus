We present a broad coverage Japanese grammar written in the HPSG formalism with MRS semantics.
The grammar is created for use in real world applications, such that robustness and performance issues play an important role.
It is connected to a POS tagging and word segmentation tool.
This grammar is being developed in a multilingual context, requiring MRS structures that are easily comparable across languages.
