Predicting The Semantic Orientation Of Adjectives
We identify and validate from a large corpus constraints from conjunctions on the positive or negative semantic orientation of the conjoined adjectives.
A log-linear regression model uses these constraints to predict whether conjoined adjectives are of same or different orientations, achieving 82% accuracy in this task when each conjunction is considered independently.
Combining the constraints across many adjectives, a clustering algorithm separates the adjectives into groups of different orientations, and finally, adjectives are labeled positive or negative.
Evaluations on real data and simulation experiments indicate high levels of performance: classification precision is more than 90% for adjectives that occur in a modest number of conjunctions in the corpus.
We cluster adjectives into + and - sets based on conjunction constructions, weighted similarity graphs, minimum-cuts, supervised learning and clustering.
