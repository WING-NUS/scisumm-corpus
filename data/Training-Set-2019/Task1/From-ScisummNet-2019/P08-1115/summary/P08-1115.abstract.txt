Word lattice decoding has proven useful in spoken language translation; we argue that it provides a compelling model for translation of text genres, as well. 
We show that prior work in translating lattices using finite state techniques can be naturally extended to more expressive synchronous context-free grammar-based models. 
Additionally, we resolve a significant complication that non-linear word lattice inputs introduce in reordering models. 
Our experiments evaluating the approach demonstrate substantial gains for Chinese-English and Arabic-English translation.
