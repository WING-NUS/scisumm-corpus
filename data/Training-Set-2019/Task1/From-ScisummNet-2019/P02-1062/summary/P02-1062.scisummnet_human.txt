Ranking Algorithms For Named Entity Extraction: Boosting And The Voted Perceptron
This paper describes algorithms which rerank the top N hypotheses from a maximum-entropy tagger, the application being the recovery of named-entity boundaries in a corpus of web data.
The first approach uses a boosting algorithm for ranking problems.
The second approach uses the voted perceptron algorithm.
Both algorithms give comparable, significant improvements over the maximum-entropy baseline.
The voted perceptron algorithm can be considerably more efficient to train, at some cost in computation on test examples.
We describe a mapping from words to word types which groups words with similar orthographic forms into classes.
