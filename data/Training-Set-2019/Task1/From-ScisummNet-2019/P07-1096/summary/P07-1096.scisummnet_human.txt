Guided Learning for Bidirectional Sequence Classification
In this paper, we propose guided learning, a new learning framework for bidirectional sequence classification.
The tasks of learning the order of inference and training the local classifier are dynamically incorporated into a single Perceptron like learning algorithm.
We apply this novel learning algorithm to POS tagging.
It obtains an error rate of 2.67% on the standard PTB test set, which represents 3.3% relative error reduction over the previous best result on the same data set, while using fewer features.
Our model is competitive to CRF in tagging accuracy but requires much less training time.
We develop new algorithms based on the easiet-first strategy and the perceptron algorithm.
