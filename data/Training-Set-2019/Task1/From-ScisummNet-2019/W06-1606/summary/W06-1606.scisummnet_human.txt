SPMT: Statistical Machine Translation With Syntactified Target Language Phrases
We introduce SPMT, a new class of statistical Translation Models that use Syntactified target language Phrases.
The SPMT models outperform a state of the art phrase-based baseline model by 2.64 Bleu points on the NIST 2003 Chinese-English test corpus and 0.28 points on a human-based quality metric that ranks translations on a scale from 1 to 5.
