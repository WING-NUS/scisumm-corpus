We have analyzed 607 sentences of spontaneous human-computer speech data containing repairs, drawn from a total corpus of 10,718 sentences.
We present here criteria and techniques for automatically detecting the presence of a repair, its location, and making the appropriate correction.
The criteria involve integration of knowledge from several sources: pattern matching, syntactic and semantic analysis, and acoustics.
