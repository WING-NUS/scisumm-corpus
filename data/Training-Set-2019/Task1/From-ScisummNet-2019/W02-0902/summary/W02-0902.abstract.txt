This paper presents work on the task of constructing a word-level translation lexicon purely from unrelated mono-lingual corpora.
We combine various clues such as cognates, similar context, preservation of word similarity, and word frequency.
Experimental results for the construction of a German-English noun lexicon are reported.
Noun translation accuracy of 39% scored against a parallel test corpus could be achieved.
