However, the program misidentifies the antecedent of y. In this case (sometimes called error chaining (Walker, 1989)), both x and y are to be scored as wrong, as they both end up in the wrong coreferential chain.</S> | Reference Offset:  NA | Reference Text:  <S sid = NA ssid = NA>The Hobbs algorithm will correctly choose the end as the antecedent for the second it.</S><S sid = NA ssid = NA>However one can and should measure the effects of error chaining, since reporting numbers that correct for error chaining is misleading, but if the error that produced the error chain can be corrected then the algorithm might show a significant improvement.</S> | Discourse Facet:  NA | Annotator: Automatic
