Two Languages Are More Informative Than One
This paper presents a new approach for resolving lexical ambiguities in one language using statistical data on lexical relations in another language.
This approach exploits the differences between mappings of words to senses in different languages.
We concentrate on the problem of target word selection in machine translation, for which the approach is directly applicable, and employ a statistical model for the selection mechanism.
The model was evaluated using two sets of Hebrew and German examples and was found to be very useful for disambiguation.
