Word groupings useful for language processing tasks are increasingly available, as thesauri appear on-line, and as distributional word clustering techniques improve.
However, for many tasks, one is interested in relationships among word senses, not words.
This paper presents a method for automatic sense disambiguafton of nouns appearing within sets of related nouns -- the kind of data one finds in on-line thesauri, or as the output of distributional clustering algorithms.
Disambiguation is performed with respect to WordNet senses, which are fairly fine-gained; however, the method also permits the assignment of higher-level WordNet categories rather than sense labels.
The method is illustrated primarily by example, though results of a more rigorous evaluation are also presented.
