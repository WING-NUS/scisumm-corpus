A Latent Dirichlet Allocation Method for Selectional Preferences
The computation of selectional preferences, the admissible argument values for a relation, is a well-known NLP task with broad applicability. We present LDA-SP, which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences.
By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, LDA-SP combines the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional class-based approaches, it produces human interpretable classes describing each relation’s preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power.
We compare LDA-SP to several state-ofthe-art methods achieving an 85% increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007).
We also evaluate LDA-SP’s effectiveness at filtering improper applications of inference rules, where we show substantial improvement over Pantel et al.’s system (Pantel et al., 2007).
We focus on inferring latent topics and their distributions over multiple arguments and relations (e.g., the subject and direct object of a verb).
