Forest-Based Translation
Among syntax-based translation models, the tree-based approach, which takes as input a parse tree of the source sentence, is a promising direction being faster and simpler than its string-based counterpart.
However, current tree-based systems suffer from a major drawback: they only use the 2-best parse to direct the translation, which potentially introduces translation mistakes due to parsing errors.
We propose a forest-based approach that translates a packed forest of exponentially many parses, which encodes many more alternatives than standard n-best lists.
Large-scale experiments show an absolute improvement of 1.7 BLEU points over the 1-best baseline.
This result is also 0.8 points higher than decoding with 30-best parses, and takes even less time.
At decoding time, we parse the input sentences into trees, and convert them into translation forest by rule pattern matching.
We propose the first direct use of packed forest.
