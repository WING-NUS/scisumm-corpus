Abstract
Morphology and syntax interact considerably
in many languages and language processing
should pay attention to these interdependen-
cies. We analyze the effect of syntactic fea-
tures when used in automatic morphology pre-
diction on four typologically different lan-
guages. We show that predicting morphology
for languages with highly ambiguous word
forms profits from taking the syntactic context
of words into account and results in state-of-
the-art models.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we investigate the interplay between
syntax and morphology with respect to the task of
assigning morphological descriptions (or tags) to
each token of a sentence. Specifically, we examine
the effect of syntactic information when it is inte-
grated into the feature model of a morphological tag-
ger. We test the effect of syntactic features on four
languages ? Czech, German, Hungarian, and Span-
ish ? and find that syntactic features improve our tag-
ger considerably for Czech and German, but not for
Hungarian and Spanish. Our analysis of construc-
tions that show morpho-syntactic agreement sug-
gests that syntactic features are important if the lan-
guage shows frequent word form syncretisms1 that
can be disambiguated by the syntactic context.
The meaning of a sentence is structurally encoded

ambiguous between several different morphological descrip-
tions within its inflection paradigm.
by morphological and syntactic means.2 Different
languages, however, use them to a different extent.
Languages like English encode grammatical infor-
mation (like the subject vs object status of an argu-
ment) via word order, whereas languages like Czech
or Hungarian use different word forms. Automatic
analysis of languages with rich morphology needs
to pay attention to the interaction between morphol-
ogy and syntax in order to arrive at suitable com-
putational models. Linguistic theory (e. g., Bresnan
(2001), Melc?uk (2009)) suggests many interactions
between morphology and syntax. For example, lan-
guages with a case system use different forms of the
same word to mark different syntactic (or seman-
tic) relations (Blake, 2001). In many languages, two
words that participate in a syntactic relation show
covariance in some or all of their morphological fea-
tures (so-called agreement, Corbett (2006)).3
Automatic annotation of morphology assigns
morphological descriptions (e. g., nominative-
singular-masculine) to word forms. It is usually
modeled as a sequence model, often in combination
with part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization
(Collins, 2002; Hajic?, 2004; Smith et al, 2005;
Chrupa?a et al, 2008, and others). Sequence models
achieve high accuracy and coverage but since they
only use linear context they only approximate some
of the underlying hierarchical relationships. As
an example for these hierarchical relationships,

since text-based tools rarely have access to this information.

finite verb agree with respect to their number and person fea-
ture.

Figure 1: Example of a German noun phrase. First and last word agree in number, gender, and case value.
Figure 1 shows a German noun phrase taken from
the German TiGer corpus (Brants et al, 2002).
The two bold-faced words are the determiner and
the head noun of the phrase, and they agree in
their gender, number, and case values. The word
Regionen (regions) is four-way ambiguous for its
case value, which is reduced to a two-way ambi-
guity between nominative and accusative by the
determiner. Further disambiguation would require
information about the syntactic role of the noun
phrase in a sentence. There are 11 tokens between
these two words, which would require a context
window of at least 13 to capture the agreement
relation within a sequence model. Syntactically,
however, as indicated by the dependency tree,
the determiner and the head are linked directly.
The interdependency between morphology and
syntax in the example thus manifests itself in the
morphological disambiguation of a highly syncretic
word form because of its government or agreement
relation to its respective syntactic head/dependents.
Of course, the sequence model is most of the
time a reasonable approximation, because the ma-
jority of noun phrases in the TiGer corpus are not
as long as the example in Figure 1.4 Furthermore,
not all languages show this kind of relationship be-
tween morphological forms and syntactic relation as
demonstrated for German. But taking advantage of
the morphosyntactic dependencies in a language can
give us better models that may even be capable of
handling the more difficult or rare cases. We there-
fore advocate that models for predicting morphology
should be designed with the typological characteris-
tics of a language and its morphosyntactic properties
in mind, and should, where appropriate, integrate

syntactic information in order to better model the
morphosyntactic interdependencies of the language.
In the remainder of the paper, we show empiri-
cally that taking syntactic information into account
produces state-of-the-art models for languages with
a high interdependency between morphology and
syntax. We use a simple setup, where we combine
a morphological tagger and a dependency parser in
a bootstrapping architecture in order to analyze the
effect of syntactic information on the performance
of the morphological tagger (Section 2). Using syn-
tactic features in morphology prediction requires a
syntactically annotated corpus for training a statisti-
cal parser, which may not be available for languages
with few resources. We show in Section 3 that only
very little syntactically annotated data is required to
achieve the improvements. We furthermore expect
that the improved morphological information also
improves parsing performance and present a prelim-
inary experiment in Section 4.
2 Experiments
In this section, we present a series of experiments
that investigate the effect of syntactic information on
the prediction of morphological features. We start
by describing our data sets and the system that we
used for the experiments.
2.1 Languages and Data Sets
We test our hypotheses on four different languages:
Czech, German, Hungarian, and Spanish.
Spanish, a Romance language, and German, a
Germanic language, constitute inflecting languages
that show verbal and nominal morphology, but not
as sophisticated as Czech and Hungarian. As we
will see in the experiments, it is relatively easy to
334
predict the morphological information annotated in
the Spanish data set.
Czech and Hungarian represent languages with
very rich morphological systems both in verbal and
nominal morphological paradigms. They differ sig-
nificantly in the way in which morphological infor-
mation is encoded in word forms. Czech, a Slavic
language, is an inflecting language, where one suf-
fix may signal several different morphological cate-
gories simultaneously (e. g., number, gender, case).
In contrast, Hungarian, a Finno-Ugric language, is
of the agglutinating type, where each morphological
category is marked by its own morpheme.
Both German and Czech show various form syn-
cretisms in their inflection paradigms. Form syn-
cretisms emerge when the same word form is am-
biguous between several different morphological de-
scriptions, and they are a major challenge to auto-
matic morphological analysis. Spanish shows syn-
cretism in the verbal inflection paradigms. In Hun-
garian, form syncretisms are much less frequent.
The case paradigm of Hungarian only shows one
form syncretism between dative and genitive case
(out of about 18 case suffixes).
All languages show agreement between subject
and verb, and within the noun phrase. The word or-
der in Czech and Hungarian is very variable whereas
it is more restrictive in Spanish and German.
As our data, we use the CoNLL 2009 Shared
Task data sets (Hajic? et al, 2009) for Czech and
Spanish. For German, we use the dependency
conversion of the TiGer treebank by Seeker and
Kuhn (2012), splitting it into 40k/5k/5k sentences
for training/development/test. For Hungarian, we
use the Szeged Dependency Treebank (Vincze et al,
2010), with the split of Farkas et al (2012).
2.2 System Description
To test our hypotheses, we implemented a tagger
that assigns full morphological descriptions to each
token in a sentence. The system was inspired by the
morphological tagger included in mate-tools.5 Like
the tagger provided with mate-tools, it is a classifier
that tags each token using the surrounding tokens in
5A collection of language independent, data-driven analysis
tools for lemmatization, pos-tagging, morphological analysis,
and dependency parsing: http://code.google.com/p/mate-tools
its feature model. Models are trained using passive-
aggressive online training (Crammer et al, 2003).
The system makes two passes over each sentence:
The first pass provides predicted tags that are used
as features during the second pass. We also adopted
the idea of a tag filter, which deterministically as-
signs tags for words that always occur with the same
tag in the training data.
For all matters of syntactic annotation in this pa-
per, we use the graph-based dependency parser by
Bohnet (2010), also included in mate-tools. All data
sets are annotated with gold syntactic information,
which is used to train the parsing models.
For our experiments, we use a bootstrapping ap-
proach: the parser uses the output of the morphology
in its feature set, and the morphological tagger we
want to analyze uses the output of the parser as syn-
tactic features. Since it is best to keep the training
setting as similar as possible to the test setting, we
use 10-fold jackknifing to annotate our training data
with predicted morphology or syntax respectively.
Jackknifing differs from cross-validation only in
its purpose. Cross-validation is used for evaluating
data, jackknifing is used to annotate data. The data
set is split into n parts, and n-1 parts are used to train
a model for annotating the nth part. This is then
rotated n times such that each part is annotated by
the automatic tool without training it on its own test
data. Jackknifing is important for creating a realis-
tic training scenario that provides automatic prepro-
cessing. For annotating development and test sets,
models are trained on the jackknifed training set.
2.3 The Effects of Syntactic Features
In the first experiment, we use the system described
in Section 2.2 to predict morphological information
on all four languages. We start with describing the
general setup and the feature set, and continue with
a discussion of the results.
The experimental setup is as follows: the German
and Spanish data sets are annotated with lemma and
part-of-speech information using 10-fold jackknif-
ing. The annotation is done with mate-tools? lem-
matizer and pos-tagger. For Czech and Hungarian,
we keep the annotation provided with the data sets.
Note that our experimental setup does not include
lemmas or part-of-speech tags as part of the predic-
tion of the morphology but annotates them in a pre-
335
processing step. It is not necessary to separate part-
of-speech and lemma from the prediction of mor-
phology and, in fact, many systems perform these
steps simultaneously (e. g. Spoustova? et al (2009)).
Doing morphology prediction as a separate step al-
lows us to use lemma and part-of-speech informa-
tion in the feature set.6

phological tag predicted by the system, 1b/1a means 1
token before/after the current token, and + marks feature
conjunctions. number marks if the form contains a digit.
After preprocessing the data, our baseline system
is trained using the feature set shown in Table 1. The
baseline system does not make use of any syntactic
information but predicts morphological information
based solely on tokens and their linear context. The
features are divided into static features, which can be
computed on the input, and dynamic features, which
are computed also on previous output of the system
(cf. two passes in Section 2.2).
6Lemma and part-of-speech prediction may also profit from
syntactic information, see e.g. Prins (2004) or Bohnet and Nivre
(2012).
The feature sets in Table 1 were developed specif-
ically for our experiments and are the result of an
automatic forward/backward feature selection pro-
cess. The purpose of the feature selection was to ar-
rive at a baseline system that performs well without
any syntactic information. With such an optimized
baseline system, we can measure the contribution of
syntactic features more reliably.
The last-verb/next-verb and pos+case features are
variants of the features proposed in Votrubec (2006).
They extract information about the first verb within
the last 10/the next 30 tokens in the sentence. The
case feature extracts the case value from previously
assigned morphological tags. Note that the verb
features are approximating syntactic information by
making the assumption that the closest verbs are
likely to be syntactic heads for many words.

Table 2: Syntactic features. h and ld mark features from
the head and the left-most daughter, dir is a binary fea-
ture marking the direction of the head with respect to the
current token.
After training the baseline models, we use them to
annotate the whole data set with morphological in-
formation (using 10-fold jackknifing for the training
portions). We then use 10-fold jackknifing again to
annotate the data sets with the dependency parser.
At this point, all our data sets are annotated with
predicted morphology from our baseline system and
with syntactic information from the parser, which
uses the morphological information from our base-
line system in its feature set. We can now retrain our
morphological tagger using features that are derived
from the dependency trees provided by the parser.
Note that this is not a stacking architecture, since
the second system does not use the predicted mor-
phology output from the baseline system. The loop
simply ensures that we get the best possible syntac-
tic features.
We extract two kinds of syntactic features: fea-
tures of the syntactic head of the current token, and

features of the left-most daughter of the current to-
ken. We also experimented with other types, e. g.
the right-most daughter, but these features did not
improve the model. This is likely due to the way
these languages encode morphological information
and may be different for other languages. From the
head and the left-most daughter, we construct fea-
tures about form, lemma, affixes, and tags. Table 2
lists the syntactic features that we use in the model.
With the syntactic features available due to the
parsing step, we train new models with the full sys-
tem. For each language, we run four experiments.
The first two are baseline experiments, where we
use the off-the-shelf morphological tagger morfette
(Chrupa?a et al, 2008) and our own baseline sys-
tem, both of which do not use any syntactic features.
In the third experiment, we evaluate our full system
using the syntactic features provided by the depen-
dency parser. As an oracle experiment, we also re-
port results on the full system when using the gold
standard syntax from the treebank. Table 3 presents

and out-of-vocabulary tokens only (oov). Out-of-
vocabulary tokens do not occur in the training data.
We find trends along several axes: Generally, the
syntactic features work well for Czech and Ger-
man, whereas for Hungarian and Spanish, they do
not yield any significant improvement. The im-
provements for German and Czech are between 0.5
(Czech) and 1.0 (German) percentage points abso-
lute in token accuracy, and between 0.2 (Czech test
set) and 2.5 (German dev set) percentage points ab-
solute in accuracy of unknown words. There are no
obvious differences between the development and
the test set in any of the languages.
Compared to the morfette baseline, we find our
systems to be either superior or equal to morfette in
terms of token accuracy. Regarding accuracy on un-
known words, morfette outperforms our systems for
Hungarian, but is outperformed on Czech and Ger-
man. For Spanish, all systems yield similar results.
Looking at the oracle experiment, we see that for
all languages, the system can learn something from
syntax. For Czech and German, this is clearly the
337
case, for Hungarian and Spanish, the differences are
small but visible. There are pronounced differences
between the predicted and the gold syntax experi-
ments in Czech and German. Clearly, the parser
makes mistakes that propagate through to the pre-
diction of the morphology.
2.4 Syntax vs Lexicon
The current state-of-the-art in predicting morpho-
logical features makes use of morphological lexi-
cons (e.g. Hajic? (2000), Hakkani-Tu?r et al (2002),
Hajic? (2004)). Lexicons define the possible morpho-
logical descriptions of a word and a statistical model
selects the most probable one among them. In the
following experiment, we test whether the contribu-
tion of syntactic features is similar or different to the
contribution of morphological lexicons.
Lexicons encode important knowledge that is dif-
ficult to pick up in a purely statistical system, e. g.
the gender of nouns, which often cannot be deduced
from the word form (Corbett, 1991).7
We extend our system from the previous experi-
ment to include information from a morphological
dictionaries. For Czech, we use the morphologi-
cal analyzer distributed with the Prague Dependency
Treebank 2 (Hajic? et al, 2006). For German, we
use DMor (Schiller, 1994). For Hungarian, we use
(Tro?n et al, 2006), and for Spanish, we use the mor-
phological analyzer included in Freeling (Carreras et
al., 2004). The output of the analyzers is given to the
system as features that simply record the presence of
a particular morphological analysis for the current
word. The system can thus use the output of any
tool regardless of its annotation scheme, especially
if the annotation scheme of the treebank is different
from the one of the morphological analyzer.
Table 4 presents the results of experiments where
we add the output of the morphological analyzers
to our system. Again, we run experiments with and
without syntactic features. For Czech, we also show
results from featurama8 with the feature set devel-
oped by Votrubec (2006). For German, we show re-
sults for RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008).
As expected, the information from the morpho-
logical lexicon improves the overall performance
7Lexicons are also often used to speed up processing con-
siderably by restricting the search space of the statistical model.

considerably compared to the results in Table 3, es-
pecially on unknown tokens. This shows that even
with the considerable amounts of training data avail-
able nowadays, rule-based morphological analyzers
are important resources for morphological descrip-
tion (cf. Hajic? (2000)). The contribution of syn-
tactic features in German and Czech is almost the
same as in the previous experiment, indicating that
the syntactic features contribute information that is
orthogonal to that of the morphological lexicon. The
lexicon provides lexical knowledge about a word
form, while the syntactic features provide the syn-
tactic context that is needed in German and Czech
to decide on the right morphological tag.
2.5 Language Differences
From the previous experiments, we conclude that
syntactic features help in the prediction of morphol-
ogy for Czech and German, but not for Hungarian
and Spanish. To further investigate the difference
between Czech and German on the one hand, and
Hungarian and Spanish on the other, we take a closer
look at the output of the tagger.
We find an interesting difference between the
two pairs of languages, namely the performance
with respect to agreement. Agreement is a phe-
nomenon where morphology and syntax strongly in-
teract. Morphological features co-vary between two
items in the sentence, but the relation between these
items can occur at various linguistic levels (Corbett,
2006). If the syntactic information helps with pre-
dicting morphological information, we expect this
to be particularly helpful with getting agreement
right. All languages show agreement to some ex-
tent. Specifically, all languages show agreement in
number (and person) between the subject and the
verb of a clause. Czech, German, and Spanish show
agreement in number, gender, and case (not Span-
ish) within a noun phrase. Hungarian shows case
agreement within the noun phrase only rarely, e.g.
for attributively used demonstrative pronouns.
In order to test the effect on agreement, we mea-
sure the accuracy on tokens that are in an agreement
relation with their syntactic head. We counted sub-
ject verb agreement as well as agreement with re-
spect to number, gender, and case (where applicable)
between a noun and its dependent adjective and de-
terminer. Table 5 displays the counts from the devel-
338
opment sets of each language. We compare the base-
line system that does not use any syntactic informa-
tion with the output of the morphological tagger that
uses the gold syntax. We use the gold syntax rather
than the predicted one in order to eliminate any in-
fluence from parsing errors. As can be seen from the
results, the level of agreement relations in Czech and
German improves when using syntactic information,
whereas in Spanish and Hungarian, only very tiny
changes occur.

Table 5: Agreement counts in morphological annotation
compared between the baseline system and the oracle
system using gold syntax.
For Czech and German, these results sugguest
that syntactic information helps with agreement. We
believe that the reasons why it does not help for
Hungarian and Spanish are the following: for Span-
ish, we see that also the baseline model achieves
very high accuracies (cf. Table 3) and also high rates
of correct agreement. It seems that for Spanish, syn-
tactic context is simply not necessary to make the
correct prediction. For Hungarian, the reason lies
within the inflectional paradigms of the language,
which do not show any form syncretism, mean-
ing that word forms in Hungarian are usually not
ambiguous within one morphological category (e.g.
case). Making a morphological tag prediction, how-
ever, is difficult only if the word form itself is am-
biguous between several morphological tags. In this
case, using the agreement relation between the word
and its syntactic head can help the system making
the proper prediction. This is the situation that we
find in Czech and German, where form syncretism
is pervasive in the inflectional paradigms.
2.6 Syntactic Features in Czech
In Section 2.4 we compared the performance of our
system on Czech to another system, featurama (see
Table 4). Featurama outperforms our baseline sys-
tem by a percentage point in token accuracy (and
even more for unknown tokens). Syntactic informa-
tion closes that gap to a large extent but only using
gold syntax gets our system on a par with featurama.
The question then arises whether the syntactic
features actually contribute something new to the
task, or whether the same effect could also be
achieved with linear context features alone as in fea-
turama. In order to test this we run an additional
experiment, where we add some of the syntax fea-
tures to the feature set of featurama. Specifically,
we add the static features from Table 2 that do not
use lemma or part-of-speech information. Due to the
way featurama works, we cannot use features from
the morphological tags (the dynamic features).
The results in Table 6 show that also featurama
profits from syntactic features, which corroborates
the findings from the previous experiments. We also
note again that better syntax would improve results
even more.

3 How Much Syntax is Needed?
Syntactic features require syntactically annotated
corpora. Without a treebank to train the parser, the
morphology cannot profit from syntactic features.9
This may be problematic for languages for which
there is no treebank, because creating a treebank is
expensive. Fortunately, it turns out that very small
amounts of syntactically annotated data are enough
9Which is of course only a problem for statistical parsers.

to provide a parsing quality that is sufficient for the
morphological tagger.
In order to test what amount of training data is
needed, we train several parsing models on increas-
ing amounts of syntactically annotated data. For ex-
ample, the first experiment uses the first 1,000 sen-
tences of the treebank. We perform 5-fold jackknif-
ing with the parser on these sentences to annotate
them with syntax. Then we train one parsing model
on these 1,000 sentences and use it to annotate the
rest of the training data as well as the development
and the test set. This gives us the full data set an-
notated with syntax that was learned from the first
1,000 sentences of the treebank. The morphologi-
cal tagger is then trained on the full training set and
applied to development and test set.
Figure 2 shows the dependency between the
amount of training data given to the parser and the
quality of the morphological tagger using syntac-
tic features provided by this parser. The left-most
point corresponds to a model that does not use syn-
tactic information. For both languages, German
and Czech, we find that already 1,000 sentences are
enough training data for the parser to provide useful
syntactic information to the morphological tagger.
After 5,000 sentences, both curves flatten out and
stay on the same level. We conclude that using syn-
tactic features for morphological prediction is viable
even if there is only small amounts of syntactic data
available to train the parser.
As a related experiment, we also test if we can get
the same effect with a very simple and thus much
faster parser. We use the brute-force algorithm de-
scribed in Covington (2001), which selects for each
token in the sentence another token as the head. It
does not have any tree requirements, so it is not even
guaranteed to yield a cycle-free tree structure. In Ta-
ble 7, we compare the simple parser with the mate-
parser, both trained on the first 5,000 sentences of
the treebank. Evaluation is done in terms of labeled
(LAS) and unlabeled attachment score (UAS).10

As expected, the simple parser performs much
worse in terms of syntactic quality. Table 8 shows
the performance of the morphological tagger when
using the output of both parsers as syntactic fea-
tures. For Czech, both parsers seem to supply sim-
ilar information to the morphological tagger, while
for German, using the full parser is clearly better.
In both cases, the morphological tagger outperforms
the models that do not use syntactic information (cf.
Table 3). The performance on unknown words is
however much worse for both languages. We con-
clude that even with a simple parser and little train-
ing data, the morphology can make use of syntactic
information to some extent.

4 Does Better Morphology lead to Better
Parses?
In the previous sections, we show that syntactic in-
formation improves a model for predicting morphol-
ogy for Czech and German, where syntax and mor-
phology interact considerably. A natural question
then is whether the improvement also occurs in the
other direction, namely whether the improved mor-
phology also leads to better parsing models.
In the previous experiments, we run a 10-fold
jackknifing process to annotate the training data with
morphological information using no syntactic fea-
tures and afterwards use jackknifing with the parser
to annotate syntax. The syntax is subsequently used
as features for our predicted-syntax experiments.
We can apply the same process once more with the
morphology prediction in order to annotate the train-
ing data with morphological information that is pre-
dicted using the syntactic features. A parser trained
on this data will then use the improved morphology
as features. If the improved morphology has an im-
pact on the parser, the quality of the second parsing
model should then be superior to the first parsing
model, which uses the morphology predicted with-
out syntactic information. Note that for the follow-
ing experiments, neither morphology model uses the
morphological lexicon.
Table 9 presents the evaluation of the two pars-
ing models (one using morphology without syntactic
features, the other one using the improved morphol-
ogy). The results show no improvement in parsing
performance when using the improved morphology.
Looking closer at the output, we find differences be-

tween the two parsing models with respect to gram-
matical functions that are morphologically marked.
For example, in German, performance on subjects
and accusative objects improves while performance
for dative objects and genitives decreases. This sug-
gests different strengths in the two parsing models.
However, the question how to make use of the im-
proved morphology in parsing clearly needs more
research in the future. A promising avenue may be
the approach by Hohensee and Bender (2012).
5 Related Work
Morphological taggers have been developed for
many languages. The most common approach is the
combination of a morphological lexicon with a sta-
tistical disambiguation model (Hakkani-Tu?r et al,
2002; Hajic?, 2004; Smith et al, 2005; Spoustova?
et al, 2009; Zsibrita et al, 2013).
Our work has been inspired by Versley et al
(2010), who annotate a treebank with morphologi-
cal information after the syntax had been annotated
already. The system used a finite-state morphology
to propose a set of candidate tags for each word,
which is then further restricted using hand-crafted
rules over the already available syntax tree.
Lee et al (2011) pursue the idea of jointly predict-
ing syntax and morphology, out of the motivation
that joint models should model the problem more
faithfully. They demonstrate that both sides can use
information from each other. However, their model
is computationally quite demanding and its overall
performance falls far behind the standard pipeline
approach where both tasks are done in sequence.
The problem of modeling the interaction between
morphology and syntax has recently attracted some
attention in the SPMRL workshops (Tsarfaty et al,
341
2010). Modeling morphosyntactic relations explic-
itly has been shown to improve statistical parsing
models (Tsarfaty and Sima?an, 2010; Goldberg and
Elhadad, 2010; Seeker and Kuhn, 2013), but the co-
dependency between morphology and syntax makes
it a difficult problem, and linguistic intuition is often
contradicted by the empirical findings. For example,
Marton et al (2013) show that case information is
the most helpful morphological feature for parsing
Arabic, but only if it is given as gold information,
whereas using case information from an automatic
system may even harm the performance.
Morphologically rich languages pose different
challenges for automatic systems. In this paper, we
work with European languages, where the problem
of predicting morphology can be reduced to a tag-
ging problem. In languages like Arabic, Hebrew,
or Turkish, widespread ambiguity in segmentation
of single words into meaningful morphemes adds an
additional complexity. Given a good segmentation
tool that takes care of this, our approach is appli-
cable to these languages as well. For Hebrew, this
problem has also been addressed by jointly mod-
eling segmentation, morphological prediction, and
syntax (Cohen and Smith, 2007; Goldberg and Tsar-
faty, 2008; Goldberg and Elhadad, 2013).
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we have demonstrated that using syn-
tactic information for predicting morphological in-
formation is helpful if the language shows form syn-
cretism in combination with morphosyntactic phe-
nomena like agreement. A model that uses syntactic
information is superior to a sequence model because
it leverages the syntactic dependencies that may hold
between morphologically dependent words as sug-
gested by linguistic theory. We also showed that
only small amounts of training data for a statistical
parser would be needed to improve the morphologi-
cal tagger. Making use of the improved morphology
in the dependency parser is not straight-forward and
requires more investigation in the future.
Modeling the interaction between morphology
and syntax is important for building successful pars-
ing pipelines for languages with free word order and
rich morphology. Moreover, our experiments show
that paying attention to the individual properties of a
language can help us explain and predict the behav-
ior of automatic tools. Thus, the term ?morpholog-
ically rich language? should be viewed as a broad
term that covers many different languages, whose
differences among each other may be as important as
the difference with languages with a less rich mor-
phology.
