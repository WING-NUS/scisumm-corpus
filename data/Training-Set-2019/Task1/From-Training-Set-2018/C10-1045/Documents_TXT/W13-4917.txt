Abstract
This paper reports on the first shared task on
statistical parsing of morphologically rich lan-
guages (MRLs). The task features data sets
from nine languages, each available both in
constituency and dependency annotation. We
report on the preparation of the data sets, on
the proposed parsing scenarios, and on the eval-
uation metrics for parsing MRLs given dif-
ferent representation types. We present and
analyze parsing results obtained by the task
participants, and then provide an analysis and
comparison of the parsers across languages and
frameworks, reported for gold input as well as
more realistic parsing scenarios.
1 Introduction
Syntactic parsing consists of automatically assigning
to a natural language sentence a representation of
its grammatical structure. Data-driven approaches
to this problem, both for constituency-based and
dependency-based parsing, have seen a surge of inter-
est in the last two decades. These data-driven parsing
approaches obtain state-of-the-art results on the de
facto standard Wall Street Journal data set (Marcus et
al., 1993) of English (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2003;
Charniak and Johnson, 2005; McDonald et al, 2005;
McClosky et al, 2006; Petrov et al, 2006; Nivre et
al., 2007b; Carreras et al, 2008; Finkel et al, 2008;

and provide a foundation on which many tasks oper-
ating on semantic structure (e.g., recognizing textual
entailments) or even discourse structure (coreference,
summarization) crucially depend.
While progress on parsing English ? the main
language of focus for the ACL community ? has in-
spired some advances on other languages, it has not,
by itself, yielded high-quality parsing for other lan-
guages and domains. This holds in particular for mor-
phologically rich languages (MRLs), where impor-
tant information concerning the predicate-argument
structure of sentences is expressed through word for-
mation, rather than constituent-order patterns as is the
case in English and other configurational languages.
MRLs express information concerning the grammati-
cal function of a word and its grammatical relation to
other words at the word level, via phenomena such
as inflectional affixes, pronominal clitics, and so on
(Tsarfaty et al, 2012c).
The non-rigid tree structures and morphological
ambiguity of input words contribute to the challenges
of parsing MRLs. In addition, insufficient language
resources were shown to also contribute to parsing
difficulty (Tsarfaty et al, 2010; Tsarfaty et al, 2012c,
and references therein). These challenges have ini-
tially been addressed by native-speaking experts us-
ing strong in-domain knowledge of the linguistic
phenomena and annotation idiosyncrasies to improve
the accuracy and efficiency of parsing models. More
146
recently, advances in PCFG-LA parsing (Petrov et al,
2006) and language-agnostic data-driven dependency
parsing (McDonald et al, 2005; Nivre et al, 2007b)
have made it possible to reach high accuracy with
classical feature engineering techniques in addition
to, or instead of, language-specific knowledge. With
these recent advances, the time has come for estab-
lishing the state of the art, and assessing strengths
and weaknesses of parsers across different MRLs.
This paper reports on the first shared task on sta-
tistical parsing of morphologically rich languages
(the SPMRL Shared Task), organized in collabora-
tion with the 4th SPMRL meeting and co-located
with the conference on Empirical Methods in Natural
Language Processing (EMNLP). In defining and exe-
cuting this shared task, we pursue several goals. First,
we wish to provide standard training and test sets for
MRLs in different representation types and parsing
scenarios, so that researchers can exploit them for
testing existing parsers across different MRLs. Sec-
ond, we wish to standardize the evaluation protocol
and metrics on morphologically ambiguous input,
an under-studied challenge, which is also present in
English when parsing speech data or web-based non-
standard texts. Finally, we aim to raise the awareness
of the community to the challenges of parsing MRLs
and to provide a set of strong baseline results for
further improvement.
The task features data from nine, typologically di-
verse, languages. Unlike previous shared tasks on
parsing, we include data in both dependency-based
and constituency-based formats, and in addition to
the full data setup (complete training data), we pro-
vide a small setup (a training subset of 5,000 sen-
tences). We provide three parsing scenarios: one in
which gold segmentation, POS tags, and morphologi-
cal features are provided, one in which segmentation,
POS tags, and features are automatically predicted
by an external resource, and one in which we provide
a lattice of multiple possible morphological analyses
and allow for joint disambiguation of the morpholog-
ical analysis and syntactic structure. These scenarios
allow us to obtain the performance upper bound of
the systems in lab settings using gold input, as well
as the expected level of performance in realistic pars-
ing scenarios ? where the parser follows a morpho-
logical analyzer and is a part of a full-fledged NLP
pipeline.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
We first survey previous work on parsing MRLs (?2)
and provide a detailed description of the present task,
parsing scenarios, and evaluation metrics (?3). We
then describe the data sets for the nine languages
(?4), present the different systems (?5), and empiri-
cal results (?6). Then, we compare the systems along
different axes (?7) in order to analyze their strengths
and weaknesses. Finally, we summarize and con-
clude with challenges to address in future shared
tasks (?8).
2 Background
2.1 A Brief History of the SPMRL Field
Statistical parsing saw initial success upon the avail-
ability of the Penn Treebank (PTB, Marcus et al,
1994). With that large set of syntactically annotated
sentences at their disposal, researchers could apply
advanced statistical modeling and machine learning
techniques in order to obtain high quality structure
prediction. The first statistical parsing models were
generative and based on treebank grammars (Char-
niak, 1997; Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003;
Collins, 2003; Petrov et al, 2006; McClosky et al,
2006), leading to high phrase-structure accuracy.
Encouraged by the success of phrase-structure
parsers for English, treebank grammars for additional
languages have been developed, starting with Czech
(Hajic? et al, 2000) then with treebanks of Chinese
(Levy and Manning, 2003), Arabic (Maamouri et
al., 2004b), German (K?bler et al, 2006), French
(Abeill? et al, 2003), Hebrew (Sima?an et al, 2001),
Italian (Corazza et al, 2004), Spanish (Moreno et al,
2000), and more. It quickly became apparent that
applying the phrase-based treebank grammar tech-
niques is sensitive to language and annotation prop-
erties, and that these models are not easily portable
across languages and schemes. An exception to that
is the approach by Petrov (2009), who trained latent-
annotation treebank grammars and reported good
accuracy on a range of languages.
The CoNLL shared tasks on dependency parsing
(Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al, 2007a) high-
lighted the usefulness of an alternative linguistic for-
malism for the development of competitive parsing
models. Dependency relations are marked between
input tokens directly, and allow the annotation of
147
non-projective dependencies that are parseable effi-
ciently. Dependency syntax was applied to the de-
scription of different types of languages (Tesni?re,
1959; Mel?c?uk, 2001), which raised the hope that in
these settings, parsing MRLs will further improve.
However, the 2007 shared task organizers (Nivre
et al, 2007a) concluded that: "[Performance] classes
are more easily definable via language characteris-
tics than via characteristics of the data sets. The
split goes across training set size, original data for-
mat [...], sentence length, percentage of unknown
words, number of dependency labels, and ratio of
(C)POSTAGS and dependency labels. The class
with the highest top scores contains languages with
a rather impoverished morphology." The problems
with parsing MRLs have thus not been solved by de-
pendency parsing, but rather, the challenge has been
magnified.
The first event to focus on the particular challenges
of parsing MRLs was a dedicated panel discussion
co-located with IWPT 2009.1 Work presented on
Hebrew, Arabic, French, and German made it clear
that researchers working on non-English parsing face
the same overarching challenges: poor lexical cover-
age (due to high level of inflection), poor syntactic
coverage (due to more flexible word ordering), and,
more generally, issues of data sparseness (due to
the lack of large-scale resources). Additionally, new
questions emerged as to the evaluation of parsers in
such languages ? are the word-based metrics used
for English well-equipped to capture performance
across frameworks, or performance in the face of
morphological complexity? This event provoked ac-
tive discussions and led to the establishment of a
series of SPMRL events for the discussion of shared
challenges and cross-fertilization among researchers
working on parsing MRLs.
The body of work on MRLs that was accumulated
through the SPMRL workshops2 and hosting ACL
venues contains new results for Arabic (Attia et al,
2010; Marton et al, 2013a), Basque (Bengoetxea
and Gojenola, 2010), Croatian (Agic et al, 2013),
French (Seddah et al, 2010; Candito and Seddah,
2010; Sigogne et al, 2011), German (Rehbein, 2011),
Hebrew (Tsarfaty and Sima?an, 2010; Goldberg and

Elhadad, 2010a), Hindi (Ambati et al, 2010), Ko-
rean (Chung et al, 2010; Choi and Palmer, 2011) and
Spanish (Le Roux et al, 2012), Tamil (Green et al,
2012), amongst others. The awareness of the model-
ing challenges gave rise to new lines of work on top-
ics such as joint morpho-syntactic processing (Gold-
berg and Tsarfaty, 2008), Relational-Realizational
Parsing (Tsarfaty, 2010), EasyFirst Parsing (Gold-
berg, 2011), PLCFRS parsing (Kallmeyer and Maier,
2013), the use of factored lexica (Green et al, 2013),
the use of bilingual data (Fraser et al, 2013), and
more developments that are currently under way.
With new models and data, and with lingering in-
terest in parsing non-standard English data, questions
begin to emerge, such as: What is the realistic per-
formance of parsing MRLs using today?s methods?
How do the different models compare with one an-
other? How do different representation types deal
with parsing one particular language? Does the suc-
cess of a parsing model on a language correlate with
its representation type and learning method? How to
parse effectively in the face of resource scarcity? The
first step to answering all of these questions is pro-
viding standard sets of comparable size, streamlined
parsing scenarios, and evaluation metrics, which are
our main goals in this SPMRL shared task.
2.2 Where We Are At: The Need for
Cross-Framework, Realistic, Evaluation
Procedures
The present task serves as the first attempt to stan-
dardize the data sets, parsing scenarios, and evalu-
ation metrics for MRL parsing, for the purpose of
gaining insights into parsers? performance across lan-
guages. Ours is not the first cross-linguistic task on
statistical parsing. As mentioned earlier, two previ-
ous CoNLL shared tasks focused on cross-linguistic
dependency parsing and covered thirteen different
languages (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al,
2007a). However, the settings of these tasks, e.g.,
in terms of data set sizes or parsing scenarios, made
it difficult to draw conclusions about strengths and
weaknesses of different systems on parsing MRLs.
A key aspect to consider is the relation between
input tokens and tree terminals. In the standard sta-
tistical parsing setup, every input token is assumed
to be a terminal node in the syntactic parse tree (after
deterministic tokenization of punctuation). In MRLs,
148
morphological processes may have conjoined several
words into a single token. Such tokens need to be seg-
mented and their analyses need to be disambiguated
in order to identify the nodes in the parse tree. In
previous shared tasks on statistical parsing, morpho-
logical information was assumed to be known in ad-
vance in order to make the setup comparable to that
of parsing English. In realistic scenarios, however,
morphological analyses are initially unknown and are
potentially highly ambiguous, so external resources
are used to predict them. Incorrect morphological
disambiguation sets a strict ceiling on the expected
performance of parsers in real-world scenarios. Re-
sults reported for MRLs using gold morphological
information are then, at best, optimistic.
One reason for adopting this less-than-realistic
evaluation scenario in previous tasks has been the
lack of sound metrics for the more realistic scenario.
Standard evaluation metrics assume that the number
of terminals in the parse hypothesis equals the num-
ber of terminals in the gold tree. When the predicted
morphological segmentation leads to a different num-
ber of terminals in the gold and parse trees, standard
metrics such as ParsEval (Black et al, 1991) or At-
tachment Scores (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) fail
to produce a score. In this task, we use TedEval
(Tsarfaty et al, 2012b), a metric recently suggested
for joint morpho-syntactic evaluation, in which nor-
malized tree-edit distance (Bille, 2005) on morpho-
syntactic trees allows us to quantify the success on
the joint task in realistic parsing scenarios.
Finally, the previous tasks focused on dependency
parsing. When providing both constituency-based
and dependency-based tracks, it is interesting to com-
pare results across these frameworks so as to better
understand the differences in performance between
parsers of different types. We are now faced with
an additional question: how can we compare pars-
ing results across different frameworks? Adopting
standard metrics will not suffice as we would be com-
paring apples and oranges. In contrast, TedEval is
defined for both phrase structures and dependency
structures through the use of an intermediate repre-
sentation called function trees (Tsarfaty et al, 2011;
Tsarfaty et al, 2012a). Using TedEval thus allows us
to explore both dependency and constituency parsing
frameworks and meaningfully compare the perfor-
mance of parsers of different types.
3 Defining the Shared-Task
3.1 Input and Output
We define a parser as a structure prediction function
that maps sequences of space-delimited input tokens
(henceforth, tokens) in a language to a set of parse
trees that capture valid morpho-syntactic structures
in that language. In the case of constituency parsing,
the output structures are phrase-structure trees. In de-
pendency parsing, the output consists of dependency
trees. We use the term tree terminals to refer to the
leaves of a phrase-structure tree in the former case
and to the nodes of a dependency tree in the latter.
We assume that input sentences are represented
as sequences of tokens. In general, there may be a
many-to-many relation between input tokens and tree
terminals. Tokens may be identical to the terminals,
as is often the case in English. A token may be
mapped to multiple terminals assigned their own POS
tags (consider, e.g., the token ?isn?t?), as is the case
in some MRLs. Several tokens may be grouped into
a single (virtual) node, as is the case with multiword
expressions (MWEs) (consider ?pomme de terre? for
?potatoe?). This task covers all these cases.
In the standard setup, all tokens are tree terminals.
Here, the task of a parser is to predict a syntactic
analysis in which the tree terminals coincide with the
tokens. Disambiguating the morphological analyses
that are required for parsing corresponds to selecting
the correct POS tag and possibly a set of morpho-
logical features for each terminal. For the languages
Basque, French, German, Hungarian, Korean, Polish,
and Swedish, we assume this standard setup.
In the morphologically complex setup, every token
may be composed of multiple terminals. In this case,
the task of the parser is to predict the sequence of tree
terminals, their POS tags, and a correct tree associ-
ated with this sequence of terminals. Disambiguating
the morphological analysis therefore requires split-
ting the tokens into segments that define the terminals.
For the Semitic languages Arabic and Hebrew, we
assume this morphologically complex setup.
In the multiword expression (MWEs) setup, pro-
vided here for French only, groupings of terminals
are identified as MWEs (non-terminal nodes in con-
stituency trees, marked heads in dependency trees).
Here, the parser is required to predict how terminals
are grouped into MWEs on top of predicting the tree.
149
3.2 Data Sets
The task features nine languages from six language
families, from Germanic languages (Swedish and
German) and Romance (French) to Slavic (Polish),
Koreanic (Korean), Semitic (Arabic, Hebrew), Uralic
(Hungarian), and the language isolate Basque.
These languages cover a wide range of morpho-
logical richness, with Arabic, Basque, and Hebrew
exhibiting a high degree of inflectional and deriva-
tional morphology. The Germanic languages, Ger-
man and Swedish, have greater degrees of phrasal
ordering freedom than English. While French is not
standardly classified as an MRL, it shares MRLs char-
acteristics which pose challenges for parsing, such as
a richer inflectional system than English.
For each contributing language, we provide two
sets of annotated sentences: one annotated with la-
beled phrase-structure trees, and one annotated with
labeled dependency trees. The sentences in the two
representations are aligned at token and POS levels.
Both representations reflect the predicate-argument
structure of the same sentence, but this information
is expressed using different formal terms and thus
results in different tree structures.
Since some of our native data sets are larger than
others, we provide the training set in two sizes: Full
containing all sentences in the standard training set
of the language, and 5k containing the number of
sentences that is equivalent in size to our smallest
training set (5k sentences). For all languages, the data
has been split into sentences, and the sentences are
parsed and evaluated independently of one another.
3.3 Parsing Scenarios
In the shared task, we consider three parsing scenar-
ios, depending on how much of the morphological
information is provided. The scenarios are listed
below, in increasing order of difficulty.
? Gold: In this scenario, the parser is provided
with unambiguous gold morphological segmen-
tation, POS tags, and morphological features for
each input token.
? Predicted: In this scenario, the parser is pro-
vided with disambiguated morphological seg-
mentation. However, the POS tags and mor-
phological features for each input segment are
unknown.

Predicted X 1-best ?
Raw (1-best) 1-best 1-best ?
Raw (all) ? ? ?
Table 1: A summary of the parsing and evaluation sce-
narios. X depicts gold information, ? depicts unknown
information, to be predicted by the system.
? Raw: In this scenario, the parser is provided
with morphologically ambiguous input. The
morphological segmentation, POS tags, and
morphological features for each input token are
unknown.
The Predicted and Raw scenarios require predict-
ing morphological analyses. This may be done using
a language-specific morphological analyzer, or it may
be done jointly with parsing. We provide inputs that
support these different scenarios:
? Predicted: Gold treebank segmentation is given
to the parser. The POS tags assignment and mor-
phological features are automatically predicted
by the parser or by an external resource.
? Raw (1-best): The 1st-best segmentation and
POS tags assignment is predicted by an external
resource and given to the parser.
? Raw (all): All possible segmentations and POS
tags are specified by an external resource. The
parser selects jointly a segmentation and a tree.
An overview of all shown in table 1. For languages
in which terminals equal tokens, only Gold and Pre-
dicted scenarios are considered. For Semitic lan-
guages we further provide input for both Raw (1-
best) and Raw (all) scenarios. 3
3.4 Evaluation Metrics
This task features nine languages, two different repre-
sentation types and three different evaluation scenar-
ios. In order to evaluate the quality of the predicted
structures in the different tracks, we use a combina-
tion of evaluation metrics that allow us to compare
the systems along different axes.
3The raw Arabic lattices were made available later than the
other data. They are now included in the shared task release.
150
In this section, we formally define the different
evaluation metrics and discuss how they support sys-
tem comparison. Throughout this paper, we will be
referring to different evaluation dimensions:
? Cross-Parser Evaluation in Gold/Predicted
Scenarios. Here, we evaluate the results of dif-
ferent parsers on a single data set in the Gold
or Predicted setting. We use standard evalu-
ation metrics for the different types of anal-
yses, that is, ParsEval (Black et al, 1991)
on phrase-structure trees, and Labeled At-
tachment Scores (LAS) (Buchholz and Marsi,
2006) for dependency trees. Since ParsEval is
known to be sensitive to the size and depth of
trees (Rehbein and van Genabith, 2007b), we
also provide the Leaf-Ancestor metric (Samp-
son and Babarczy, 2003), which is less sensitive
to the depth of the phrase-structure hierarchy. In
both scenarios we also provide metrics to evalu-
ate the prediction of MultiWord Expressions.
? Cross-Parser Evaluation in Raw Scenarios.
Here, we evaluate the results of different parsers
on a single data set in scenarios where morpho-
logical segmentation is not known in advance.
When a hypothesized segmentation is not iden-
tical to the gold segmentation, standard evalua-
tion metrics such as ParsEval and Attachment
Scores break down. Therefore, we use TedEval
(Tsarfaty et al, 2012b), which jointly assesses
the quality of the morphological and syntactic
analysis in morphologically-complex scenarios.
? Cross-Framework Evaluation. Here, we com-
pare the results obtained by a dependency parser
and a constituency parser on the same set of sen-
tences. In order to avoid comparing apples and
oranges, we use the unlabeled TedEval metric,
which converts all representation types inter-
nally into the same kind of structures, called
function trees. Here we use TedEval?s cross-
framework protocol (Tsarfaty et al, 2012a),
which accomodates annotation idiosyncrasies.
? Cross-Language Evaluation. Here, we com-
pare parsers for the same representation type
across different languages. Conducting a com-
plete and faithful evaluation across languages
would require a harmonized universal annota-
tion scheme (possibly along the lines of (de
Marneffe and Manning, 2008; McDonald et al,
2013; Tsarfaty, 2013)) or task based evaluation.
As an approximation we use unlabeled TedEval.
Since it is unlabeled, it is not sensitive to label
set size. Since it internally uses function-trees,
it is less sensitive to annotation idiosyncrasies
(e.g., head choice) (Tsarfaty et al, 2011).
The former two dimensions are evaluated on the full
sets. The latter two are evaluated on smaller, compa-
rable, test sets. For completeness, we provide below
the formal definitions and essential modifications of
the evaluation software that we used.
3.4.1 Evaluation Metrics for Phrase Structures
ParsEval The ParsEval metrics (Black et al, 1991)
are evaluation metrics for phrase-structure trees. De-
spite various shortcomings, they are the de-facto stan-
dard for system comparison on phrase-structure pars-
ing, used in many campaigns and shared tasks (e.g.,
(K?bler, 2008; Petrov and McDonald, 2012)). As-
sume that G and H are phrase-structure gold and
hypothesized trees respectively, each of which is rep-
resented by a set of tuples (i, A, j) where A is a
labeled constituent spanning from i to j. Assume
that g is the same as G except that it discards the
root, preterminal, and terminal nodes, likewise for h
and H . The ParsEval scores define the accuracy of
the hypothesis in terms of the normalized size of the
intersection of the constituent sets.
Precision(g, h) = |g?h||h|
Recall(g, h) = |g?h||g|
F1(g, h) = 2?P?RP+R
We evaluate accuracy on phrase-labels ignoring any
further decoration, as it is in standard practices.
Evalb, the standard software that implements Par-
sEval,4 takes a parameter file and ignores the labels
specified therein. As usual, we ignore root and POS
labels. Contrary to the standard practice, we do take
punctuation into account. Note that, as opposed to the
official version, we used the SANCL?2012 version5
modified to actually penalize non-parsed trees.
4http://www.spmrl.org/
spmrl2013-sharedtask-metrics.html/#Evalb
5Modified by Petrov and McDonald (2012) to be less sensi-
tive to punctuation errors.
151
Leaf-Ancestor The Leaf-Ancestor metric (Samp-
son and Babarczy, 2003) measures the similarity be-
tween the path from each terminal node to the root
node in the output tree and the corresponding path
in the gold tree. The path consists of a sequence of
node labels between the terminal node and the root
node, and the similarity of two paths is calculated
by using the Levenshtein distance. This distance is
normalized by path length, and the score of the tree
is an aggregated score of the values for all terminals
in the tree (xt is the leaf-ancestor path of t in tree x).
LA(h, g) =
?
t?yield(g) Lv(ht,gt)/(len(ht)+len(gt))
|yield(g)|
This metric was shown to be less sensitive to dif-
ferences between annotation schemes in (K?bler et
al., 2008), and was shown by Rehbein and van Gen-
abith (2007a) to evaluate trees more faithfully than
ParsEval in the face of certain annotation decisions.
We used the implementation of Wagner (2012).6
3.4.2 Evaluation Metrics for Dependency
Structures
Attachment Scores Labeled and Unlabeled At-
tachment scores have been proposed as evaluation
metrics for dependency parsing in the CoNLL shared
tasks (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al, 2007a)
and have since assumed the role of standard metrics
in multiple shared tasks and independent studies. As-
sume that g, h are gold and hypothesized dependency
trees respectively, each of which is represented by
a set of arcs (i, A, j) where A is a labeled arc from
terminal i to terminal j. Recall that in the gold and
predicted settings, |g| = |h| (because the number of
terminals determines the number of arcs and hence it
is fixed). So Labeled Attachment Score equals preci-
sion and recall, and it is calculated as a normalized
size of the intersection between the sets of gold and
parsed arcs.7
Precision(g, h) = |g?h||g|
Recall(g, h) = |g?h||h|
LAS(g, h) = |g?h||g| =
|g?h|
|h|

3.4.3 Evaluation Metrics for Morpho-Syntactic
Structures
TedEval The TedEval metrics and protocols have
been developed by Tsarfaty et al (2011), Tsarfaty
et al (2012a) and Tsarfaty et al (2012b) for coping
with non-trivial evaluation scenarios, e.g., comparing
parsing results across different frameworks, across
representation theories, and across different morpho-
logical segmentation hypotheses.8 Contrary to the
previous metrics, which view accuracy as a normal-
ized intersection over sets, TedEval computes the ac-
curacy of a parse tree based on the tree-edit distance
between complete trees. Assume a finite set of (pos-
sibly parameterized) edit operations A = {a1....an},
and a cost function c : A ? 1. An edit script is the
cost of a sequence of edit operations, and the edit dis-
tance of g, h is the minimal cost edit script that turns
g into h (and vice versa). The normalized distance
subtracted from 1 provides the level of accuracy on
the task. Formally, the TedEval score on g, h is de-
fined as follows, where ted is the tree-edit distance,
and the |x| (size in nodes) discards terminals and root
nodes.
TedEval(g, h) = 1?
ted(g, h)
|g|+ |h|
In the gold scenario, we are not allowed to manipu-
late terminal nodes, only non-terminals. In the raw
scenarios, we can add and delete both terminals and
non-terminals so as to match both the morphological
and syntactic hypotheses.
3.4.4 Evaluation Metrics for
Multiword-Expression Identification
As pointed out in section 3.1, the French data set is
provided with tree structures encoding both syntactic
information and groupings of terminals into MWEs.
A given MWE is defined as a continuous sequence of
terminals, plus a POS tag. In the constituency trees,
the POS tag of the MWE is an internal node of the
tree, dominating the sequence of pre-terminals, each
dominating a terminal. In the dependency trees, there
is no specific node for the MWE as such (the nodes
are the terminals). So, the first token of a MWE is
taken as the head of the other tokens of the same
MWE, with the same label (see section 4.4).

To evaluate performance on MWEs, we use the
following metrics.
? R_MWE, P_MWE, and F_MWE are recall, pre-
cision, and F-score over full MWEs, in which
a predicted MWE counts as correct if it has the
correct span (same group as in the gold data).
? R_MWE +POS, R_MWE +POS, and F_MWE
+POS are defined in the same fashion, except
that a predicted MWE counts as correct if it has
both correct span and correct POS tag.
? R_COMP, R_COMP, and F_COMP are recall,
precision and F-score over non-head compo-
nents of MWEs: a non-head component of MWE
counts as correct if it is attached to the head of
the MWE, with the specific label that indicates
that it is part of an MWE.
4 The SPMRL 2013 Data Sets
4.1 The Treebanks
We provide data from nine different languages anno-
tated with two representation types: phrase-structure
trees and dependency trees.9 Statistics about size,
average length, label set size, and other character-
istics of the treebanks and schemes are provided in
Table 2. Phrase structures are provided in an ex-
tended bracketed style, that is, Penn Treebank brack-
eted style where every labeled node may be extended
with morphological features expressed. Dependency
structures are provided in the CoNLL-X format.10
For any given language, the dependency and con-
stituency treebanks are aligned at the token and ter-
minal levels and share the same POS tagset and mor-
phological features. That is, any form in the CoNLL
format is a terminal of the respective bracketed tree.
Any CPOS label in the CoNLL format is the pre-
terminal dominating the terminal in the bracketed
tree. The FEATS in the CoNLL format are repre-
sented as dash-features decorated on the respective
pre-terminal node in the bracketed tree. See Fig-
ure 1(a)?1(b) for an illustration of this alignment.
9Additionally, we provided the data in TigerXML format
(Brants et al, 2002) for phrase structure trees containing cross-
ing branches. This allows the use of more powerful parsing
formalisms. Unfortunately, we received no submissions for this
data, hence we discard them in the rest of this overview.
10See http://ilk.uvt.nl/conll/.
For ambiguous morphological analyses, we pro-
vide the mapping of tokens to different segmentation
possibilities through lattice files. See Figure 1(c) for
an illustration, where lattice indices mark the start
and end positions of terminals.
For each of the treebanks, we provide a three-way
dev/train/set split and another train set containing the
first 5k sentences of train (5k). This section provides
the details of the original treebanks and their anno-
tations, our data-set preparation, including prepro-
cessing and data splits, cross-framework alignment,
and the prediction of morphological information in
non-gold scenarios.
4.2 The Arabic Treebanks
Arabic is a morphologically complex language which
has rich inflectional and derivational morphology. It
exhibits a high degree of morphological ambiguity
due to the absence of the diacritics and inconsistent
spelling of letters, such as Alif and Ya. As a conse-
quence, the Buckwalter Standard Arabic Morpholog-
ical Analyzer (Buckwalter, 2004; Graff et al, 2009)
produces an average of 12 analyses per word.
Data Sets The Arabic data set contains two tree-
banks derived from the LDC Penn Arabic Treebanks
(PATB) (Maamouri et al, 2004b):11 the Columbia
Arabic Treebank (CATiB) (Habash and Roth, 2009),
a dependency treebank, and the Stanford version
of the PATB (Green and Manning, 2010), a phrase-
structure treebank. We preprocessed the treebanks
to obtain strict token matching between the treebanks
and the morphological analyses. This required non-
trivial synchronization at the tree token level between
the PATB treebank, the CATiB treebank and the mor-
phologically predicted data, using the PATB source
tokens and CATiB feature word form as a dual syn-
chronized pivot.
The Columbia Arabic Treebank The Columbia
Arabic Treebank (CATiB) uses a dependency repre-
sentation that is based on traditional Arabic grammar
and that emphasizes syntactic case relations (Habash
and Roth, 2009; Habash et al, 2007). The CATiB
treebank uses the word tokenization of the PATB
11The LDC kindly provided their latest version of the Arabic
Treebanks. In particular, we used PATB 1 v4.1 (Maamouri et al,
2005), PATB 2 v3.1 (Maamouri et al, 2004a) and PATB 3 v3.3.

of the gold tree. For brevity, we use empty feature columns, but of course lattice arcs may carry any morphological
features, in the FEATS CoNLL format.
and employs a reduced POS tagset consisting of six
tags only: NOM (non-proper nominals including
nouns, pronouns, adjectives and adverbs), PROP
(proper nouns), VRB (active-voice verbs), VRB-
PASS (passive-voice verbs), PRT (particles such as
prepositions or conjunctions) and PNX (punctuation).
(This stands in extreme contrast with the Buckwalter
Arabic tagset (PATB official tagset) which is almost
500 tags.) To obtain these dependency trees, we used
the constituent-to-dependency tool (Habash and Roth,
2009). Additional CATiB trees were annotated di-
rectly, but we only use the portions that are converted
from phrase-structure representation, to ensure that
the constituent and dependency yields can be aligned.
The Stanford Arabic Phrase Structure Treebank
In order to stay compatible with the state of the art,
we provide the constituency data set with most of the
pre-processing steps of Green and Manning (2010),
as they were shown to improve baseline performance
on the PATB parsing considerably.12
To convert the original PATB to preprocessed
phrase-structure trees ? la Stanford, we first discard
all trees dominated by X, which indicates errors and
non-linguistic text. At the phrasal level, we collapse
unary chains with identical categories like NP? NP.
We finally remove all traces, but, unlike Green and
Manning (2010), we keep all function tags.
In the original Stanford instance, the pre-terminal
morphological analyses were mapped to the short-
ened Bies tag set provided with the treebank (where
Determiner markers, ?DT?, were added to definite
noun and adjectives, resulting in 32 POS tags). Here
we use the Kulick tagset (Kulick et al, 2006) for
12Both the corpus split and pre-processing code are available
with the Stanford parser at http://nlp.stanford.edu/
projects/arabic.shtml.
155
pre-terminal categories in the phrase-structure trees,
where the Bies tag set is included as a morphological
feature (stanpos) in our PATB instance.
Adapting the Data to the Shared Task We con-
verted the CATiB representation to the CoNLL rep-
resentation and added a ?split-from-previous? and
?split-from-next? markers as in LDC?s tree-terminal
fields.
A major difference between the CATiB treebank
and the Stanford treebank lies in the way they han-
dle paragraph annotations. The original PATB con-
tains sequences of annotated trees that belong to a
same discourse unit (e.g., paragraph). While the
CATiB conversion tool considers each sequence a
single parsing unit, the Stanford pre-processor treats
each such tree structure rooted at S, NP or Frag as
a tree spanning a single sentence. To be compati-
ble with the predicted morphology data which was
bootstrapped and trained on the CATiB interpretation,
we deterministically modified the original PATB by
adding pseudo XP root nodes, so that the Stanford
pre-proprecessor will generate the same tree yields
as the CATiB treebank.
Another important aspect of preprocessing (often-
delegated as a technicality in the Arabic parsing lit-
erature) is the normalization of token forms. Most
Arabic parsing work used transliterated text based on
the schemes proposed by Buckwalter (2002). The
transliteration schemes exhibit some small differ-
ences, but enough to increase the out-of-vocabulary
rate by a significant margin (on top of strictly un-
known morphemes). This phenomenon is evident in
the morphological analysis lattices (in the predicted
dev set there is a 6% OOV rate without normalization,
and half a point reduction after normalization is ap-
plied, see (Habash et al, 2009b; Green and Manning,
2010)). This rate is much lower for gold tokenized
predicted data (with an OOV rate of only 3.66%,
similar to French for example). In our data set, all
tokens are minimally normalized: no diacritics, no
normalization.13
Data Splits For the Arabic treebanks, we use the
data split recommended by the Columbia Arabic and
Dialect Modeling (CADiM) group (Diab et al, 2013).
13Except for the minimal normalization present in MADA?s
back-end tools. This script was provided to the participants.
The data of the LDC first three annotated Arabic Tree-
banks (ATB1, ATB2 and ATB3) were divided into
roughly a 10/80/10% dev/train/test split by word vol-
ume. When dividing the corpora, document bound-
aries were maintained. The train5k files are simply
the first 5,000 sentences of the training files.
POS Tagsets Given the richness of Arabic mor-
phology, there are multiple POS tag sets and tokeniza-
tion schemes that have been used by researchers, (see,
e.g., Marton et al (2013a)). In the shared task, we fol-
low the standard PATB tokenization which splits off
several categories of orthographic clitics, but not the
definite article Al+. On top of that, we consider three
different POS tag sets with different degrees of gran-
ularity: the Buckwalter tag set (Buckwalter, 2004),
the Kulick Reduced Tag set (Kulick et al, 2006), and
the CATiB tag set (Habash et al, 2009a), considering
that granularity of the morphological analyses may
affect syntactic processing. For more information see
Habash (2010).
Predicted Morphology To prepare input for the
Raw scenarios (?3.3), we used the MADA+TOKAN
system (Habash et al, 2009b). MADA is a system
for morphological analysis and disambiguation of
Arabic. It can predict the 1-best tokenization, POS
tags, lemmas and diacritization in one fell swoop.
The MADA output was also used to generate the
lattice files for the Raw-all scenario.
To generate input for the gold token / predicted
tag input scenario, we used Morfette (Chrupa?a et al,
2008), a joint lemmatization and POS tagging model
based on an averaged perceptron. We generated two
tagging models, one trained with the Buckwalter tag
set, and the other with the Kulick tag set. Both were
mapped back to the CATiB POS tag set such that all
predicted tags are contained in the feature field.14
4.3 The Basque Treebank
Basque is an agglutinative language with a high ca-
pacity to generate inflected wordforms, with free
constituent order of sentence elements with respect
to the main verb. Contrary to many other treebanks,
the Basque treebank was originally annotated with
dependency trees, which were later on converted to
constituency trees.
14A conversion script from the rich Buckwalter tagset to
CoNLL-like features was provided to the participants.
156
The Basque Dependency Treebank (BDT) is a
dependency treebank in its original design, due to
syntactic characteristics of Basque such as its free
word order. Before the syntactic annotation, mor-
phological analysis was performed, using the Basque
morphological analyzer of Aduriz et al (2000). In
Basque each lemma can generate thousands of word-
forms ? differing in morphological properties such
as case, number, tense, or different types of subordi-
nation for verbs. If only POS category ambiguity is
resolved, the analyses remain highly ambiguous.
For the main POS category, there is an average of
1.55 interpretations per wordform, which rises to 2.65
for the full morpho-syntactic information, resulting
in an overall 64% of ambiguous wordforms. The
correct analysis was then manually chosen.
The syntactic trees were manually assigned. Each
word contains its lemma, main POS category, POS
subcategory, morphological features, and the la-
beled dependency relation. Each form indicates mor-
phosyntactic features such as case, number and type
of subordination, which are relevant for parsing.
The first version of the Basque Dependency Tree-
bank, consisting of 3,700 sentences (Aduriz et al,
2003), was used in the CoNLL 2007 Shared Task on
Dependency Parsing (Nivre et al, 2007a). The cur-
rent shared task uses the second version of the BDT,
which is the result of an extension and redesign of the
original requirements, containing 11,225 sentences
(150,000 tokens).
The Basque Constituency Treebank (BCT) was
created as part of the CESS-ECE project, where the
main aim was to obtain syntactically annotated con-
stituency treebanks for Catalan, Spanish and Basque
using a common set of syntactic categories. BCT
was semi-automatically derived from the dependency
version (Aldezabal et al, 2008). The conversion pro-
duced complete constituency trees for 80% of the
sentences. The main bottlenecks have been sentence
connectors and non-projective dependencies which
could not be straightforwardly converted into projec-
tive tree structures, requiring a mechanism similar to
traces in the Penn English Treebank.
Adapting the Data to the Shared Task As the
BCT did not contain all of the original non-projective
dependency trees, we selected the set of 8,000 match-
ing sentences in both treebanks for the shared task.15
This implies that around 2k trees could not be gen-
erated and therefore were discarded. Furthermore,
the BCT annotation scheme does not contain attach-
ment for most of the punctuation marks, so those
were inserted into the BCT using a simple lower-left
attachment heuristic. The same goes for some con-
nectors that could not be aligned in the first phase.
Predicted Morphology In order to obtain pre-
dicted tags for the non-gold scenarios, we used the
following pipeline. First, morphological analysis as
described above was performed, followed by a dis-
ambiguation step. At that point, it is hard to obtain a
single interpretation for each wordform, as determin-
ing the correct interpretation for each wordform may
require knowledge of long-distance elements on top
of the free constituency order of the main phrasal el-
ements in Basque. The disambiguation is performed
by the module by Ezeiza et al (1998), which uses
a combination of knowledge-based disambiguation,
by means of Constraint Grammar (Karlsson et al,
1995; Aduriz et al, 1997), and a posterior statistical
disambiguation module, using an HMM.16
For the shared task data, we chose a setting that
disambiguates most word forms, and retains ? 97%
of the correct interpretations, leaving an ambiguity
level of 1.3 interpretations. For the remaining cases
of ambiguity, we chose the first interpretation, which
corresponds to the most frequent option. This leaves
open the investigation of more complex approaches
for selecting the most appropriate reading.17
4.4 The French Treebank
French is not a morphologically rich language per se,
though its inflectional system is richer than that of
English, and it also exhibits a limited amount of word
order variation occurring at different syntactic levels
including the word level (e.g. pre- or post-nominal
15We generated a 80/10/10 split, ? train/dev/test ? The first 5k
sentences of the train set were used as a basis for the train5k.
16Note that the statistical module can be parametrized accord-
ing to the level of disambiguation to trade off precision and
recall. For example, disambiguation based on the main cate-
gories (abstracting over morpho-syntactic features) maintains
most of the correct interpretations but still gives an output with
several interpretations per wordform.
17This is not an easy task. The ambiguity left is the hardest to
solve given that the knowledge-based and statistical disambigua-
tion processes have not been able to pick out a single reading.
157
adjective, pre- or post-verbal adverbs) and the phrase
level (e.g. possible alternations between post verbal
NPs and PPs). It also has a high degree of multi-
word expressions, that are often ambiguous with a
literal reading as a sequence of simple words. The
syntactic and MWE analysis shows the same kind of
interaction (though to a lesser extent) as morphologi-
cal and syntactic interaction in Semitic languages ?
MWEs help parsing, and syntactic information may
be required to disambiguate MWE identification.
The Data Set The French data sets were gener-
ated from the French Treebank (Abeill? et al, 2003),
which consists of sentences from the newspaper Le
Monde, manually annotated with phrase structures
and morphological information. Part of the treebank
trees are also annotated with grammatical function
tags for dependents of verbs. In the SPMRL shared
task release, we used only this part, consisting of
18,535 sentences,18 split into 14,759 sentences for
training, 1,235 sentences for development, and 2,541
sentences for the final evaluation.19
Adapting the Data to the Shared Task The con-
stituency trees are provided in an extended PTB
bracketed format, with morphological features at the
pre-terminal level only. They contain slight, auto-
matically performed, modifications with respect to
the original trees of the French treebank. The syntag-
matic projection of prepositions and complementiz-
ers was normalized, in order to have prepositions and
complementizers as heads in the dependency trees
(Candito et al, 2010).
The dependency representations are projective de-
pendency trees, obtained through automatic conver-
sion from the constituency trees. The conversion pro-
cedure is an enhanced version of the one described
by Candito et al (2010).
Both the constituency and the dependency repre-
sentations make use of coarse- and fine-grained POS
tags (CPOS and FPOS respectively). The CPOS are
the categories from the original treebank. The FPOS
18The process of functional annotation is still ongoing, the
objective of the FTB providers being to have all the 20000 sen-
tences annotated with functional tags.
19The first 9,981 training sentences correspond to the canoni-
cal 2007 training set. The development set is the same and the
last 1235 sentences of the test set are those of the canonical test
set.
are merged using the CPOS and specific morphologi-
cal information such as verbal mood, proper/common
noun distinction (Crabb? and Candito, 2008).
Multi-Word Expressions The main difference
with respect to previous releases of the bracketed
or dependency versions of the French treebank
lies in the representation of multi-word expressions
(MWEs). The MWEs appear in an extended format:
each MWE bears an FPOS20 and consists of a se-
quence of terminals (hereafter the ?components? of
the MWE), each having their proper CPOS, FPOS,
lemma and morphological features. Note though that
in the original treebank the only gold information
provided for a MWE component is its CPOS. Since
leaving this information blank for MWE components
would have provided a strong cue for MWE recog-
nition, we made sure to provide the same kind of
information for every terminal, whether MWE com-
ponent or not, by providing predicted morphological
features, lemma, and FPOS for MWE components
(even in the ?gold? section of the data set). This infor-
mation was predicted by the Morfette tool (Chrupa?a
et al, 2008), adapted to French (Seddah et al, 2010).
In the constituency trees, each MWE corresponds
to an internal node whose label is the MWE?s FPOS
suffixed by a +, and which dominates the component
pre-terminal nodes.
In the dependency trees, there is no ?node? for a
MWE as a whole, but one node (a terminal in the
CoNLL format) per MWE component. The first com-
ponent of a MWE is taken as the head of the MWE.
All subsequent components of the MWE depend on
the first one, with the special label dep_cpd. Further-
more, the first MWE component bears a feature mwe-
head equal to the FPOS of the MWE. For instance,
the MWE la veille (the day before) is an adverb, con-
taining a determiner component and a common noun
component. Its bracketed representation is (ADV+
(DET la) (NC veille)), and in the dependency repre-
sentation, the noun veille depends on the determiner
la, which bears the feature mwehead=ADV+.
Predicted Morphology For the predicted mor-
phology scenario, we provide data in which the
mwehead has been removed and with predicted

morphological features pertaining to the MWE itself, though this
information is present in the original trees.

4.5 The German Treebank
German is a fusional language with moderately free
word order, in which verbal elements are fixed in
place and non-verbal elements can be ordered freely
as long as they fulfill the ordering requirements of
the clause (H?hle, 1986).
The Data Set The German constituency data set
is based on the TiGer treebank release 2.2.21 The
original annotation scheme represents discontinuous
constituents such that all arguments of a predicate
are always grouped under a single node regardless of
whether there is intervening material between them
or not (Brants et al, 2002). Furthermore, punctua-
tion and several other elements, such as parentheses,
are not attached to the tree. In order to make the
constituency treebank usable for PCFG parsing, we
adapted this treebank as described shortly.
The conversion of TiGer into dependencies is a
variant of the one by Seeker and Kuhn (2012), which
does not contain empty nodes. It is based on the same
TiGer release as the one used for the constituency
data. Punctuation was attached as high as possible,
without creating any new non-projective edges.
Adapting the Data to the Shared Task For
the constituency version, punctuation and other
unattached elements were first attached to the tree.
As attachment target, we used roughly the respec-
tive least common ancestor node of the right and
left terminal neighbor of the unattached element (see
Maier et al (2012) for details), and subsequently, the
crossing branches were resolved.
This was done in three steps. In the first step, the
head daughters of all nodes were marked using a
simple heuristic. In case there was a daughter with
the edge label HD, this daughter was marked, i.e.,
existing head markings were honored. Otherwise, if
existing, the rightmost daughter with edge label NK
(noun kernel) was marked. Otherwise, as default, the
leftmost daughter was marked. In a second step, for
each continuous part of a discontinuous constituent,
a separate node was introduced. This corresponds
21This version is available from http://www.ims.
uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/
korpora/tiger.html
to the "raising" algorithm described by Boyd (2007).
In a third steps, all those newly introduced nodes
that did not cover the head daughter of the original
discontinuous node were deleted. For the second
and the third step, we used the same script as for the
Swedish constituency data.
Predicted Morphology For the predicted scenario,
a single sequence of POS tags and morphologi-
cal features has been assigned using the MATE
toolchain via a model trained on the train set via cross-
validation on the training set. The MATE toolchain
was used to provide predicted annotation for lem-
mas, POS tags, morphology, and syntax. In order to
achieve the best results for each annotation level, a
10-fold jackknifing was performed to provide realis-
tic features for the higher annotation levels. The pre-
dicted annotation of the 5k training set were copied
from the full data set.22
4.6 The Hebrew Treebank
Modern Hebrew is a Semitic language, characterized
by inflectional and derivational (templatic) morphol-
ogy and relatively free word order. The function
words for from/to/like/and/when/that/the are prefixed
to the next token, causing severe segmentation ambi-
guity for many tokens. In addition, Hebrew orthogra-
phy does not indicate vowels in modern texts, leading
to a very high level of word-form ambiguity.
The Data Set Both the constituency and the de-
pendency data sets are derived from the Hebrew
Treebank V2 (Sima?an et al, 2001; Guthmann et
al., 2009). The treebank is based on just over 6000
sentences from the daily newspaper ?Ha?aretz?, man-
ually annotated with morphological information and
phrase-structure trees and extended with head infor-
mation as described in Tsarfaty (2010, ch. 5). The
unlabeled dependency version was produced by con-
version from the constituency treebank as described
in Goldberg (2011). Both the constituency and depen-
dency trees were annotated with a set grammatical
function labels conforming to Unified Stanford De-
pendencies by Tsarfaty (2013).
22We also provided a predicted-all scenario, in which we
provided morphological analysis lattices with POS and mor-
phological information derived from the analyses of the SMOR
derivational morphology (Schmid et al, 2004). These lattices
were not used by any of the participants.
159
Adapting the Data to the Shared Task While
based on the same trees, the dependency and con-
stituency treebanks differ in their POS tag sets, as
well as in some of the morphological segmentation
decisions. The main effort towards the shared task
was unifying the two resources such that the two tree-
banks share the same lexical yields, and the same
pre-terminal labels. To this end, we took the layering
approach of Goldberg et al (2009), and included two
levels of POS tags in the constituency trees. The
lower level is lexical, conforming to the lexical re-
source used to build the lattices, and is shared by
the two treebanks. The higher level is syntactic, and
follows the tag set and annotation decisions of the
original constituency treebank.23 In addition, we uni-
fied the representation of morphological features, and
fixed inconsistencies and mistakes in the treebanks.
Data Split The Hebrew treebank is one of the
smallest in our language set, and hence it is provided
in only the small (5k) setting. For the sake of com-
parability with the 5k set of the other treebanks, we
created a comparable size of dev/test sets containing
the first and last 500 sentences respectively, where
the rest serve as the 5k training.24
Predicted Morphology The lattices encoding the
morphological ambiguity for the Raw (all) scenario
were produced by looking up the possible analyses
of each input token in the wide-coverage morpholog-
ical analyzer (lexicon) of the Knowledge Center for
Processing Hebrew (Itai and Wintner, 2008; MILA,
2008), with a simple heuristic for dealing with un-
known tokens. A small lattice encoding the possible
analyses of each token was produced separately, and
these token-lattices were concatenated to produce the
sentence lattice. The lattice for a given sentence may
not include the gold analysis in cases of incomplete
lexicon coverage.
The morphologically disambiguated input files for
the Raw (1-best) scenario were produced by run-
ning the raw text through the morphological disam-
23Note that this additional layer in the constituency treebank
adds a relatively easy set of nodes to the trees, thus ?inflating?
the evaluation scores compared to previously reported results.
To compensate, a stricter protocol than is used in this task would
strip one of the two POS layers prior to evaluation.
24This split is slightly different than the split in previous stud-
ies.
biguator (tagger) described in Adler and Elhadad
(2006; Goldberg et al (2008),Adler (2007). The
disambiguator is based on the same lexicon that is
used to produce the lattice files, but utilizes an extra
module for dealing with unknown tokens Adler et al
(2008). The core of the disambiguator is an HMM
tagger trained on about 70M unannotated tokens us-
ing EM, and being supervised by the lexicon.
As in the case of Arabic, we also provided data
for the Predicted (gold token / predicted morphol-
ogy) scenario. We used the same sequence labeler,
Morfette (Chrupa?a et al, 2008), trained on the con-
catenation of POS and morphological gold features,
leading to a model with respectable accuracy.25
4.7 The Hungarian Treebank
Hungarian is an agglutinative language, thus a lemma
can have hundreds of word forms due to derivational
or inflectional affixation (nominal declination and
verbal conjugation). Grammatical information is typ-
ically indicated by suffixes: case suffixes mark the
syntactic relationship between the head and its argu-
ments (subject, object, dative, etc.) whereas verbs
are inflected for tense, mood, person, number, and
the definiteness of the object. Hungarian is also char-
acterized by vowel harmony.26 In addition, there are
several other linguistic phenomena such as causa-
tion and modality that are syntactically expressed in
English but encoded morphologically in Hungarian.
The Data Set The Hungarian data set used in
the shared task is based on the Szeged Treebank,
the largest morpho-syntactic and syntactic corpus
manually annotated for Hungarian. This treebank
is based on newspaper texts and is available in
both constituent-based (Csendes et al, 2005) and
dependency-based (Vincze et al, 2010) versions.
Around 10k sentences of news domain texts were
made available to the shared task.27 Each word is
manually assigned all its possible morpho-syntactic
25POS+morphology prediction accuracy is 91.95% overall
(59.54% for unseen tokens). POS only prediction accuracy is
93.20% overall (71.38% for unseen tokens).
26When vowel harmony applies, most suffixes exist in two
versions ? one with a front vowel and another one with a back
vowel ? and it is the vowels within the stem that determine which
form of the suffix is selected.
27The original treebank contains 82,000 sentences, 1.2 million
words and 250,000 punctuation marks from six domains.
160
tags and lemmas and the appropriate one is selected
according to the context. Sentences were manu-
ally assigned a constituency-based syntactic struc-
ture, which includes information on phrase structure,
grammatical functions (such as subject, object, etc.),
and subcategorization information (i.e., a given NP
is subcategorized by a verb or an infinitive). The
constituency trees were later automatically converted
into dependency structures, and all sentences were
then manually corrected. Note that there exist some
differences in the grammatical functions applied to
the constituency and dependency versions of the tree-
bank, since some morpho-syntactic information was
coded both as a morphological feature and as dec-
oration on top of the grammatical function in the
constituency trees.
Adapting the Data to the Shared Task Origi-
nally, the Szeged Dependency Treebank contained
virtual nodes for elided material (ELL) and phonolog-
ically covert copulas (VAN). In the current version,
they have been deleted, their daughters have been
attached to the parent of the virtual node, and have
been given complex labels, e.g. COORD-VAN-SUBJ,
where VAN is the type of the virtual node deleted,
COORD is the label of the virtual node and SUBJ is
the label of the daughter itself. When the virtual node
was originally the root of the sentence, its daughter
with a predicative (PRED) label has been selected as
the new root of the sentence (with the label ROOT-
VAN-PRED) and all the other daughters of the deleted
virtual node have been attached to it.
Predicted Morphology In order to provide the
same POS tag set for the constituent and dependency
treebanks, we used the dependency POS tagset for
both treebank instances. Both versions of the tree-
bank are available with gold standard and automatic
morphological annotation. The automatic POS tag-
ging was carried out by a 10-fold cross-validation
on the shared task data set by magyarlanc, a natu-
ral language toolkit for processing Hungarian texts
(segmentation, morphological analysis, POS tagging,
and dependency parsing). The annotation provides
POS tags and deep morphological features for each
input token (Zsibrita et al, 2013).28
28The full data sets of both the constituency and de-
pendency versions of the Szeged Treebank are available at
4.8 The Korean Treebank
The Treebank The Korean corpus is generated by
collecting constituent trees from the KAIST Tree-
bank (Choi et al, 1994), then converting the con-
stituent trees to dependency trees using head-finding
rules and heuristics. The KAIST Treebank consists
of about 31K manually annotated constituent trees
from 97 different sources (e.g., newspapers, novels,
textbooks). After filtering out trees containing an-
notation errors, a total of 27,363 trees with 350,090
tokens are collected.
The constituent trees in the KAIST Treebank29 also
come with manually inspected morphological analy-
sis based on ?eojeol?. An eojeol contains root-forms
of word tokens agglutinated with grammatical affixes
(e.g., case particles, ending markers). An eojeol can
consist of more than one word token; for instance, a
compound noun ?bus stop? is often represented as
one eojeol in Korean, ????????????, which can be
broken into two word tokens,???? (bus) and????????
(stop). Each eojeol in the KAIST Treebank is sepa-
rated by white spaces regardless of punctuation. Fol-
lowing the Penn Korean Treebank guidelines (Han
et al, 2002), punctuation is separated as individual
tokens, and parenthetical notations surrounded by
round brackets are grouped into individual phrases
with a function tag (PRN in our corpus).
All dependency trees are automatically converted
from the constituent trees. Unlike English, which
requires complicated head-finding rules to find the
head of each phrase (Choi and Palmer, 2012), Ko-
rean is a head final language such that the rightmost
constituent in each phrase becomes the head of that
phrase. Moreover, the rightmost conjunct becomes
the head of all other conjuncts and conjunctions in
a coordination phrase, which aligns well with our
head-final strategy.
The constituent trees in the KAIST Treebank do
not consist of function tags indicating syntactic or
semantic roles, which makes it difficult to generate
dependency labels. However, it is possible to gener-
ate meaningful labels by using the rich morphology
in Korean. For instance, case particles give good

161
indications of what syntactic roles eojeols with such
particles should take. Given this information, 21
dependency labels were generated according to the
annotation scheme proposed by Choi (2013).
Adapting the Data to the Shared Task All details
concerning the adaptation of the KAIST treebank
to the shared task specifications are found in Choi
(2013). Importantly, the rich KAIST treebank tag set
of 1975 POS tag types has been converted to a list of
CoNLL-like feature-attribute values refining coarse
grained POS categories.
Predicted Morphology Two sets of automatic
morphological analyses are provided for this task.
One is generated by the HanNanum morphological
analyzer.30 The HanNanum morphological ana-
lyzer gives the same morphemes and POS tags as the
KAIST Treebank. The other is generated by the Se-
jong morphological analyzer.31 The Sejong morpho-
logical analyzer gives a different set of morphemes
and POS tags as described in Choi and Palmer (2011).
4.9 The Polish Treebank
The Data Set Sk?adnica is a constituency treebank
of Polish (Wolin?ski et al, 2011; S?widzin?ski and
Wolin?ski, 2010). The trees were generated with
a non-probabilistic DCG parser S?wigra and then
disambiguated and validated manually. The ana-
lyzed texts come from the one-million-token sub-
corpus of the National Corpus of Polish (NKJP,
(Przepi?rkowski et al, 2012)) manually annotated
with morpho-syntactic tags.
The dependency version of Sk?adnica is a re-
sult of an automatic conversion of manually disam-
biguated constituent trees into dependency structures
(Wr?blewska, 2012). The conversion was an entirely
automatic process. Conversion rules were based
on morpho-syntactic information, phrasal categories,
and types of phrase-structure rules encoded within
constituent trees. It was possible to extract dependen-
cies because the constituent trees contain information
about the head of the majority of constituents. For
other constituents, heuristics were defined in order to
select their heads.
30http://kldp.net/projects/hannanum
31http://www.sejong.or.kr
The version of Sk?adnica used in the shared task
comprises parse trees for 8,227 sentences.32
Predicted Morphology For the shared task Pre-
dicted scenario, an automatic morphological an-
notation was generated by the PANTERA tagger
(Acedan?ski, 2010).
4.10 The Swedish Treebank
Swedish is moderately rich in inflections, including
a case system. Word order obeys the verb second
constraint in main clauses but is SVO in subordinate
clauses. Main clause order is freer than in English
but not as free as in some other Germanic languages,
such as German. Also, subject agreement with re-
spect to person and number has been dropped in
modern Swedish.
The Data Set The Swedish data sets are taken
from the Talbanken section of the Swedish Treebank
(Nivre and Megyesi, 2007). Talbanken is a syntacti-
cally annotated corpus developed in the 1970s, orig-
inally annotated according to the MAMBA scheme
(Teleman, 1974) with a syntactic layer consisting
of flat phrase structure and grammatical functions.
The syntactic annotation was later automatically con-
verted to full phrase structure with grammatical func-
tions and from that to dependency structure, as de-
scribed by Nivre et al (2006).
Both the phrase structure and the dependency
version use the functional labels from the original
MAMBA scheme, which provides a fine-grained clas-
sification of syntactic functions with 65 different la-
bels, while the phrase structure annotation (which
had to be inferred automatically) uses a coarse set
of only 8 labels. For the release of the Swedish tree-
bank, the POS level was re-annotated to conform to
the current de facto standard for Swedish, which is
the Stockholm-Ume? tagset (Ejerhed et al, 1992)
with 25 base tags and 25 morpho-syntactic features,
which together produce over 150 complex tags.
For the shared task, we used version 1.2 of the
treebank, where a number of conversion errors in
the dependency version have been corrected. The
phrase structure version was enriched by propagating
morpho-syntactic features from preterminals (POS

tags) to higher non-terminal nodes using a standard
head percolation table, and a version without crossing
branches was derived using the lifting strategy (Boyd,
2007).
Adapting the Data to the Shared Task Explicit
attribute names were added to the feature field and the
split was changed to match the shared task minimal
training set size.
Predicted Morphology POS tags and morpho-
syntactic features were produced using the Hun-
PoS tagger (Hal?csy et al, 2007) trained on the
Stockholm-Ume? Corpus (Ejerhed and K?llgren,
1997).
5 Overview of the Participating Systems
With 7 teams participating, more than 14 systems for
French and 10 for Arabic and German, this shared
task is on par with the latest large-scale parsing evalu-
ation campaign SANCL 2012 (Petrov and McDonald,
2012). The present shared task was extremely de-
manding on our participants. From 30 individuals or
teams who registered and obtained the data sets, we
present results for the seven teams that accomplished
successful executions on these data in the relevant
scenarios in the given the time frame.
5.1 Dependency Track
Seven teams participated in the dependency track.
Two participating systems are based on MaltParser:
MALTOPTIMIZER (Ballesteros, 2013) and AI:KU
(Cirik and S?ensoy, 2013). MALTOPTIMIZER uses
a variant of MaltOptimizer (Ballesteros and Nivre,
2012) to explore features relevant for the processing
of morphological information. AI:KU uses a combi-
nation of MaltParser and the original MaltOptimizer.
Their system development has focused on the inte-
gration of an unsupervised word clustering method
using contextual and morphological properties of the
words, to help combat sparseness.
Similarly to MaltParser ALPAGE:DYALOG
(De La Clergerie, 2013) also uses a shift-reduce
transition-based parser but its training and decoding
algorithms are based on beam search. This parser is
implemented on top of the tabular logic programming
system DyALog. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first dependency parser capable of handling
word lattice input.
Three participating teams use the MATE parser
(Bohnet, 2010) in their systems: the BASQUETEAM
(Goenaga et al, 2013), IGM:ALPAGE (Constant et
al., 2013) and IMS:SZEGED:CIS (Bj?rkelund et al,
2013). The BASQUETEAM uses the MATE parser in
combination with MaltParser (Nivre et al, 2007b).
The system combines the parser outputs via Malt-
Blender (Hall et al, 2007). IGM:ALPAGE also uses
MATE and MaltParser, once in a pipeline architec-
ture and once in a joint model. The models are com-
bined via a re-parsing strategy based on (Sagae and
Lavie, 2006). This system mainly focuses on MWEs
in French and uses a CRF tagger in combination
with several large-scale dictionaries to handle MWEs,
which then serve as input for the two parsers.
The IMS:SZEGED:CIS team participated in both
tracks, with an ensemble system. For the depen-
dency track, the ensemble includes the MATE parser
(Bohnet, 2010), a best-first variant of the easy-first
parser by Goldberg and Elhadad (2010b), and turbo
parser (Martins et al, 2010), in combination with
a ranker that has the particularity of using features
from the constituent parsed trees. CADIM (Marton et
al., 2013b) uses their variant of the easy-first parser
combined with a feature-rich ensemble of lexical and
syntactic resources.
Four of the participating teams use exter-
nal resources in addition to the parser. The
IMS:SZEGED:CIS team uses external morpholog-
ical analyzers. CADIM uses SAMA (Graff et al,
2009) for Arabic morphology. ALPAGE:DYALOG
and IGM:ALPAGE use external lexicons for French.
IGM:ALPAGE additionally uses Morfette (Chrupa?a
et al, 2008) for morphological analysis and POS
tagging. Finally, as already mentioned, AI:KU clus-
ters words and POS tags in an unsupervised fashion
exploiting additional, un-annotated data.
5.2 Constituency Track
A single team participated in the constituency parsing
task, the IMS:SZEGED:CIS team (Bj?rkelund et al,
2013). Their phrase-structure parsing system uses a
combination of 8 PCFG-LA parsers, trained using a
product-of-grammars procedure (Petrov, 2010). The
50-best parses of this combination are then reranked
by a model based on the reranker by Charniak and
163
Johnson (2005).33
5.3 Baselines
We additionally provide the results of two baseline
systems for the nine languages, one for constituency
parsing and one for dependency parsing.
For the dependency track, our baseline system is
MaltParser in its default configuration (the arc-eager
algorithm and liblinear for training). Results marked
as BASE:MALT in the next two sections report the
results of this baseline system in different scenarios.
The constituency parsing baseline is based on the
most recent version of the PCFG-LA model of Petrov
et al (2006), used with its default settings and five
split/merge cycles, for all languages.34 We use this
parser in two configurations: a ?1-best? configura-
tion where all POS tags are provided to the parser
(predicted or gold, depending on the scenario), and
another configuration in which the parser performs
its own POS tagging. These baselines are referred to
as BASE:BKY+POS and BASE:BKY+RAW respec-
tively in the following results sections. Note that
even when BASE:BKY+POS is given gold POS tags,
the Berkeley parser sometimes fails to reach a perfect
POS accuracy. In cases when the parser cannot find a
parse with the provided POS, it falls back on its own
POS tagging for all tokens.
6 Results
The high number of submitted system variants and
evaluation scenarios in the task resulted in a large
number of evaluation scores. In the following evalu-
ation, we focus on the best run for each participant,
and we aim to provide key points on the different
dimensions of analysis resulting from our evaluation
protocol. We invite our interested readers to browse
the comprehensive representation of our results on
the official shared-task results webpages.35
33Note that a slight but necessary change in the configuration
of one of our metrics, which occurred after the system submis-
sion deadline, resulted in the IMS:SZEGED:CIS team to submit
suboptimal systems for 4 languages. Their final scores are ac-
tually slightly higher and can be found in (Bj?rkelund et al,
2013).
34For Semitic languages, we used the lattice based PCFG-LA
extension by Goldberg (2011).

spmrl2013-sharedtask-results.html.
6.1 Gold Scenarios
This section presents the parsing results in gold sce-
narios, where the systems are evaluated on gold seg-
mented and tagged input. This means that the se-
quence of terminals, POS tags, and morphological
features are provided based on the treebank anno-
tations. This scenario was used in most previous
shared tasks on data-driven parsing (Buchholz and
Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al, 2007a; K?bler, 2008). Note
that this scenario was not mandatory. We thank our
participants for providing their results nonetheless.
We start by reviewing dependency-based parsing
results, both on the trees and on multi-word expres-
sion, and continue with the different metrics for
constituency-based parsing.
6.1.1 Dependency Parsing
Full Training Set The results for the gold parsing
scenario of dependency parsing are shown in the top
block of table 3.
Among the six systems, IMS:SZEGED:CIS
reaches the highest LAS scores, not only on aver-
age, but for every single language. This shows that
their approach of combining parsers with (re)ranking
provides robust parsing results across languages with
different morphological characteristics. The second
best system is ALPAGE:DYALOG, the third best sys-
tem is MALTOPTIMIZER. The fact that AI:KU is
ranked below the Malt baseline is due to their sub-
mission of results for 6 out of the 9 languages. Simi-
larly, CADIM only submitted results for Arabic and
ranked in the third place for this language, after the
two IMS:SZEGED:CIS runs. IGM:ALPAGE and
BASQUETEAM did not submit results for this setting.
Comparing LAS results across languages is prob-
lematic due to the differences between languages,
treebank size and annotation schemes (see section 3),
so the following discussion is necessarily tentative. If
we consider results across languages, we see that the
lowest results (around 83% for the best performing
system) are reached for Hebrew and Swedish, the
languages with the smallest data sets. The next low-
est result, around 86%, is reached for Basque. Other
languages reach similar LAS scores, around 88-92%.
German, with the largest training set, reaches the
highest LAS, 91.83%.
Interstingly, all systems have high LAS scores
on the Korean Treebank given a training set size

of approximately 23,000 sentences, which is a little
over half of the German treebank. For German, on
the other hand, only the IMS:SZEGED:CIS system
reaches higher LAS scores than for Korean. This
final observation indicates that more than treebank
size is important for comparing system performance
across treebanks. This is the reason for introducing
the reduced set scenario, in which we can see how the
participating system perform on a common ground,
albeit small.
5k Training Set The results for the gold setting
on the 5k train set are shown in the second block
of Table 3. Compared with the full training, we
see that there is a drop of around 2 points in this
setting. Some parser/language pairs are more sensi-
tive to data sparseness than others. CADIM, for in-
stance, exhibit a larger drop than MALTOPTIMIZER
on Arabic, and MALTOPTIMIZER shows a smaller
drop than IMS:SZEGED:CIS on French. On average,
among all systems that covered all languages, MALT-
OPTIMIZER has the smallest drop when moving to
5k training, possibly since the automatic feature opti-
mization may differ for different data set sizes.
Since all languages have the same number of sen-
tences in the train set, these results can give us limited
insight into the parsing complexity of the different
treebanks. Here, French, Arabic, Polish, and Korean
reach the highest LAS scores while Swedish reaches

Table 4: Dependency Parsing: MWE results
the lowest one. Treebank variance depends not only
on the language but also on annotation decisions,
such as label set (Swedish, interestingly, has a rela-
tively rich one). A more careful comparison would
then take into account the correlation of data size,
label set size and parsing accuracy. We investigate
these correlations further in section 7.1.
6.1.2 Multiword Expressions
MWE results on the gold setting are found at
the top of Table 4. All systems, with the excep-
tion of BASE:MALT, perform exceedingly well in
identifying the spans and non-head components of
MWEs given gold morphology.36 These almost per-
fect scores are the consequence of the presence of
two gold MWE features, namely MWEHEAD and
PRED=Y, which respectively indicate the node span
of the whole MWE and its dependents, which do not
have a gold feature field. The interesting scenario is,
of course, the predicted one, where these features are
not provided to the parser, as in any realistic applica-
tion.
36Note that for the labeled measure F_MWE+POS, both
MALTOPTIMIZER and ALPAGE:DYALOG have an F-score of
zero, since they do not attempt to predict the MWE label at all.
6.1.3 Constituency Parsing
In this part, we provide accuracy results for phrase-
structure trees in terms of ParsEval F-scores. Since
ParsEval is sensitive to the non-terminals-per-word
ratio in the data set (Rehbein and van Genabith,
2007a; Rehbein and van Genabith, 2007b), and given
the fact that this ratio varies greatly within our data
set (as shown in Table 2), it must be kept in mind that
ParsEval should only be used for comparing parsing
performance over treebank instances sharing the ex-
act same properties in term of annotation schemes,
sentence length and so on. When comparing F-Scores
across different treebanks and languages, it can only
provide a rough estimate of the relative difficulty or
ease of parsing these kinds of data.
Full Training Set The F-score results for the gold
scenario are provided in the first block of Table 5.
Among the two baselines, BASE:BKY+POS fares
better than BASE:BKY+RAW since the latter selects
its own POS tags and thus cannot benefit from the
gold information. The IMS:SZEGED:CIS system
clearly outperforms both baselines, with Hebrew as
an outlier.37
As in the dependency case, the results are not
strictly comparable across languages, yet we can
draw some insights from them. We see consider-
able differences between the languages, with Basque,
Hebrew, and Hungarian reaching F-scores in the low
90s for the IMS:SZEGED:CIS system, Korean and
Polish reaching above-average F-scores, and Ara-
bic, French, German, and Swedish reaching F-scores
below the average, but still in the low 80s. The per-
formance is, again, not correlated with data set sizes.
Parsing Hebrew, with one of the smallest training
sets, obtains higher accuracy many other languages,
including Swedish, which has the same training set
size as Hebrew. It may well be that gold morphologi-
cal information is more useful for combatting sparse-
ness in languages with richer morphology (though
Arabic here would be an outlier for this conjecture),
or it may be that certain treebanks and schemes are
inherently harder to parser than others, as we investi-
gate in section 7.
For German, the language with the largest training
37It might be that the easy layer of syntactic tags benefits from
the gold POS tags provided. See section 4 for further discussion
of this layer.

set and the highest scores in dependency parsing,
the F-scores are at the lower end. These low scores,
which are obtained despite the larger treebank and
only moderately free word-order, are surprising. This
may be due to case syncretism; gold morphological
information exhibits its own ambiguity and thus may
not be fully utilized.
5k Training Set Parsing results on smaller com-
parable test sets are presented in the second block
of Table 5. On average, IMS:SZEGED:CIS is less
sensitive than BASE:BKY+POS to the reduced size.
Systems are not equally sensitive to reduced training
sets, and the gaps range from 0.4% to 3%, with Ger-
man and Korean as outliers (Korean suffering a 6.4%
drop in F-score and German 7.3%). These languages
have the largest treebanks in the full setting, so it is
not surprising that they suffer the most. But this in
itself does not fully explain the cross-treebank trends.
Since ParsEval scores are known to be sensitive to
the label set sizes and the depth of trees, we provide
LeafAncestor scores in the following section.
6.1.4 Leaf-Ancestor Results
The variation across results in the previous subsec-
tion may have been due to differences across annota-
tion schemes. One way to neutralize this difference
(to some extent) is to use a different metric. We
evaluated the constituency parsing results using the
Leaf-Ancestor (LA) metric, which is less sensitive
to the number of nodes in a tree (Rehbein and van
Genabith, 2007b; K?bler et al, 2008). As shown in
Table 6, these results are on a different (higher) scale
than ParsEval, and the average gap between the full
and 5k setting is lower.
Full Training Set The LA results in gold setting
for full training sets are shown in the first block of Ta-
ble 6. The trends are similar to the ParsEval F-scores.
German and Arabic present the lowest LA scores
(in contrast to the corresponding F-scores, Arabic is
a full point below German for IMS:SZEGED:CIS).
Basque and Hungarian have the highest LA scores.
Hebrew, which had a higher F-score than Basque,
has a lower LA than Basque and is closer to French.
Korean also ranks worse in the LA analysis. The
choice of evaluation metrics thus clearly impacts sys-
tem rankings ? F-scores rank some languages suspi-
ciously high (e.g., Hebrew) due to deeper trees, and
another metric may alleviate that.
5k Training Set The results for the leaf-ancestor
(LA) scores in the gold setting for the 5k training set
are shown in the second block of Table 6. Across

parsers, IMS:SZEGED:CIS again has a smaller drop
than BASE:BKY+POS on the reduced size. German
suffers the most from the reduction of the training
set, with a loss of approximately 4 points. Korean,
however, which was also severely affected in terms
of F-scores, only loses 1.17 points in the LA score.
On average, the LA seem to reflect a smaller drop
when reducing the training set ? this underscores
again the impact of the choice of metrics on system
evaluation.
6.2 Predicted Scenarios
Gold scenarios are relatively easy since syntactically
relevant morphological information is disambiguated
in advance and is provided as input. Predicted scenar-
ios are more difficult: POS tags and morphological
features have to be automatically predicted, by the
parser or by external resources.
6.2.1 Dependency Parsing
Eight participating teams submitted dependency
results for this scenario. Two teams submitted for a
single language. Four teams covered all languages.
Full Training Set The results for the predicted
scenario in full settings are shown in the third
block of Table 3. Across the board, the re-
sults are considerably lower than the gold sce-
nario. Again, IMS:SZEGED:CIS is the best per-
forming system, followed by ALPAGE:DYALOG and
MALTOPTIMIZER. The only language for which
IMS:SZEGED:CIS is outperformed is French, for
which IGM:ALPAGE reaches higher results (85.86%
vs. 85.24%). This is due to the specialized treatment
of French MWEs in the IGM:ALPAGE system, which
is thereby shown to be beneficial for parsing in the
predicted setting.
If we compare the results for the predicted set-
ting and the gold one, given the full training set,
the IMS:SZEGED:CIS system shows small differ-
ences between 1.5 and 2 percent. The only ex-
ception is French, for which the LAS drops from
90.29% to 85.24% in the predicted setting. The
other systems show somewhat larger differences than
IMS:SZEGED:CIS, with the highest drops for Ara-
bic and Korean. The AI:KU system shows a similar
problem as IMS:SZEGED:CIS for French.
5k Training Set When we consider the predicted
setting for the 5k training set, in the last block of
Table 3, we see the same trends as comparing with
the full training set or when comparing to the gold
setting. Systems suffer from not having gold stan-
dard data, and they suffer from the small training set.
Interestingly, the loss between the different training
set sizes in the predicted setting is larger than in the
168
gold setting, but only marginally so, with a differ-
ence < 0.5. In other words, the predicted setting
adds a challenge to parsing, but it only minimally
compounds data sparsity.
6.2.2 Multiword Expressions Evaluation
In the predicted setting, shown in the second
block of table 4 for the full training set and in the
third block of the same table for the 5k training set,
we see that only two systems, IGM:ALPAGE and
IMS:SZEGED:CIS can predict the MWE label when
it is not present in the training set. IGM:ALPAGE?s
approach of using a separate classifier in combination
with external dictionaries is very successful, reach-
ing an F_MWE+POS score of 77.37. This is com-
pared to the score of 70.48 by IMS:SZEGED:CIS,
which predicts this node label as a side effect of
their constituent feature enriched dependency model
(Bj?rkelund et al, 2013). AI:KU has a zero score
for all predicted settings, which results from an erro-
neous training on the gold data rather than the pre-
dicted data.38
6.2.3 Constituency Parsing
Full Training Set The results for the predicted set-
ting with the full training set are shown in the third
block of table 5. A comparison with the gold setting
shows that all systems have a lower performance in
the predicted scenario, and the differences are in the
range of 0.88 for Arabic and 2.54 for Basque. It is
interesting to see that the losses are generally smaller
than in the dependency framework: on average, the
loss across languages is 2.74 for dependencies and
1.48 for constituents. A possible explanation can be
found in the two-dimensional structure of the con-
stituent trees, where only a subset of all nodes is
affected by the quality of morphology and POS tags.
The exception to this trend is Basque, for which the
loss in constituents is a full point higher than for de-
pendencies. Another possible explanation is that all
of our constituent parsers select their own POS tags
in one way or another. Most dependency parsers ac-
cept predicted tags from an external resource, which
puts an upper-bound on their potential performance.
5k Training Set The results for the predicted set-
ting given the 5k training set are shown in the bottom
38Unofficial updated results are to to be found in (Cirik and
S?ensoy, 2013)
block of table 5. They show the same trends as the
dependency ones: The results are slightly lower than
the results obtained in gold setting and the ones uti-
lizing the full training set.
6.2.4 Leaf Ancestor Metrics
Full Training Set The results for the predicted sce-
nario with a full training set are shown in the third
block of table 6. In the LA evaluation, the loss
in moving from gold morphology are considerably
smaller than in F-scores. For most languages, the
loss is less than 0.5 points. Exceptions are French
with a loss of 0.72, Hebrew with 0.89, and Korean
with 1.17. Basque, which had the highest loss in
F-scores, only shows a minor loss of 0.4 points. Also,
the average loss of 0.41 points is much smaller than
the one in the ParsEval score, 1.48.
5k Training Set The results for the predicted set-
ting given the 5k training set are shown in the last
block of table 6. These results, though considerably
lower (around 3 points), exhibit the exact same trends
as observed in the gold setting.
6.3 Realistic Raw Scenarios
The previous scenarios assume that input surface to-
kens are identical to tree terminals. For languages
such as Arabic and Hebrew, this is not always the
case. In this scenario, we evaluate the capacity of a
system to predict both morphological segmentation
and syntactic parse trees given raw, unsegmented
input tokens. This may be done via a pipeline as-
suming a 1-st best morphological analysis, or jointly
with parsing, assuming an ambiguous morpholog-
ical analysis lattice as input. In this task, both of
these scenarios are possible (see section 3). Thus,
this section presents a realistic evaluation of the par-
ticipating systems, using TedEval, which takes into
account complete morpho-syntactic parses.
Tables 7 and 8 present labeled and unlabeled
TedEval results for both constituency and depen-
dency parsers, calculated only for sentence of length
<= 70.39 We firstly observe that labeled TedEval
scores are considerably lower than unlabeled Ted-
Eval scores, as expected, since unlabeled scores eval-
uate only structural differences. In the labeled setup,
39TedEval builds on algorithms for calculating edit distance
on complete trees (Bille, 2005). In these algorithms, longer
sentences take considerably longer to evaluate.

the IMS:SZEGED:CIS dependency parser are the
best for both languages and data set sizes. Table 8
shows that their unlabeled constituency results reach
a higher accuracy than the next best system, their
own dependency results. However, a quick look at
the exact match metric reveals lower scores than for
its dependency counterparts.
For the dependency-based joint scenarios, there
is obviously an upper bound on parser performance
given inaccurate segmentation. The transition-based
systems, ALPAGE:DYALOG & MALTOPTIMIZER,
perform comparably on Arabic and Hebrew, with
ALPAGE:DYALOG being slightly better on both lan-
guages. Note that ALPAGE:DYALOG reaches close
results on the 1-best and the lattice-based input set-
tings, with a slight advantage for the former. This is
partly due to the insufficient coverage of the lexical
resource we use: many lattices do not contain the
gold path, so the joint prediction can only as be high
as the lattice predicted path allows.
7 Towards In-Depth Cross-Treebank
Evaluation
Section 6 reported evaluation scores across systems
for different scenarios. However, as noted, these re-
sults are not comparable across languages, represen-
tation types and parsing scenarios due to differences
in the data size, label set size, length of sentences and
also differences in evaluation metrics.
Our following discussion in the first part of this
section highlights the kind of impact that data set
properties have on the standard metrics (label set size
on LAS, non-terminal nodes per sentence on F-score).
Then, in the second part of this section we use the
TedEval cross-experiment protocols for comparative
evaluation that is less sensitive to representation types
and annotation idiosyncrasies.
7.1 Parsing Across Languages and Treebanks
To quantify the impact of treebank characteristics on
parsing parsing accuracy we looked at correlations
of treebank properties with parsing results. The most
highly correlated combinations we have found are
shown in Figures 2, 3, and 4 for the dependency track
and the constituency track (F-score and LeafAnces-

tor) respectively.
Figure 2 presents the LAS against the average num-
ber of tokens relative to the number of labels. The
numbers are averaged per language over all partici-
pating systems, and the size of the ?bubbles? is pro-
portional to the number of participants for a given
language setting. We provide ?bubbles? for all lan-
guages in the predicted (-P) and gold (-G) setting,
for both training set sizes. The lower dot in terms
of parsing scores always corresponds to the reduced
training set size.
Figure 2 shows a clear correlation between data-
set complexity and parsing accuracy. The simpler
the data set is (where ?simple" here translates into
large data size with a small set of labels), the higher
the results of the participating systems. The bubbles
reflects a diagonal that indicates correlation between
these dimensions. Beyond that, we see two interest-
ing points off of the diagonal. The Korean treebank
(pink) in the gold setting and full training set can be
parsed with a high LAS relative to its size and label
set. It is also clear that the Hebrew treebank (purple)
in the predicted version is the most difficult one to
parse, relative to our expectation about its complexity.
Since the Hebrew gold scenario is a lot closer to the
diagonal again, it may be that this outlier is due to the
coverage and quality of the predicted morphology.
Figure 340 shows the correlation of data complex-
ity in terms of the average number of non-terminals
per sentence, and parsing accuracy (ParsEval F-
score). Parsing accuracy is again averaged over all
participating systems for a given language. In this
figure, we see a diagonal similar to the one in figure 2,
where Arabic (dark blue) has high complexity of the
data (here interpreted as flat trees, low number of
non terminals per sentence) and low F-scores accord-
ingly. Korean (pink), Swedish (burgundy), Polish
(light green), and Hungarian (light blue) follow, and
then Hebrew (purple) is a positive outlier, possibly
due to an additional layer of ?easy" syntactic POS
nodes which increases tree size and inflates F-scores.
French (orange), Basque (red), and German (dark
green) are negative outliers, falling off the diago-
nal. German has the lowest F-score with respect to
40This figure was created from the IMS:SZEGED:CIS
(Const.) and our own PCFG-LA baseline in POS Tagged mode
(BASE:BKY+POS) so as to avoid the noise introduced by the
parser?s own tagging step (BASE:BKY+RAW).
what would be expected for the non-terminals per
sentence ratio, which is in contrast to the LAS fig-
ure where German occurs among the less complex
data set to parse. A possible explanation may be
the crossing branches in the original treebank which
were re-attached. This creates flat and variable edges
which might be hard predict accurately.
Figure 441 presents the correlation between parsing
accuracy in terms the LeafAncestor metrics (macro
averaged) and treebank complexity in terms of the
average number of non-terminals per sentence. As
in the correlation figures, the parsing accuracy is
averaged over the participanting systems for any lan-
guage. The LeafAncestor accuracy is calculated over
phrase structure trees, and we see a similar diago-
nal to the one in Figure 3 showing that flatter tree-
banks are harder (that is, are correlated with lower
averaged scores) But, its slope is less steep than for
the F-score, which confirms the observation that the
LeafAncestor metric is less sensitive than F-score to
the non-terminals-per-sentence ratio.
Similarly to Figure 3, German is a negative outlier,
which means that this treebank is harder to parse ? it
obtains lower scores on average than we would ex-
pect. As for Hebrew, it is much closer to the diagonal.
As it turns out, the "easy" POS layer that inflates the
scores does not affect the LA ratings as much.
7.2 Evaluation Across Scenarios, Languages
and Treebanks
In this section we analyze the results in cross-
scenario, cross-annotation, and cross-framework set-
tings using the evaluation protocols discussed in
(Tsarfaty et al, 2012b; Tsarfaty et al, 2011; Tsarfaty
et al, 2012a).
As a starting point, we select comparable sections
of the parsed data, based on system runs trained on
the small train set (train5k). For those, we selected
subsets containing the first 5,000 tree terminals (re-
specting sentence boundaries) of the test set. We only
used TedEval on sentences up to 70 terminals long,
and projectivized non-projective sentences in all sets.
We use the TedEval metrics to calculate scores on
both constituency and dependency structures in all
languages and all scenarios. Since the metric de-
fines one scale for all of these different cases, we can

F-score correlation in figure (Figure 3).

compare the performance across annotation schemes,
assuming that those subsets are representative of their
original source.42
Ideally, we would be using labeled TedEval scores,
as the labeled parsing task is more difficult, and la-
beled parses are far more informative than unlabeled
ones. However, most constituency-based parsers do
not provide function labels as part of the output, to
be compared with the dependency arcs. Furthermore,
as mentioned earlier, we observed a huge difference
between label set sizes for the dependency runs. Con-
sequently, labeled scores will not be as informative
across treebanks and representation types. We will
therefore only use labels across scenarios for the
same language and representation type.
42We choose this sample scheme for replicability. We first
tried sampling sentences, aiming at the same average sentence
length (20), but that seemed to create artificially difficult test sets
for languages as Polish and overly simplistic ones for French or
Arabic.
7.2.1 Cross-Scenario Evaluation: raw vs. gold
One novel aspect of this shared task is the evalu-
ation on non-gold segmentation in addition to gold
morphology. One drawback is that the scenarios are
currently not using the same metrics ? the metrics
generally applied for gold and predicted scenrios can-
not apply for raw. To assess how well state of the art
parsers perform in raw scenarios compared to gold
scenarios, we present here TedEval results comparing
raw and gold systems using the evaluation protocol
of Tsarfaty et al (2012b).
Table 9 presents the labeled and unlabeled results
for Arabic and Hebrew (in Full and 5k training set-
tings), and Table 10 presents unlabeled TedEval re-
sults (for all languages) in the gold settings. The
unlabeled TedEval results for the raw settings are
substantially lower then TedEval results on the gold
settings for both languages.
When comparing the unlabeled TedEval results for
Arabic and Hebrew on the participating systems, we
see a loss of 3-4 points between Table 9 (raw) and Ta-
ble 10 (gold). In particular we see that for the best per-
173
forming systems on Arabic (IMS:SZEGED:CIS for
both constituency and dependency), the gap between
gold and realistic scenarios is 3.4 and 4.3 points,
for the constituency and the dependency parser re-
spectively. These results are on a par with results
by Tsarfaty et al (2012b), who showed for different
settings, constituency and dependency based, that
raw scenarios are considerably more difficult to parse
than gold ones on the standard split of the Modern
Hebrew treebank.
For Hebrew, the performance gap between unla-
beled TedEval in raw (Table 9) and gold (Table 10)
is even more salient, with around 7 and 8 points of
difference between the scenarios. We can only specu-
late that such a difference may be due to the difficulty
of resolving Hebrew morpho-syntactic ambiguities
without sufficient syntactic information. Since He-
brew and Arabic now have standardized morpholog-
ically and syntactically analyzed data sets available
through this task, it will be possible to investigate
further how cross-linguistic differences in morpho-
logical ambiguity affect full-parsing accuracy in raw
scenarios.
This section compared the raw and gold parsing
results only on unlabeled TedEval metrics. Accord-
ing to what we have seen so far is expected that
for labeled TedEval metrics using the same protocol,
the gap between gold and raw scenario will be even
greater.
7.2.2 Cross-Framework Evaluation:
Dependency vs. Constituency
In this section, our focus is on comparing parsing
results across constituency and dependency parsers
based on the protocol of Tsarfaty et al (2012a) We
have only one submission from IMS:SZEGED:CIS
in the constituency track, and. from the same group,
a submission on the dependency track. We only com-
pare the IMS:SZEGED:CIS results on constituency
and dependency parsing with the two baselines we
provided. The results of the cross-framework evalua-
tion protocol are shown in Table 11.
The results comparing the two variants of the
IMS:SZEGED:CIS systems show that they are very
close for all languages, with differences ranging from
0.03 for German to 0.8 for Polish in the gold setting.
It has often been argued that dependency parsers
perform better than a constituency parser, but we
notice that when using a cross framework protocol,
such as TedEval, and assuming that our test set sam-
ple is representative, the difference between the in-
terpretation of both representation?s performance is
alleviated. Of course, here the metric is unlabeled, so
it simply tells us that both kind of parsing models are
equally able to provide similar tree structures. Said
differently, the gaps in the quality of predicting the
same underlying structure across representations for
MRLs is not as large as is sometimes assumed.
For most languages, the baseline constituency
parser performs better than the dependency base-
line one, with Basque and Korean as an exception,
and at the same time, the dependency version of
IMS:SZEGED:CIS performs slightly better than their
constituent parser for most languages, with the excep-
tion of Hebrew and Hungarian. It goes to show that,
as far as these present MRL results go, there is no
clear preference for a dependency over a constituency
parsing representation, just preferences among par-
ticular models.
More generally, we can say that even if the linguis-
tic coverage of one theory is shown to be better than
another one, it does not necessarily mean that the
statistical version of the formal theory will perform
better for structure prediction. System performance
is more tightly related to the efficacy of the learning
and search algorithms, and feature engineering on
top of the selected formalism.
7.2.3 Cross-Language Evaluation: All
Languages
We conclude with an overall outlook of the Ted-
Eval scores across all languages. The results on the
gold scenario, for the small training set and the 5k
test set are presented in Table 10. We concentrate
on gold scenarios (to avoid the variation in cover-
age of external morphological analyzers) and choose
unlabeled metrics as they are not sensitive to label
set sizes. We emphasize in bold, for each parsing
system (row in the table), the top two languages that
most accurately parsed by it (boldface) and the two
languages it performed the worse on (italics).
We see that the European languages German
and Hungarian are parsed most accurately in the
constituency-based setup, with Polish and Swedish
having an advantage in dependency parsing. Across
all systems, Korean is the hardest to parse, with Ara-

bic, Hebrew and to some extent French following. It
appears that on a typological scale, Semitic and Asian
languages are still harder to parse than a range of Eu-
ropean languages in terms of structural difficulty and
complex morpho-syntactic interaction. That said,
note that we cannot tell why certain treebanks appear
more challenging to parse then others, and it is still
unclear whether the difficulty is inherent on the lan-
guage, in the currently available models, or because
of the annotation scheme and treebank consistency.43
43The latter was shown to be an important factor orthogonal
to the morphologically-rich nature of the treebank?s language

8 Conclusion
This paper presents an overview of the first shared
task on parsing morphologically rich languages. The
task features nine languages, exhibiting different lin-
guistic phenomena and varied morphological com-
plexity. The shared task saw submissions from seven
teams, and results produced by more than 14 different
systems. The parsing results were obtained in dif-
ferent input scenarios (gold, predicted, and raw) and
evaluated using different protocols (cross-framework,
cross-scenario, and cross-language). In particular,
this is the first time an evaluation campaign reports
on the execution of parsers in realistic, morphologi-
cally ambiguous, setting.
The best performing systems were mostly ensem-
ble systems combining multiple parser outputs from
different frameworks or training runs, or integrat-
ing a state-of-the-art morphological analyzer on top
of a carefully designed feature set. This is con-
sistent with previous shared tasks such as ConLL
2007 or SANCL?2012. However, dealing with am-
biguous morphology is still difficult for all systems,
and a promising approach, as demonstrated by AL-
PAGE:DYALOG, is to deal with parsing and morphol-
ogy jointly by allowing lattice input to the parser. A
promising generalization of this approach would be
the full integration of all levels of analysis that are
mutually informative into a joint model.
The information to be gathered from the results of
this shared task is vast, and we only scratched the
surface with our preliminary analyses. We uncov-
ered and documented insights of strategies that make
parsing systems successful: parser combination is
empirically proven to reach a robust performance
across languages, though language-specific strategies
are still a sound avenue for obtaining high quality
parsers for that individual language. The integration
of morphological analysis into the parsing needs to
be investigated thoroughly, and new approaches that
are morphologically aware need to be developed.
Our cross-parser, cross-scenario, and cross-
framework evaluation protocols have shown that, as
expected, more data is better, and that performance
on gold morphological input is significantly higher
than that in more realistic scenarios. We have shown
that gold morphological information is more help-
(Schluter and van Genabith, 2007)
ful to some languages and parsers than others, and
that it may also interact with successful identification
of multiword expressions. We have shown that dif-
ferences between dependency and constituency are
smaller than previously assumed and that properties
of the learning model and granularity of the output
labels are more influential. Finally, we observed
that languages which are typologically farthest from
English, such as Semitic and Asian languages, are
still amongst the hardest to parse, regardless of the
parsing method used.
Our cross-treebank, in-depth analysis is still pre-
liminary, owing to the limited time between the end
of the shared task and the deadline for publication
of this overview. but we nonetheless feel that our
findings may benefit researchers who aim to develop
parsers for diverse treebanks.44
A shared task is an inspection of the state of the
art, but it may also accelerate research in an area
by providing a stable data basis as well as a set of
strong baselines. The results produced in this task
give a rich picture of the issues associated with pars-
ing MRLs and initial cues towards their resolution.
This set of results needs to be further analyzed to be
fully understood, which will in turn contribute to new
insights. We hope that this shared task will provide
inspiration for the design and evaluation of future
parsing systems for these languages.
