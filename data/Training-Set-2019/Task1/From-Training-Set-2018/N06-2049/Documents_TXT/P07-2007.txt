Abstract 
This paper describes the latest version of 
speech-to-speech translation systems de-
veloped by the team of NICT-ATR for over 
twenty years. The system is now ready to 
be deployed for the travel domain. A new 
noise-suppression technique notably im-
proves speech recognition performance. 
Corpus-based approaches of recognition, 
translation, and synthesis enable coverage 
of a wide variety of topics and portability 
to other languages.  
1 Introduction 
Speech recognition, speech synthesis, and machine 
translation research started about half a century 
ago. They have developed independently for a long 
time until speech-to-speech translation research 
was proposed in the 1980?s. The feasibility of 
speech-to-speech translation was the focus of re-
search at the beginning because each component 
was difficult to build and their integration seemed 
more difficult. After groundbreaking work for two 
decades, corpus-based speech and language proc-
essing technology have recently enabled the 
achievement of speech-to-speech translation that is 
usable in the real world.  
This paper introduces (at ACL 2007) the state-
of-the-art speech-to-speech translation system de-
veloped by NICT-ATR, Japan. 
2 SPEECH-TO-SPEECH TRANSLA-
TION SYSTEM 
A speech-to-speech translation system is very large 
and complex. In this paper, we prefer to describe 
recent progress. Detailed information can be found 
in [1, 2, 3] and their references. 
2.1 Speech recognition 
To obtain a compact, accurate model from corpora 
with a limited size, we use MDL-SSS [4] and 
composite multi-class N-gram models [5] for 
acoustic and language modeling, respectively. 
MDL-SSS is an algorithm that automatically de-
termines the appropriate number of parameters ac-
cording to the size of the training data based on the 
Maximum Description Length (MDL) criterion. 
Japanese, English, and Chinese acoustic models 
were trained using the data from 4,200, 532, and 
536 speakers, respectively. Furthermore, these 
models were adapted to several accents, e.g., US 
(the United States), AUS (Australia), and BRT 
(Britain) for English. A statistical language model 
was trained by using large-scale corpora (852 k 
sentences of Japanese, 710 k sentences of English, 
510 k sentences of Chinese) drawn from the travel 
domain. 
Robust speech recognition technology in noisy 
situations is an important issue for speech transla-
tion in real-world environments. An MMSE 
(Minimum mean square error) estimator for log 
Mel-spectral energy coefficients using a GMM 
(Gaussian Mixture Model) [6] is introduced for 
suppressing interference and noise and for attenu-
ating reverberation. 
Even when the acoustic and language models 
are trained well, environmental conditions such as 
variability of speakers, mismatches between the 
training and testing channels, and interference 
from environmental noise may cause recognition 
errors. These utterance recognition errors can be 
rejected by tagging them with a low confidence 
value. To do this we introduce generalized word 
25
posterior probability (GWPP)-based recognition 
error rejection for the post processing of the speech 
recognition [7, 8]. 
2.2 Machine translation 
The translation modules are automatically con-
structed from large-scale corpora: (1) TATR, a 
phrase-based SMT module and (2) EM, a simple 
memory-based translation module. EM matches a 
given source sentence against the source language 
parts of translation examples. If an exact match is 
achieved, the corresponding target language sen-
tence will be output. Otherwise, TATR is called up. 
In TATR, which is built within the framework of 
feature-based exponential models, we used the fol-
lowing five features: phrase translation probability 
from source to target; inverse phrase translation 
probability; lexical weighting probability from 
source to target; inverse lexical weighting prob-
ability; and phrase penalty. 
Here, we touch on two approaches of TATR: 
novel word segmentation for Chinese, and lan-
guage model adaptation.  
We used a subword-based approach for word 
segmentation of Chinese [9]. This word segmenta-
tion is composed of three steps. The first is a dic-
tionary-based step, similar to the word segmenta-
tion provided by LDC. The second is a subword-
based IOB tagging step implemented by a CRF  
tagging model. The subword-based IOB tagging 
achieves a better segmentation than character-
based IOB tagging. The third step is confidence-
dependent disambiguation to combine the previous 
two results. The subword-based segmentation was 
evaluated with two different data from the Sighan 
Bakeoff and the NIST machine translation evalua-
tion workshop. With the data of the second Sighan 
Bakeoff1, our segmentation gave a higher F-score 
than the best published results. We also evaluated 
this segmentation in a translation scenario using 
the data of NIST translation evaluation 2  2005, 
where its BLEU score3 was 1.1% higher than that 
using the LDC-provided word segmentation. 
The language model that is used plays an impor-
tant role in SMT. The effectiveness of the language

htm 
model is significant if the test data happen to have 
the same characteristics as those of the training 
data for the language models. However, this coin-
cidence is rare in practice. To avoid this perform-
ance reduction, a topic adaptation technique is of-
ten used. We applied this adaptation technique to 
machine translation. For this purpose, a ?topic? is 
defined as clusters of bilingual sentence pairs. In 
the decoding, for a source input sentence, f, a topic 
T is determined by maximizing P(f|T). To maxi-
mize P(f|T) we select cluster T that gives the high-
est probability for a given translation source sen-
tence f. After the topic is found, a topic-dependent 
language model P(e|T) is used instead of P(e), the 
topic-independent language model. The topic-
dependent language models were tested using 
IWSLT06 data 4 . Our approach improved the 
BLEU score between 1.1% and 1.4%. The paper of 
[10] presents a detailed description of this work.  
2.3 Speech synthesis 
An ATR speech synthesis engine called XIMERA 
was developed using large corpora (a 110-hour 
corpus of a Japanese male, a 60-hour corpus of a 
Japanese female, and a 20-hour corpus of a Chi-
nese female). This corpus-based approach makes it 
possible to preserve the naturalness and personality 
of the speech without introducing signal processing 
to the speech segment [11]. XIMERA?s HMM 
(Hidden Markov Model)-based statistical prosody 
model is automatically trained, so it can generate a 
highly natural F0 pattern [12]. In addition, the cost 
function for segment selection has been optimized 
based on perceptual experiments, thereby improv-
ing the naturalness of the selected segments [13]. 
3 EVALUATION 
3.1 Speech and language corpora 
We have collected three kinds of speech and lan-
guage corpora: BTEC (Basic Travel Expression 
Corpus), MAD (Machine Aided Dialog), and FED 
(Field Experiment Data) [14, 15, 16, and 17]. The 
BTEC Corpus includes parallel sentences in two 
languages composed of the kind of sentences one 
might find in a travel phrasebook. MAD is a dialog 
corpus collected using a speech-to-speech transla-
tion system. While the size of this corpus is rela-
tively limited, the corpus is used for adaptation and

evaluation. FED is a corpus collected in Kansai 
International Airport uttered by travelers using the 
airport. 
3.2 Speech recognition system 
The size of the vocabulary was about 35 k in ca-
nonical form and 50 k with pronunciation varia-
tions. Recognition results are shown in Table 1 for 
Japanese, English, and Chinese with a real-time 
factor5 of 5. Although the speech recognition per-
formance for dialog speech is worse than that for 
read speech, the utterance correctness excluding 
erroneous recognition output using GWPP [8] was 
greater than 83% in all cases.

The system works well in a noisy environment and 
translation can be performed for any combination 
of Japanese, English, and Chinese languages. The

5 CONCLUSION 
This paper presented a speech-to-speech transla-
tion system that has been developed by NICT-ATR 
for two decades. Various techniques, such as noise 
suppression and corpus-based modeling for both 
speech processing and machine translation achieve 
robustness and portability.  
The evaluation has demonstrated that our system 
is both effective and useful in a real-world envi-
ronment.
