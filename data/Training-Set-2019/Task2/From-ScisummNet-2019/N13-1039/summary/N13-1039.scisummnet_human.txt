Improved Part-of-Speech Tagging for Online Conversational Text with Word Clusters
We consider the problem of part-of-speech tagging for informal, online conversational text.
We systematically evaluate the use of large-scale unsupervised word clustering and new lexical features to improve tagging accuracy.
With these features, our system achieves state-of-the-art tagging results on both Twitter and IRC POS tagging tasks; Twitter tagging is improved from 90% to 93% accuracy (more than 3% absolute).
Qualitative analysis of these word clusters yields insights about NLP and linguistic phenomena in this genre.
Additionally, we contribute the first POS annotation guidelines for such text and release a new dataset of English language tweets annotated using these guidelines.
Tagging software, annotation guidelines, and large-scale word clusters are available at: http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP
This paper describes release 0.3 of the CMU Twitter Part-of-Speech Tagger and annotated data.
