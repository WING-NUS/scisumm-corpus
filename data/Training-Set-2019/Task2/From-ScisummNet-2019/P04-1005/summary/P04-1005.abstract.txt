This paper describes a noisy channel model of speech repairs, which can identify and correct repairs in speech transcripts.
A syntactic parser is used as the source model, and a novel type of TAG-based transducer is the channel model.
The use of TAG is motivated by the intuition that the reparandum is a "rough copy" of the repair.
The model is trained and tested on the Switchboard disfluency-annotated corpus.
