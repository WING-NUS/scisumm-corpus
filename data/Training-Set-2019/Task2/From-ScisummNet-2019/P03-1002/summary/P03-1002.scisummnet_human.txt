Using Predicate-Argument Structures For Information Extraction
In this paper we present a novel, customizable IE paradigm that takes advantage of predicate-argument structures.
We also introduce a new way of automatically identifying predicate argument structures, which is central to our IE paradigm.
It is based on: (1) an extended set of features; and (2) inductive decision tree learning.
The experimental results prove our claim that accurate predicate-argument structures enable high quality IE results.
We apply semantic parsing to capture the predicate-argument sentence structure.
