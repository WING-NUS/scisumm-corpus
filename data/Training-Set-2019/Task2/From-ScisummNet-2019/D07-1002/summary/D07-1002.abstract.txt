Shallow semantic parsing, the automatic identification and labeling of sentential constituents, has recently received much attention.
Our work examines whether semantic role information is beneficial to question answering.
We introduce a general framework for answer extraction which exploits semantic role annotations in the FrameNet paradigm.
We view semantic role assignment as an optimization problem in a bipartite graph and answer extraction as an instance of graph matching.
Experimental results on the TREC datasets demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art models.
