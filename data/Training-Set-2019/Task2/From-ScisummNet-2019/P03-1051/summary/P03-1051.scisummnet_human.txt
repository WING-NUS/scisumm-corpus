Language Model Based Arabic Word Segmentation
We approximate Arabic’s rich morphology by a model that a word consists of a sequence of morphemes in the pattern prefix*-stem-suffix* (* denotes zero or more occurrences of a morpheme).
Our method is seeded by a small manually segmented Arabic corpus and uses it to bootstrap an unsupervised algorithm to build the Arabic word segmenter from a large unsegmented Arabic corpus.
The algorithm uses a trigram language model to determine the most probable morpheme sequence for a given input.
The language model is initially estimated from a small manually segmented corpus of about 110,000 words.
To improve the segmentation accuracy, we use an unsupervised algorithm for automatically acquiring new stems from a 155 million word unsegmented corpus, and re-estimate the model parameters with the expanded vocabulary and training corpus.
The resulting Arabic word segmentation system achieves around 97% exact match accuracy on a test corpus containing 28,449 word tokens.
We believe this is a state-of-the-art performance and the algorithm can be used for many highly inflected languages provided that one can create a small manually segmented corpus of the language of interest.
We demonstrate a technique for segmenting Arabic text and use it as a morphological processing step in machine translation.
