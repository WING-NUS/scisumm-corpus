Thumbs Up Or Thumbs Down? Semantic Orientation Applied To Unsupervised Classification Of Reviews
This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down).
The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs.
A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., “subtle nuances”) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., “very cavalier”).
In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word “excellent” minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word “poor”.
A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive.
The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations).
The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews.
We describe a way to automatically build a lexicon based on looking at co-occurrences of words with other words whose sentiment is known.
