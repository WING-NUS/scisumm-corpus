We consider the task of unsupervised lecture segmentation.
We formalize segmentation as a graph-partitioning task that optimizes the normalized cut criterion.
Our approach moves beyond localized comparisons and takes into account long-range cohesion dependencies.
Our results demonstrate that global analysis improves the segmentation accuracy and is robust in the presence of speech recognition errors.
