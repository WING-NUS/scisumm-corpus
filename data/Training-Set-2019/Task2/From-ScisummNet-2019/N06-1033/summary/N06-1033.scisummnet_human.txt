Synchronous Binarization For Machine Translation
Systems based on synchronous grammars and tree transducers promise to improve the quality of statistical machine translation output, but are often very computationally intensive.
The complexity is exponential in the size of individual grammar rules due to arbitrary re-orderings between the two languages, and rules extracted from parallel corpora can be quite large.
We devise a linear-time algorithm for factoring syntactic re-orderings by binarizing synchronous rules when possible and show that the resulting rule set significantly improves the speed and accuracy of a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine translation system.
Synchronous binarization simultaneously binarizes both source and target-sides of a synchronous rule, making sure of contiguous spans on both sides whenever possible.
