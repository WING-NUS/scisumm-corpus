Global Thresholding And Multiple-Pass Parsing
We present a variation on classic beam thresholding techniques that is up to an order of magnitude faster than the traditional method, at the same performance level.
We also present a new thresholding technique, global thresholding, which, combined with the new beam thresholding, gives an additional factor of two improvement, and a novel technique, multiple pass parsing, that can be combined with the others to yield yet another 50% improvement.
We use a new search algorithm to simultaneously optimize the thresholding parameters of the various algorithms.
we describe a method for producing a simple but crude approximate grammar of a standard context-free grammar.
