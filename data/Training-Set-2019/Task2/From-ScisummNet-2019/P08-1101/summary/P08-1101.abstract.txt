For Chinese POS tagging, word segmentation is a preliminary step. To avoid error propagation and improve segmentation by utilizing POS information, segmentation and tagging can be performed simultaneously. 
A challenge for this joint approach is the large combined search space, which makes efficient decoding very hard. 
Recent research has explored the integration of segmentation and POS tagging, by decoding under restricted versions of the full combined search space. 
In this paper, we propose a joint segmentation and POS tagging model that does not impose any hard constraints on the interaction between word and POS information. 
Fast decoding is achieved by using a novel multiple-beam search algorithm. 
The system uses a discriminative statistical model, trained using the generalized perceptron algorithm. 
The joint model gives an error reduction in segmentation accuracy of 14.6% and an error reduction in tagging accuracy of 12.2%, compared to the traditional pipeline approach.
