Determining the polarity of a sentiment-bearing expression requires more than a simple bag-of-words approach.
In particular, words or constituents within the expression can interact with each other to yield a particular overall polarity.
In this paper, we view such subsentential interactions in light of compositional semantics, and present a novel learning-based approach that incorporates structural inference motivated by compositional semantics into the learning procedure.
Our experiments show that (1) simple heuristics based on compositional semantics can perform better than learning-based methods that do not incorporate compositional semantics (accuracy of 89.7% vs. 89.1%), but (2) a method that integrates compositional semantics into learning performs better than all other alternatives (90.7%).
We also find that “content-word negators”, not widely employed in previous work, play an important role in determining expression-level polarity.
Finally, in contrast to conventional wisdom, we find that expression-level classification accuracy uniformly decreases as additional, potentially disambiguating, context is considered.
