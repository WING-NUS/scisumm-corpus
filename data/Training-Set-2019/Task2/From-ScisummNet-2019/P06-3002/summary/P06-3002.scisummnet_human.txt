Unsupervised Part-Of-Speech Tagging Employing Efficient Graph Clustering
An unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) tagging system that relies on graph clustering methods is described.
Unlike in current state-of-the-art approaches, the kind and number of different tags is generated by the method itself.
We compute and merge two partitionings of word graphs: one based on context similarity of high frequency words, another on log-likelihood statistics for words of lower frequencies.
Using the resulting word clusters as a lexicon, a Viterbi POS tagger is trained, which is refined by a morphological component.
The approach is evaluated on three different languages by measuring agreement with existing taggers.
We directly compare the tagger output to supervised taggers for English, German and Finnish via information-theoretic measures.
We conceptualize a network of words that capture the word co-occurrence patterns.
We cluster the most frequent 10,000 words using contexts formed from the most frequent 150-200 words.
