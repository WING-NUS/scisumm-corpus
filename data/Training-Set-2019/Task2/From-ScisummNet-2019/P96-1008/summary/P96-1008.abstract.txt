We present a natural language interface system which is based entirely on trained statistical models.
The system consists of three stages of processing: parsing, semantic interpretation, and discourse.
Each of these stages is modeled as a statistical process.
The models are fully integrated, resulting in an end-to-end system that maps input utterances into meaning representation frames.
