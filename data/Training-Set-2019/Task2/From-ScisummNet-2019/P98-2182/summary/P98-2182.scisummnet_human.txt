Noun-Phrase Co-occurrence Statistics for Semi-Automatic Semantic Lexicon Construction
Generating semantic lexicons semi-automatically could be a great time saver, relative to creating them by hand.
In this paper, we present an algorithm for extracting potential entries for a category from an online corpus, based upon a small set of exemplars.
Our algorithm finds more correct terms and fewer incorrect ones than previous work in this area.
Additionally, the entries that are generated potentially provide broader coverage of the category than would occur to an individual coding them by hand.
Our algorithm finds many terms not included within Wordnet (many more than previous algorithms), and could be viewed as an "enhancer" of existing broad-coverage resources.
We use co-occurrence statistics in local context to discover sibling relations.
Our experiments were performed using the MUC-4 and Wall Street Journal corpuses (about 30 million words).
To select seed words we rank all of the head nouns in the training corpus by frequency and manually select the first 10 nouns that unambiguously belong to each category.
We find that 3 of every 5 words learned by our system are not present in WordNet.
