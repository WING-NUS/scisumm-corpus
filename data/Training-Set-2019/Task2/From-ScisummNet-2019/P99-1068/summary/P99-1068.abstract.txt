STRAND (Resnik, 1998) is a language-independent system for automatic discovery of text in parallel translation on the World Wide Web.
This paper extends the preliminary STRAND results by adding automatic language identification, scaling up by orders of magnitude, and formally evaluating performance.
The most recent end-product is an automatically acquired parallel corpus comprising 2491 English-French document pairs, approximately 1.5 million words per language.
