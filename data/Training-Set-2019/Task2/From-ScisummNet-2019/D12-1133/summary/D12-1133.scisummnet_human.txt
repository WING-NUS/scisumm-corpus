A Transition-Based System for Joint Part-of-Speech Tagging and Labeled Non-Projective Dependency Parsing
Most current dependency parsers presuppose that input words have been morphologically disambiguated using a part-of-speech tagger before parsing begins.
We present a transition-based system for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with non-projective trees.
Experimental evaluation on Chinese, Czech, English and German shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy when compared to a pipeline system, which lead to improved state-of-the-art results for all languages.
we introduce a transition-based system that jointly performed POS tagging and dependency parsing.
