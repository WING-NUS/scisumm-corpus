We present an unsupervised method for detecting grammatical errors by inferring negative evidence from edited textual corpora.
The system was developed and tested using essay-length responses to prompts on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).
The error-recognition system, ALEK, performs with about 80% precision and 20% recall.
