We evaluate the accuracy of an unlexicalized statistical parser, trained on 4K treebanked sentences from balanced data and tested on the PARC DepBank.
We demonstrate that a parser which is competitive in accuracy (without sacrificing processing speed) can be quickly tuned without reliance on large in-domain manually-constructed treebanks.
This makes it more practical to use statistical parsers in applications that need access to aspects of predicate-argument structure.
The comparison of systems using DepBank is not straightforward, so we extend and validate DepBank and highlight a number of representation and scoring issues for relational evaluation schemes.
