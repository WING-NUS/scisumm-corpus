This paper describes an experimental comparison of seven different learning algorithms on the problem of learning to disambiguate the meaning of a word from context.
The algorithms tested include statistical, neural-network, decision-tree, rule-based, and case-based classification techniques.
The specific problem tested involves disambiguating six senses of the word "line" using the words in the current and proceeding sentence as context.
The statistical and neural-network methods perform the best on this particular problem and we discuss a potential reason for this observed difference.
We also discuss the role of bias in machine learning and its importance in explaining performance differences observed on specific problems.
