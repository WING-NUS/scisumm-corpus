We are trying to extend the boundary of Information Extraction (IE) systems.
Existing IE systems require a lot of time and human effort to tune for a new scenario.
Preemptive Information Extraction is an attempt to automatically create all feasible IE systems in advance without human intervention.
We propose a technique called Unrestricted Relation Discovery that discovers all possible relations from texts and presents them as tables.
We present a preliminary system that obtains reasonably good results.
