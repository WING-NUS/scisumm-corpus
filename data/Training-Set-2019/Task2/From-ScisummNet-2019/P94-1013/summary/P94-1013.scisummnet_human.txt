Decision Lists For Lexical Ambiguity Resolution: Application To Accent Restoration In Spanish And French
This paper presents a statistical decision procedure for lexical ambiguity resolution.
The algorithm exploits both local syntactic patterns and more distant collocational evidence, generating an efficient, effective, and highly perspicuous recipe for resolving a given ambiguity.
By identifying and utilizing only the single best disambiguating evidence in a target context, the algorithm avoids the problematic complex modeling of statistical dependencies.
Although directly applicable to a wide class of ambiguities, the algorithm is described and evaluated in a realistic case study, the problem of restoring missing accents in Spanish and French text.
Current accuracy exceeds 99% on the full task, and typically is over 90% for even the most difficult ambiguities.
We note that lemmatization allows for more compact and generalizable data by clustering all inflected forms of an ambiguous word together.
The strategy we adopt to model syntagmatic relations is to provide bigrams and trigrams of collocated words as features to descrive local contexts.
