VerbOcean: Mining The Web For Fine-Grained Semantic Verb Relations
Broad-coverage repositories of semantic relations between verbs could benefit many NLP tasks.
We present a semi-automatic method for extracting fine-grained semantic relations between verbs.
We detect similarity, strength, antonymy, enablement, and temporal happens-before relations between pairs of strongly associated verbs using lexicosyntactic patterns over the Web.
On a set of 29,165 strongly associated verb pairs, our extraction algorithm yielded 65.5 % accuracy.
Analysis of error types shows that on the relation strength we achieved 75 % accuracy.
We provide the resource, called VERBOCEAN, for download at http://semantics.isi.edu/ocean/.
we introduce a 5-class set, designed specifically for characterizing verb-verb semantic relations.
we use patterns to extract a set of relations between verbs, such as similarity, strength and antonymy.
