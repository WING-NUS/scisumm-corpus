In this paper, it is argued that "coreference" annotations, as performed in the MUC community for example, go well beyond annotation of the relation of coreference proper.
As a result, it is not always clear what semantic relation these annotations are encoding.
The paper discusses a number of problems with these annotations and concludes that rethinking of the coreference task is needed before the task is expanded.
In particular, it suggests a division of labor whereby annotation of the coreference relation proper is separated from other tasks such as annotation of bound anaphora and of the relation between a subject and a predicative NP.
