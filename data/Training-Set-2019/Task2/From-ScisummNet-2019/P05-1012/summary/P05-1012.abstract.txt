We present an effective training algorithm for linearly-scored dependency parsers that implements online large-margin multi-class training (Crammer and Singer, 2003; Crammer et al., 2003) on top of efficient parsing techniques for dependency trees (Eisner, 1996).
The trained parsers achieve a competitive dependency accuracy for both English and Czech with no language specific enhancements.
