This paper considers the problem of automatic assessment of local coherence.
We present a novel entity-based representation of discourse which is inspired by Centering Theory and can be computed automatically from raw text.
We view coherence assessment as a ranking learning problem and show that the proposed discourse representation supports the effective learning of a ranking function.
Our experiments demonstrate that the induced model achieves significantly higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art coherence model.
