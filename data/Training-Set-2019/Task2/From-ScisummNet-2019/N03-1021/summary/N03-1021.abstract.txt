Multitext Grammars (MTGs) generate arbitrarily many parallel texts via production rules of arbitrary length.
Both ordinary MTGs and their bilexical subclass admit relatively efficient parsers.
Yet, MTGs are more expressive than other synchronous formalisms for which parsers have been described in the literature.
The combination of greater expressive power and relatively low cost of inference makes MTGs an attractive foundation for practical models of translational equivalence.
