Again, also the application making use of the read ability assessment, which is in turn strictly related to the intended audience of readers, strongly influences the typology of features to be taken into account. Advanced NLP? based readability metrics developed so far typically deal with English, with a few attempts devoted to other languages, namely French (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004), Portuguese (Aluisio et al, 2010) and German (Bru? ck, 2008)",
