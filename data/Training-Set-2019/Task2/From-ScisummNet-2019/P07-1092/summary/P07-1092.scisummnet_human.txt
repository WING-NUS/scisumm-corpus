Machine Translation by Triangulation: Making Effective Use of Multi-Parallel Corpora
Current phrase-based SMT systems perform poorly when using small training sets.
This is a consequence of unreliable translation estimates and low coverage over source and target phrases.
This paper presents a method which alleviates this problem by exploiting multiple translations of the same source phrase.
Central to our approach is triangulation, the process of translating from a source to a target language via an intermediate third language.
This allows the use of a much wider range of parallel corpora for training, and can be combined with a standard phrase-table using conventional smoothing methods.
Experimental results demonstrate BLEU improvements for triangulated models over a standard phrase-based system.
