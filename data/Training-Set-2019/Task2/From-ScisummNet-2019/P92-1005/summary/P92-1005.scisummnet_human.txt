Monotonic Semantic Interpretation
Aspects of semantic interpretation, such as quantifier scoping and reference resolution, are often realised computationally by non-monotonic operations involving loss of information and destructive manipulation of semantic representations.
The paper describes how monotonic reference resolution and scoping can be carried out using a revised Quasi Logical Form (QLF) representation.
Semantics for QLF are presented in which the denotations of formulas are extended monotonically as QLF expressions are resolved.
We make use of Quasi Logical Form, a monotonic representation for compositional semantics.
A quasi logical form allows the under-specification of several types of information, such as anaphoric references, ellipsis and semantic relations.
