Dynamic Programming for Linear-Time Incremental Parsing
Incremental parsing techniques such as shift-reduce have gained popularity thanks to their efficiency, but there remains a major problem: the search is greedy and only explores a tiny fraction of the whole space (even with beam search) as opposed to dynamic programming.
We show that, surprisingly, dynamic programming is in fact possible for many shift-reduce parsers, by merging “equivalent” stacks based on feature values.
Empirically, our algorithm yields up to a five-fold speedup over a state-of-the-art shift-reduce dependency parser with no loss in accuracy.
Better search also leads to better learning, and our final parser outperforms all previously reported dependency parsers for English and Chinese, yet is much faster.
In this paper, we follow the line of investigation started by Huang and Sagae (2010) and apply dynamic programming to (projective) transition-based dependency parsing (Nivre, 2008).
The essential idea in our calculation is to delegate (in the computation of the Viterbi score) the scoring of sh transitions to the inference rules for la/ra.
