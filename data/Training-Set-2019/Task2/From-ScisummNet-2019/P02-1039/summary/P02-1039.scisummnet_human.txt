A Decoder For Syntax-Based Statistical MT
This paper describes a decoding algorithm for a syntax-based translation model (Yamada and Knight, 2001).
The model has been extended to incorporate phrasal translations as presented here.
In contrast to a conventional word-to-word statistical model, a decoder for the syntax-based model builds up an English parse tree given a sentence in a foreign language.
As the model size becomes huge in a practical setting, and the decoder considers multiple syntactic structures for each word alignment, several pruning techniques are necessary.
We tested our decoder in a Chinese-to-English translation system, and obtained better results than IBM Model 4.
We also discuss issues concerning the relation between this decoder and a language model.
We propose a syntax-based decoder that restrict word reordering based on reordering operations on syntactic parse-trees of the input sentence.
