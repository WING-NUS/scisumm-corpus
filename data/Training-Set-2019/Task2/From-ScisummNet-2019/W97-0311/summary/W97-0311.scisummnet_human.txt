Automatic Discovery Of Non-Compositional Compounds In Parallel Data
Automatic segmentation of text into minimal content-bearing units is an unsolved problem even for languages like English.
Spaces between words offer an easy first approximation, but this approximation is not good enough for machine translation (MT), where many word sequences are not translated word-for-word.
This paper presents an efficient automatic method for discovering sequences of words that are translated as a unit.
The method proceeds by comparing pairs of statistical translation models induced from parallel texts in two languages.
It can discover hundreds of non-compositional compounds on each iteration, and constructs longer compounds out of shorter ones.
Objective evaluation on a simple machine translation task has shown the method's potential to improve the quality of MT output.
The method makes few assumptions about the data, so it can be applied to parallel data other than parallel texts, such as word spellings and pronunciations.
we propose a method for the recognition of multi word compounds in bi texts that is based on the predictive value of a translation model.
we investigates techniques for identifying non-compositional compounds in English-French parallel corpora and emphasises that translation models that take non compositional compounds into account are more accurate.
