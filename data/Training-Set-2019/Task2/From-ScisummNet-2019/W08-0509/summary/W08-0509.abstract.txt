Training word alignment models on large corpora is a very time-consuming processes.
This paper describes two parallel implementations of GIZA++ that accelerate this word alignment process.
One of the implementations runs on computer clusters, the other runs on multi-processor system using multi-threading technology.
Results show a near-linear speed-up according to the number of CPUs used, and alignment quality is preserved.
