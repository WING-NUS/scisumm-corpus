Functional Unification Grammar: A Formalism For Machine Translation
Functional Unification Grammar provides an opportunity to encompass within one formalism and computational system the parts of machine translation systems that have usually been treated separately, natably analysis, transfer, and synthesis.
Many of the advantages of this formalism come from the fact that it is monotonic allowing data structures to grow differently as different nondeterministic alternatives in a computation are pursued, but never to be modified in any way.
A striking feature of this system is that it is fundamental reversible, allowing a to translate as b only if b could translate as a.
