Most work on unsupervised entailment rule acquisition focused on rules between templates with two variables, ignoring unary rules - entailment rules between templates with a single variable. 
In this paper we investigate two approaches for unsupervised learning of such rules and compare the proposed methods with a binary rule learning method.
The results show that the learned unary rule-sets outperform the binary rule-set. 
In addition, a novel directional similarity measure for learning entailment, termed Balanced-Inclusion, is the best performing measure.
