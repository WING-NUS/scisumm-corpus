We describe a methodology for rapid experimentation in statistical machine translation which we use to add a large number of features to a baseline system exploiting features from a wide range of levels of syntactic representation.
Feature values were combined in a log-linear model to select the highest scoring candidate translation from an n-best list.
Feature weights were optimized directly against the BLEU evaluation metric on held-out data.
We present results for a small selection of features at each level of syntactic representation.
