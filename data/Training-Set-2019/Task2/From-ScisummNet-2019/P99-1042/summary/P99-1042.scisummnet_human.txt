Deep Read: A Reading Comprehension System
This paper describes initial work on Deep Read, an automated reading comprehension system that accepts arbitrary text input (a story) and answers questions about it.
We have acquired a corpus of 60 development and 60 test stories of 3rd to 6th grade material; each story is followed by short-answer questions (an answer key was also provided).
We used these to construct and evaluate a baseline system that uses pattern matching (bag-of-words) techniques augmented with additional automated linguistic processing (stemming, name identification, semantic class identification, and pronoun resolution).
This simple system retrieves the sentence containing the answer 30-40% of the time.
We use a statistical bag-of-words approach, matching the question with the lexically most similar sentence in the story.
