Human linguistic annotation is crucial for many natural language processing tasks but can be expensive and time-consuming.
We explore the use of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk system, a significantly cheaper and faster method for collecting annotations from a broad base of paid non-expert contributors over the Web.
We investigate five tasks: affect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, event temporal ordering, and word sense disambiguation.
For all five, we show high agreement between Mechanical Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels provided by expert labelers.
For the task of affect recognition, we also show that using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effective as using gold standard annotations from experts.
We propose a technique for bias correction that significantly improves annotation quality on two tasks.
We conclude that many large labeling tasks can be effectively designed and carried out in this method at a fraction of the usual expense.
