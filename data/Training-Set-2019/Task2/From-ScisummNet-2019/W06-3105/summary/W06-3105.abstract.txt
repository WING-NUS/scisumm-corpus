We investigate why weights from generative models underperform heuristic estimates in phrase-based machine translation.
We first propose a simple generative, phrase-based model and verify that its estimates are inferior to those given by surface statistics.
The performance gap stems primarily from the addition of a hidden segmentation variable, which increases the capacity for overfitting during maximum likelihood training with EM.
In particular, while word level models benefit greatly from re-estimation, phrase-level models do not: the crucial difference is that distinct word alignments cannot all be correct, while distinct segmentations can.
Alternate segmentations rather than alternate alignments compete, resulting in increased determinization of the phrase table, decreased generalization, and decreased final BLEU score.
We also show that interpolation of the two methods can result in a modest increase in BLEU score.
