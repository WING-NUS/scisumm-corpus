This paper presents and compares WordNet-based and distributional similarity approaches.
The strengths and weaknesses of each approach regarding similarity and relatedness tasks are discussed, and a combination is presented.
Each of our methods independently provide the best results in their class on the RG and WordSim353 datasets, and a supervised combination of them yields the best published results on all datasets.
Finally, we pioneer cross-lingual similarity, showing that our methods are easily adapted for a cross-lingual task with minor losses.
