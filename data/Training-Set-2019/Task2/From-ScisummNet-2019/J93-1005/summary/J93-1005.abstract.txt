We propose that many ambiguous prepositional phrase attachments can be resolved on the basis of the relative strength of association of the preposition with verbal and nominal heads, estimated on the basis of distribution in an automatically parsed corpus.
This suggests that a distributional approach can provide an approximate solution to parsing problems that, in the worst case, call for complex reasoning.
