Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) is a formalism for natural language grammars.
Some of the basic notions of TAG's were introduced in [Joshi, Levy, and Takakashi 1975] and by [Joshi, 1983].
A detailed investigation of the linguistic relevance of TAG's has been carried out in [Kroch and Joshi, 1985].
In this paper, we will describe some new results for TAG's, especially in the following areas: (1) parsing complexity of TAG's, (2) some closure results for TAG's, and (3) the relationship to Head grammars.
