    "raw_text": "Human-humandialogs, however, may not provide a very good model of sentence planning strategies for a computational system because the sentence planner must plan communicative goals such as implicit confirmation which are needed to prevent and correct errors in automatic speech recognition but which are rare in human-human dialog. Other related work deals with discourse-related aspects of sentence planning such as cue word placement (Moser and Moore, 1995), clearly a crucial task whose integration into our approach we leave to future work. Mellish et al (1998) investigate the problem of deter mining a discourse tree for a set of elementary speech acts which are partially constrained by rhetorical relations",
