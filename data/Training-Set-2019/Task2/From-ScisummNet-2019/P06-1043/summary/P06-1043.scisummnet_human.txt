Reranking And Self-Training For Parser Adaptation
Statistical parsers trained and tested on the Penn Wall Street Journal (WSJ) treebank have shown vast improvements over the last 10 years.
Much of this improvement, however, is based upon an ever-increasing number of features to be trained on (typically) the WSJ treebank data.
This has led to concern that such parsers may be too finely tuned to this corpus at the expense of portability to other genres.
Such worries have merit.
The standard "Charniak parser" checks in at a labeled precision-recall f-measure of 89.7% on the Penn WSJ test set, but only 82.9% on the test set from the Brown treebank corpus.
This paper should allay these fears.
In particular, we show that the reranking parser described in Charniak and Johnson (2005) improves performance of the parser on Brown to 85.2%.
Furthermore, use of the self-training techniques described in (McClosky et al., 2006) raise this to 87.8% (an error reduction of 28%) again without any use of labeled Brown data.
We successfully applied self-training to parsing by exploiting available unlabeled data, and obtained remarkable results when the same technique was applied to parser adaptation.
