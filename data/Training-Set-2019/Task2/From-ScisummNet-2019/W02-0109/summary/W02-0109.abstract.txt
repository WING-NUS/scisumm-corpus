NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit, is a suite of open source program modules, tutorials and problem sets, providing ready-to-use computational linguistics courseware.
NLTK covers symbolic and statistical natural language processing, and is interfaced to annotated corpora.
Students augment and replace existing components, learn structured programming by example, and manipulate sophisticated models from the outset.
