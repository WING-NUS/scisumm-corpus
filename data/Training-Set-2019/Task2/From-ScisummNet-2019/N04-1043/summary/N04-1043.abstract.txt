We present a technique for augmenting annotated training data with hierarchical word clusters that are automatically derived from a large unannotated corpus.
Cluster membership is encoded in features that are incorporated in a discriminatively trained tagging model.
Active learning is used to select training examples.
We evaluate the technique for named-entity tagging.
Compared with a state-of-the-art HMM-based name finder, the presented technique requires only 13% as much annotated data to achieve the same level of performance.
Given a large annotated training set of 1,000,000 words, the technique achieves a 25% reduction in error over the state-of-the-art HMM trained on the same material.
