We develop a framework for formalizing semantic construction within grammars expressed in typed feature structure logics, including HPSG.
The approach provides an alternative to the lambda calculus; it maintains much of the desirable flexibility of unification- based approaches to composition, while constraining the allowable operations in order to capture basic generalizations and improve maintainability.
