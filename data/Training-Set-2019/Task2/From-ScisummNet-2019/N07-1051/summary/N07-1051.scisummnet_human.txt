Improved Inference for Unlexicalized Parsing
We present several improvements to unlexicalized parsing with hierarchically state-split PCFGs.
First, we present a novel coarse-to-fine method in which a grammar's own hierarchical projections are used for incremental pruning, including a method for efficiently computing projections of a grammar without a treebank.
In our experiments, hierarchical pruning greatly accelerates parsing with no loss in empirical accuracy.
Second, we compare various inference procedures for state-split PCFGs from the standpoint of risk minimization, paying particular attention to their practical tradeoffs.
Finally, we present multilingual experiments which show that parsing with hierarchical state-splitting is fast and accurate in multiple languages and domains, even without any language-specific tuning.
An approach found to be effective for coarse-to-fine parsing is to use likelihood-based hierarchical EM training.
