We present a web mining method for discovering and enhancing relationships in which a specified concept (word class) participates.
We discover a whole range of relationships focused on the given concept, rather than generic known relationships as in most previous work.
Our method is based on clustering patterns that contain concept words and other words related to them.
We evaluate the method on three different rich concepts and find that in each case the method generates a broad variety of relationships with good precision.
