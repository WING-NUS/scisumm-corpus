This paper describes the referring expression generation mechanisms used in EPICURE, a computer program which produces natural language descriptions of cookery recipes.
Major features of the system include: an underlying ontology which permits the representation of non-singular entities; a notion of discriminatory power, to determine what properties should be used in a description; and a PATR-like unification grammar to produce surface linguistic strings.
