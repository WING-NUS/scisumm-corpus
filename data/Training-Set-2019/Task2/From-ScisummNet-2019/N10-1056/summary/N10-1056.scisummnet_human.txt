For the sake of simplicity: Unsupervised extraction of lexical simplifications from Wikipedia
We report on work in progress on extracting lexical simplifications (e.g., “collaborate” → “work together”), focusing on utilizing edit histories in Simple English Wikipedia for this task.
We consider two main approaches: (1) deriving simplification probabilities via an edit model that accounts for a mixture of different operations, and (2) using metadata to focus on edits that are more likely to be simplification operations.
We find our methods to outperform a reasonable baseline and yield many high-quality lexical simplifications not included in an independently-created manually prepared list.
We learn lexical simplifications without taking syntactic context into account.
