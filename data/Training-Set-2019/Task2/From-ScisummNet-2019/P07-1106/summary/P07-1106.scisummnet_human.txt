Chinese Segmentation with a Word-Based Perceptron Algorithm
Standard approaches to Chinese word segmentation treat the problem as a tagging task, assigning labels to the characters in the sequence indicating whether the character marks a word boundary.
Discriminatively trained models based on local character features are used to make the tagging decisions, with Viterbi decoding finding the highest scoring segmentation.
In this paper we propose an alternative, word-based segmentor, which uses features based on complete words and word sequences.
The generalized perceptron algorithm is used for discriminative training, and we use a beam-search decoder.
Closed tests on the first and second SIGHAN bakeoffs show that our system is competitive with the best in the literature, achieving the highest reported F-scores for a number of corpora.
We also provide a feature template for Chinese word segmentation.
