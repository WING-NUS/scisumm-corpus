We have aligned Japanese and English news articles and sentences to make a large parallel corpus.
We first used a method based on cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) to align the Japanese and English articles and then used a method based on dynamic programming (DP) matching to align the Japanese and English sentences in these articles.
However, the results included many incorrect alignments.
To remove these, we propose two measures (scores) that evaluate the validity of alignments.
The measure for article alignment uses similarities in sentences aligned by DP matching and that for sentence alignment uses similarities in articles aligned by CLIR.
They enhance each other to improve the accuracy of alignment.
Using these measures, we have successfully constructed a large-scale article and sentence alignment corpus available to the public.
