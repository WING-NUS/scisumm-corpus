Structural Disambiguation With Constraint Propagation
We present a new grammatical formalism called Constraint Dependency Grammar (CDG) in which every grammatical rule is given as a constraint on word-to-word modifications.
CDG parsing is formalized as a constraint satisfaction problem over a finite domain so that efficient constraint-propagation algorithms can be employed to reduce structural ambiguity without generating individual parse trees.
The weak generative capacity and the computational complexity of CDG parsing are also discussed.
Our constraint dependency grammar maps to the notation of constratin satisfaction techniques.
