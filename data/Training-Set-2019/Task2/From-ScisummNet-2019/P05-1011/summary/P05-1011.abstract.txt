This paper reports the development of log-linear models for the disambiguation in wide-coverage HPSG parsing.
The estimation of log-linear models requires high computational cost, especially with wide-coverage grammars.
Using techniques to reduce the estimation cost, we trained the models using 20 sections of Penn Treebank.
A series of experiments empirically evaluated the estimation techniques, and also examined the performance of the disambiguation models on the parsing of real-world sentences.
