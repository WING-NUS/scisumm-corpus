Recent research presents conflicting evidence on whether word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems can help to improve the performance of statistical machine translation (MT) systems.
In this paper, we successfully integrate a state-of-the-art WSD system into a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based MT system, Hiero.
We show for the first time that integrating a WSD system improves the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical MT system on an actual translation task.
Furthermore, the improvement is statistically significant.
