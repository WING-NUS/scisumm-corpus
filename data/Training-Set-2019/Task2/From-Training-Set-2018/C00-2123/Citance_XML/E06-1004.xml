Brown and his colleagues developed a series of 5 translation models which have become to be known in the field of machine translation as IBM models.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">For a detailed introduction to IBM translation models, please see (Brown et al., 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">In practice, models 35 are known to give good results and models 12 are used to seed the EM iterations of the higher models.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">IBM model 3 is the prototypical translation model and it models P r(f , a|e) as follows: (e∗, a∗) = argmax P (f , a|e) P (e) (e,a) Viterbi Alignment computation finds applications not only in SMT but also in other areas of Natural Language Processing (Wang, 1998), (Marcu, 2002).</S>

			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">The computational tasks involving IBM Models are the following: • Viterbi Alignment Given the model parameters and a sentence pair (f , e), determine the most probable alignment between f and e. a∗ = argmax P (f , a|e) a • Expectation Evaluation This forms the core of model training via the EM algorithm.</S>

			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">Exact Decoding is the original decoding problem as defined in (Brown et al., 1993) and Relaxed Decoding is the relaxation of the decoding problem typically used in practice.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">While several heuristics have been developed by practitioners of SMT for the computational tasks involving IBM models, not much is known about the computational complexity of these tasks.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">In their seminal paper on SMT, Brown and his colleagues highlighted the problems we face as we go from IBM Models 12 to 35(Brown et al., 1993) 3: “As we progress from Model 1 to Model 5, evaluating the expectations that gives us counts becomes increasingly difficult.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">In Models 3 and 4, we must be content with approximate EM iterations because it is not feasible to carry out sums over all possible alignments for these models.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">In practice, we are never sure that we have found the Viterbi alignment”.</S>

			<S sid ="199" ssid = "163">There are three different ways of dealing with the computational barrier posed by our problems.</S>
			<S sid ="200" ssid = "164">The first of these is to develop a restricted fertility model that permits polynomial time computations.</S>
			<S sid ="201" ssid = "165">It remains to be found what kind of parameterized distributions are suitable for this purpose.</S>
			<S sid ="202" ssid = "166">The second approach is to develop provably good approximation algorithms for these problems as is done with many NP-Hard and #P-Hard problems.</S>
			<S sid ="203" ssid = "167">Provably good approximation algorithms exist for several covering problems including Set Cover and Vertex Cover.</S>
			<S sid ="204" ssid = "168">Viterbi Alignment is itself a special type of covering problem and it remains to be seen whether some of the techniques developed for covering algorithms are useful for finding good approximations to Viterbi Alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="205" ssid = "169">Similarly, there exist several techniques for approximating the permanent of a matrix.</S>
			<S sid ="206" ssid = "170">It needs to be explored if some of these ideas can be adapted for Expectation Evaluation.</S>

			<S sid ="209" ssid = "173">Our results answer several open questions on the computation of Viterbi Alignment and Expectation Evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="210" ssid = "174">Unless P = NP and P#P = P, there can be no polynomial time algorithms for either of these problems.</S>
			<S sid ="211" ssid = "175">The evaluation of expectations becomes increasingly difficult as we go from IBM Models 12 to Models 35 exactly because the problem is #P-Complete for the latter models.</S>
			<S sid ="212" ssid = "176">There cannot be any trick for IBM Models 35 that would help us carry out the sums over all possible alignments exactly.</S>
			<S sid ="213" ssid = "177">There cannot exist a closed form expression (whose representation is polynomial in the size of the input) for P (f |e) and the counts in the EM iterations for Models 35.</S>
			<S sid ="214" ssid = "178">It should be noted that the computation of Viterbi Alignment and Expectation Evaluation is easy for Models 12.</S>
			<S sid ="215" ssid = "179">What makes these computations hard for Models 35?</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "180">To answer this question, we observe that Models 12 lack explicit fertility model unlike Models 35.</S>
			<S sid ="217" ssid = "181">In the former models, fertility probabilities are determined by the subspace.</S>
			<S sid ="218" ssid = "182">To be useful such large subspaces should also admit optimal polynomial time algorithms for the problems we have discussed in this paper.</S>
			<S sid ="219" ssid = "183">This is exactly the approach taken by (Udupa, 2005) for solving the decoding and Viterbi alignment problems.</S>
			<S sid ="220" ssid = "184">They show that very efficient polynomial time algorithms can be developed for both Decoding and Viterbi Alignment problems.</S>
			<S sid ="221" ssid = "185">Not only the algorithms are provably superior in a computational complexity sense, (Udupa, 2005) are also able to get substantial improvements in BLEU and NIST scores over the Greedy decoder.</S>
			<S sid ="222" ssid = "186">5 Conclusions.</S>
			<S sid ="223" ssid = "187">IBM models 35 are widely used in SMT.</S>
			<S sid ="224" ssid = "188">The computational tasks discussed in this work form the backbone of all SMT systems that use IBM models.</S>
			<S sid ="225" ssid = "189">We believe that our results on the computational complexity of the tasks in SMT will result in a better understanding of these tasks from a theoretical perspective.</S>
			<S sid ="226" ssid = "190">We also believe that our results may help in the design of effective heuristics for some of these tasks.</S>
			<S sid ="227" ssid = "191">A theoretical analysis of the commonly employed heuristics will also be of interest.An open question in SMT is whether there ex ists closed form expressions (whose representation is polynomial in the size of the input) for P (f |e) and the counts in the EM iterations for models 35 (Brown et al., 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="228" ssid = "192">For models 12, closed form expressions exist for P (f |e) and the counts in the EM iterations for models 35.</S>
			<S sid ="229" ssid = "193">Our results show that there cannot exist a closed form expression (whose representation is polynomial in the size of the input) for P (f |e) and the counts in the EM iterations for Models 35 unless P = NP.</S>
