Abstract
Training higher-order conditional random
fields is prohibitive for huge tag sets. We
present an approximated conditional random
field using coarse-to-fine decoding and early
updating. We show that our implementation
yields fast and accurate morphological taggers
across six languages with different morpho-
logical properties and that across languages
higher-order models give significant improve-
ments over 1st-order models.
1 Introduction
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al,
2001) are arguably one of the best performing se-
quence prediction models for many Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) tasks. During CRF train-
ing forward-backward computations, a form of dy-
namic programming, dominate the asymptotic run-
time. The training and also decoding times thus
depend polynomially on the size of the tagset and
exponentially on the order of the CRF. This prob-
ably explains why CRFs, despite their outstanding
accuracy, normally only are applied to tasks with
small tagsets such as Named Entity Recognition and
Chunking; if they are applied to tasks with bigger
tagsets ? e.g., to part-of-speech (POS) tagging for
English ? then they generally are used as 1st-order
models.
In this paper, we demonstrate that fast and accu-
rate CRF training and tagging is possible for large
tagsets of even thousands of tags by approximat-
ing the CRF objective function using coarse-to-fine
decoding (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Rush and
Petrov, 2012). Our pruned CRF (PCRF) model has
much smaller runtime than higher-order CRF mod-
els and may thus lead to an even broader application
of CRFs across NLP tagging tasks.
We use POS tagging and combined POS and
morphological (POS+MORPH) tagging to demon-
strate the properties and benefits of our approach.
POS+MORPH disambiguation is an important pre-
processing step for syntactic parsing. It is
usually tackled by applying sequence prediction.
POS+MORPH tagging is also a good example of a
task where CRFs are rarely applied as the tagsets are
often so big that even 1st-order dynamic program-
ming is too expensive. A workaround is to restrict
the possible tag candidates per position by using ei-
ther morphological analyzers (MAs), dictionaries or
heuristics (Hajic?, 2000). In this paper, however we
show that when using pruning (i.e., PCRFs), CRFs
can be trained in reasonable time, which makes hard
constraints unnecessary.
In this paper, we run successful experiments on
six languages with different morphological prop-
erties; we interpret this as evidence that our ap-
proach is a general solution to the problem of
POS+MORPH tagging. The tagsets in our experi-
ments range from small sizes of 12 to large sizes of
up to 1811. We will see that even for the smallest
tagset, PCRFs need only 40% of the training time of
standard CRFs. For the bigger tagset sizes we can
reduce training times from several days to several
hours. We will also show that training higher-order
PCRF models takes only several minutes longer than
training 1st-order models and ? depending on the
language ? may lead to substantial accuracy im-

tagging, a 1st-order model (trained in 32 minutes)

POS+MORPH tagging and Section 5 summarizes

2 Methodology
2.1 Standard CRF Training
In a standard CRF we model our sentences using a
globally normalized log-linear model. The proba-
bility of a tag sequence ~y given a sentence ~x is then
given as:
p(~y|~x) =
exp
?
t,i ?i ? ?i(~y, ~x, t)
Z(~?, ~x)
Z(~?, ~x) =
?
~y
exp
?
t,i
?i ? ?i(~y, ~x, t)
Where t and i are token and feature indexes, ?i is
a feature function, ?i is a feature weight and Z is a
normalization constant. During training the feature
weights ? are set to maximize the conditional log-
likelihood of the training data D:
1Our java implementation MarMoT is available at
https://code.google.com/p/cistern/
llD(~?) =
?
(~x,~y)?D
log p(~y|~x,~?)
In order to use numerical optimization we have to
calculate the gradient of the log-likelihood, which is
a vector of partial derivatives ?llD(~?)/??i. For a
training sentence ~x, ~y and a token index t the deriva-
tive wrt feature i is given by:
?i(~y, ~x, t)?
?
~y?
?i(~y
?, ~x, t) p(~y?|~x,~?)
This is the difference between the empirical fea-
ture count in the training data and the estimated
count in the current model ~?. For a 1st-order model,
we can replace the expensive sum over all possible
tag sequences ~y? by a sum over all pairs of tags:
?i(yt, yt+1, ~x, t)?
?
y,y?
?i(y, y
?, ~x, t) p(y, y?|~x,~?)
The probability of a tag pair p(y, y?|~x,~?) can then
be calculated efficiently using the forward-backward
algorithm. If we further reduce the complexity of the
model to a 0-order model, we obtain simple maxi-
mum entropy model updates:
?i(yt, ~x, t)?
?
y
?i(y, ~x, t) p(y|~x,~?)
2.2 Pruned CRF Training
As we discussed in the introduction, we want to de-
code sentences by applying a variant of coarse-to-
fine tagging. Naively, to later tag with nth-order
323
accuracy we would train a series of n CRFs of in-
creasing order. We would then use the CRF of order
n ? 1 to restrict the input of the CRF of order n.
In this paper we approximate this approach, but do
so while training only one integrated model. This
way we can save both memory (by sharing feature
weights between different models) and training time
(by saving lower-order updates).
The main idea of our approach is to create increas-
ingly complex lattices and to filter candidate states
at every step to prevent a polynomial increase in lat-
tice size. The first step is to create a 0-order lat-
tice, which as discussed above, is identical to a se-
ries of independent local maximum entropy models
p(y|~x, t). The models base their prediction on the
current word xt and the immediate lexical context.
We then calculate the posterior probabilities and re-
move states y with p(y|~x, t) < ?0 from the lattice,
where ?0 is a parameter. The resulting reduced lat-
tice is similar to what we would obtain using candi-
date selection based on an MA.
We can now create a first order lattice by adding
transitions to the pruned lattice and pruning with
threshold ?1. The only difference to 0-order prun-
ing is that we now have to run forward-backward
to calculate the probabilities p(y|~x, t). Note that in
theory we could also apply the pruning to transition
probabilities of the form p(y, y?|~x, t); however, this
does not seem to yield more accurate models and is
less efficient than state pruning.
For higher-order lattices we merge pairs of states
into new states, add transitions and prune with
threshold ?i.
We train the model using l1-regularized Stochas-
tic Gradient Descent (SGD) (Tsuruoka et al, 2009).
We would like to create a cascade of increasingly
complex lattices and update the weight vector with
the gradient of the last lattice. The updates, how-
ever, are undefined if the gold sequence is pruned
from the lattice. A solution would be to simply rein-
sert the gold sequence, but this yields poor results
as the model never learns to keep the gold sequence
in the lower-order lattices. As an alternative we per-
form the gradient update with the highest lattice still
containing the gold sequence. This approach is sim-
ilar to ?early updating? (Collins and Roark, 2004)
in perceptron learning, where during beam search
an update with the highest scoring partial hypothe-

Figure 1: Lattice generation during training
sis is performed whenever the gold candidate falls
out of the beam. Intuitively, we are trying to opti-
mize an nth-order CRF objective function, but ap-
ply small lower-order corrections to the weight vec-
tor when necessary to keep the gold candidate in the
lattice. Figure 1 illustrates the lattice generation pro-
cess. The lattice generation during decoding is iden-
tical, except that we always return a lattice of the
highest order n.
The savings in training time of this integrated ap-
proach are large; e.g., training a maximum entropy
model over a tagset of roughly 1800 tags and more
than half a million instances is slow as we have to
apply 1800 weight vector updates for every token
in the training set and every SGD iteration. In the
integrated model we only have to apply 1800 up-
dates when we lose the gold sequence during fil-
tering. Thus, in our implementation training a 0-
order model for Czech takes roughly twice as long
as training a 1st-order model.
2.3 Threshold Estimation
Our approach would not work if we were to set the
parameters ?i to fixed predetermined values; e.g.,
the ?i depend on the size of the tagset and should
be adapted during training as we start the training
with a uniform model that becomes more specific.
We therefore set the ?i by specifying ?i, the average
number of tags per position that should remain in
the lattice after pruning. This also guarantees sta-
ble lattice sizes and thus stable training times. We
324
achieve stable average number of tags per position
by setting the ?i dynamically during training: we
measure the real average number of candidates per
position ??i and apply corrections after processing a
certain fraction of the sentences of the training set.
The updates are of the form:
?i =
{
+0.1 ? ?i if ??i < ?i
?0.1 ? ?i if ??i > ?i
Figure 2 shows an example training run for Ger-
man with ?0 = 4. Here the 0-order lattice reduces
the number of tags per position from 681 to 4 losing
roughly 15% of the gold sequences of the develop-
ment set, which means that for 85% of the sentences
the correct candidate is still in the lattice. This cor-
responds to more than 99% of the tokens. We can
also see that after two iterations only a very small
number of 0-order updates have to be performed.
2.4 Tag Decomposition
As we discussed before for the very large
POS+MORPH tagsets, most of the decoding time is
spent on the 0-order level. To decrease the number
of tag candidates in the 0-order model, we decode in
two steps by separating the fully specified tag into a
coarse-grained part-of-speech (POS) tag and a fine-
grained MORPH tag containing the morphological
features. We then first build a lattice over POS can-
didates and apply our pruning strategy. In a second
step we expand the remaining POS tags into all the
combinations with MORPH tags that were seen in
the training set. We thus build a sequence of lattices
of both increasing order and increasing tag complex-
ity.
2.5 Feature Set
We use the features of Ratnaparkhi (1996) and Man-
ning (2011): the current, preceding and succeed-
ing words as unigrams and bigrams and for rare
words prefixes and suffixes up to length 10, and
the occurrence of capital characters, digits and spe-
cial characters. We define a rare word as a word
with training set frequency ? 10. We concate-
nate every feature with the POS and MORPH tag
and every morphological feature. E.g., for the word
?der?, the POS tag art (article) and the MORPH
tag gen|sg|fem (genitive, singular, feminine) we

get the following features for the current word tem-
plate: der+art, der+gen|sg|fem, der+gen,
der+sg and der+fem.
We also use an additional binary feature, which
indicates whether the current word has been seen
with the current tag or ? if the word is rare ? whether
the tag is in a set of open tag classes. The open tag
classes are estimated by 10-fold cross validation on
the training set: We first use the folds to estimate
how often a tag is seen with an unknown word. We
then consider tags with a relative frequency ? 10?4
as open tag classes. While this is a heuristic, it is
safer to use a ?soft? heuristic as a feature in the lat-
tice than a hard constraint.
For some experiments we also use the output of a
morphological analyzer (MA). In that case we sim-
ply use every analysis of the MA as a simple nom-
inal feature. This approach is attractive because it
does not require the output of the MA and the an-
notation of the treebank to be identical; in fact, it
can even be used if treebank annotation and MA use
completely different features.
Because the weight vector dimensionality is high
for large tagsets and productive languages, we use a
hash kernel (Shi et al, 2009) to keep the dimension-
ality constant.
3 Related Work
Smith et al (2005) use CRFs for POS+MORPH tag-
ging, but use a morphological analyzer for candidate
selection. They report training times of several days
325
and that they had to use simplified models for Czech.
Several methods have been proposed to reduce
CRF training times. Stochastic gradient descent can
be applied to reduce the training time by a factor of 5
(Tsuruoka et al, 2009) and without drastic losses in
accuracy. Lavergne et al (2010) make use of feature
sparsity to significantly speed up training for mod-
erate tagset sizes (< 100) and huge feature spaces.
It is unclear if their approach would also work for
huge tag sets (> 1000).
Coarse-to-fine decoding has been successfully ap-
plied to CYK parsing where full dynamic program-
ming is often intractable when big grammars are
used (Charniak and Johnson, 2005). Weiss and
Taskar (2010) develop cascades of models of in-
creasing complexity in a framework based on per-
ceptron learning and an explicit trade-off between
accuracy and efficiency.
Kaji et al (2010) propose a modified Viterbi algo-
rithm that is still optimal but depending on task and
especially for big tag sets might be several orders of
magnitude faster. While their algorithm can be used
to produce fast decoders, there is no such modifica-
tion for the forward-backward algorithm used during
CRF training.
4 Experiments
We run POS+MORPH tagging experiments on Ara-
bic (ar), Czech (cs), Spanish (es), German (de) and
Hungarian (hu). The following table shows the type-
token (T/T) ratio, the average number of tags of ev-
ery word form that occurs more than once in the
training set (A) and the number of tags of the most
ambiguous word form (A?):

Arabic is a Semitic language with nonconcate-
native morphology. An additional difficulty is that
vowels are often not written in Arabic script. This
introduces a high number of ambiguities; on the
other hand it reduces the type-token ratio, which
generally makes learning easier. In this paper, we
work with the transliteration of Arabic provided in
the Penn Arabic Treebank. Czech is a highly inflect-
ing Slavic language with a large number of morpho-
logical features. Spanish is a Romance language.
Based on the statistics above we can see that it has
few POS+MORPH ambiguities. It is also the lan-
guage with the smallest tagset and the only language
in our setup that ? with a few exceptions ? does not
mark case. German is a Germanic language and ?
based on the statistics above ? the language with
the most ambiguous morphology. The reason is that
it only has a small number of inflectional suffixes.
The total number of nominal inflectional suffixes for
example is five. A good example for a highly am-
biguous suffix is ?en?, which is a marker for infini-
tive verb forms, for the 1st and 3rd person plural and
for the polite 2nd person singular. Additionally, it
marks plural nouns of all cases and singular nouns
in genitive, dative and accusative case.
Hungarian is a Finno-Ugric language with an ag-
glutinative morphology; this results in a high type-
token ratio, but also the lowest level of word form
ambiguity among the selected languages.
POS tagging experiments are run on all the lan-
guages above and also on English.
4.1 Resources
For Arabic we use the Penn Arabic Tree-
bank (Maamouri et al, 2004), parts 1?3 in
their latest versions (LDC2010T08, LDC2010T13,
LDC2011T09). As training set we use parts 1 and 2
and part 3 up to section ANN20020815.0083. All
consecutive sections up to ANN20021015.0096
are used as development set and the remainder as
test set. We use the unvocalized and pretokenized
transliterations as input. For Czech and Spanish,
we use the CoNLL 2009 data sets (Hajic? et al,
2009); for German, the TIGER treebank (Brants et
al., 2002) with the split from Fraser et al (2013);
for Hungarian, the Szeged treebank (Csendes et al,
2005) with the split from Farkas et al (2012). For
English we use the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al,
1993) with the split from Toutanova et al (2003).
We also compute the possible POS+MORPH tags
for every word using MAs. For Arabic we use the
AraMorph reimplementation of Buckwalter (2002),
for Czech the ?free? morphology (Hajic?, 2001), for
Spanish Freeling (Padro? and Stanilovsky, 2012), for
German DMOR (Schiller, 1995) and for Hungarian

Magyarlanc 2.0 (Zsibrita et al, 2013).
4.2 Setup
To compare the training and decoding times we run
all experiments on the same test machine, which fea-
tures two Hexa-Core Intel Xeon X5680 CPUs with
3,33 GHz and 6 cores each and 144 GB of mem-
ory. The baseline tagger and our PCRF implemen-
tation are run single threaded.2 The taggers are im-
plemented in different programming languages and
with different degrees of optimization; still, the run
times are indicative of comparative performance to
be expected in practice.
Our Java implementation is always run with 10
SGD iterations and a regularization parameter of
0.1, which for German was the optimal value out of
{0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0}. We follow Tsuruoka et al (2009)
in our implementation of SGD and shuffle the train-
ing set between epochs. All numbers shown are av-
erages over 5 independent runs. Where not noted
otherwise, we use ?0 = 4, ?1 = 2 and ?2 = 1.5.
We found that higher values do not consistently in-
crease performance on the development set, but re-
sult in much higher training times.
4.3 POS Experiments
In a first experiment we evaluate the speed and ac-
curacy of CRFs and PCRFs on the POS tagsets.
As shown in Table 1 the tagset sizes range from
12 for Czech and Spanish to 54 and 57 for Ger-
man and Hungarian, with Arabic (38) and English
(45) in between. The results of our experiments are
given in Table 2. For the 1st-order models, we ob-
serve speed-ups in training time from 2.3 to 31 at no
loss in accuracy. For all languages, training pruned
higher-order models is faster than training unpruned
1st-order models and yields more accurate models.
Accuracy improvements range from 0.08 for Hun-
garian to 0.25 for German. We can conclude that
for small and medium tagset sizes PCRFs give sub-
stantial improvements in both training and decod-
ing speed3 and thus allow for higher-order tagging,
2Our tagger might actually use more than one core because
the Java garbage collection is run in parallel.

separately.
which for all languages leads to significant4 accu-
racy improvements.
4.4 POS+MORPH Oracle Experiments
Ideally, for the full POS+MORPH tagset we would
also compare our results to an unpruned CRF, but
our implementation turned out to be too slow to do
the required number of experiments. For German,
the model processed ? 0.1 sentences per second
during training; so running 10 SGD iterations on
the 40,472 sentences would take more than a month.
We therefore compare our model against models that
perform oracle pruning, which means we perform
standard pruning, but always keep the gold candi-
date in the lattice. The oracle pruning is applied dur-
ing training and testing on the development set. The
oracle model performance is thus an upper bound for
the performance of an unpruned CRF.
The most interesting pruning step happens at the
0-order level when we reduce from hundreds of can-
didates to just a couple. Table 3 shows the results for
1st-order CRFs.
We can roughly group the five languages into
three groups: for Spanish and Hungarian the dam-
age is negligible, for Arabic we see a small decrease
of 0.07 and only for Czech and German we observe
considerable differences of 0.14 and 0.37. Surpris-
ingly, doubling the number of candidates per posi-
tion does not lead to significant improvements.
We can conclude that except for Czech and Ger-
man losses due to pruning are insignificant.
4.5 POS+MORPH Higher-Order Experiments
One argument for PCRFs is that while they might
be less accurate than standard CRFs they allow to
train higher-order models, which in turn might be
more accurate than their standard lower-order coun-
terparts. In this section, we investigate how big the
improvements of higher-order models are. The re-
sults are given in the following table:

We see that 2nd-order models give improvements for
all languages. For Spanish and Hungarian we see
minor improvements ? 0.1.
For Czech we see a moderate improvement of
0.61 and for Arabic and German we observe sub-
stantial improvements of 0.96 and 1.31. An analysis
on the development set revealed that for all three lan-
guages, case is the morphological feature that bene-
fits most from higher-order models. A possible ex-
planation is that case has a high correlation with syn-
tactic relations and is thus affected by long-distance
dependencies.
German is the only language where fourgram
models give an additional improvement over trigram
models. The reason seem to be sentences with long-
range dependencies, e.g., ?Die Rebellen haben kein
Lo?segeld verlangt? (The rebels have not demanded
any ransom); ?verlangt? (demanded) is a past partic-
ple that is separated from the auxilary verb ?haben?
(have). The 2nd-order model does not consider
enough context and misclassifies ?verlangt? as a fi-
nite verb form, while the 3rd-order model tags it cor-
rectly.
We can also conclude that the improvements for
higher-order models are always higher than the loss
we estimated in the oracle experiments. More pre-
cisely we see that if a language has a low number of
word form ambiguities (e.g., Hungarian) we observe
a small loss during 0-order pruning but we also have
to expect less of an improvement when increasing
the order of the model. For languages with a high
number of word form ambiguities (e.g., German) we
must anticipate some loss during 0-order pruning,
but we also see substantial benefits for higher-order
models.
Surprisingly, we found that higher-order PCRF
models can also avoid the pruning errors of lower-
order models. Here is an example from the German
data. The word ?Januar? (January) is ambiguous: in
the training set, it occurs 108 times as dative, 9 times
as accusative and only 5 times as nominative. The
development set contains 48 nominative instances of
?Januar? in datelines at the end of news articles, e.g.,
?TEL AVIV, 3. Januar?. For these 48 occurrences,
(i) the oracle model in Table 3 selects the correct
case nominative, (ii) the 1st-order PCRF model se-
lects the incorrect case accusative, and (iii) the 2nd-
and 3rd-order models select ? unlike the 1st-order
model ? the correct case nominative. Our interpreta-
tion is that the correct nominative reading is pruned
from the 0-order lattice. However, the higher-order
models can put less weight on 0-order features as
they have access to more context to disambiguate the
sequence. The lower weights of order-0 result in a
more uniform posterior distribution and the nomina-
tive reading is not pruned from the lattice.

Plus and minus indicate models that are signif-
icantly better or worse than MA1. We can see
that the improvements due to higher-order models
are orthogonal to the improvements due to MAs
for all languages. This was to be expected as
MAs provide additional lexical knowledge while
higher-order models provide additional information
about the context. For Arabic and German the
improvements of higher-order models are bigger
than the improvements due to MAs.
4.7 Comparison with Baselines
We use the following baselines: SVMTool
(Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2004), an SVM-based dis-
criminative tagger; RFTagger (Schmid and Laws,
2008), an n-gram Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
tagger developed for POS+MORPH tagging; Mor-
fette (Chrupa?a et al, 2008), an averaged percep-
tron with beam search decoder; CRFSuite (Okazaki,
2007), a fast CRF implementation; and the Stanford
Tagger (Toutanova et al, 2003), a bidirectional Max-
imum Entropy Markov Model. For POS+MORPH
tagging, all baselines are trained on the concatena-
tion of POS tag and MORPH tag. We run SVM-
Tool with the standard feature set and the optimal
c-values ? {0.1, 1, 10}. Morfette is run with the de-
fault options. For CRFSuite we use l2-regularized
SGD training. We use the optimal regularization pa-
rameter ? {0.01, 0.1, 1.0} and stop after 30 itera-
tions where we reach a relative improvement in reg-
ularized likelihood of at most 0.01 for all languages.
The feature set is identical to our model except for
some restrictions: we only use concatenations with
the full tag and we do not use the binary feature that
indicates whether a word-tag combination has been
observed. We also had to restrict the combinations
of tag and features to those observed in the training
set5. Otherwise the memory requirements would ex-
ceed the memory of our test machine (144 GB) for
Czech and Hungarian. The Stanford Tagger is used
5We set the CRFSuite option possible states = 0
as a bidirectional 2nd-order model and trained us-
ing OWL-BFGS. For Arabic, German and English
we use the language specific feature sets and for the
other languages the English feature set.
Development set results for POS tagging are
shown in Table 4. We can observe that Morfette,
CRFSuite and the PCRF models for different orders
have training times in the same order of magnitude.
For Arabic, Czech and English, the PCRF accuracy
is comparable to the best baseline models. For the
other languages we see improvements of 0.13 for
Spanish, 0.18 for Hungarian and 0.24 for German.
Evaluation on the test set confirms these results, see
Table 5.6
The POS+MORPH tagging development set re-
sults are presented in Table 6. Morfette is the fastest
discriminative baseline tagger. In comparison with
Morfette the speed up for 3rd-order PCRFs lies be-
tween 1.7 for Czech and 5 for Arabic. Morfette
gives the best baseline results for Arabic, Spanish
and Hungarian and CRFSuite for Czech and Ger-
man. The accuracy improvements of the best PCRF
models over the best baseline models range from
0.27 for Spanish over 0.58 for Hungarian, 1.91 for
Arabic, 1.96 for Czech to 2.82 for German. The test
set experiments in Table 7 confirm these results.
5 Conclusion
We presented the pruned CRF (PCRF) model for
very large tagsets. The model is based on coarse-to-
fine decoding and stochastic gradient descent train-
ing with early updating. We showed that for mod-
erate tagset sizes of ? 50, the model gives signif-
icant speed-ups over a standard CRF with negligi-
ble losses in accuracy. Furthermore, we showed that
training and tagging for approximated trigram and
fourgram models is still faster than standard 1st-
order tagging, but yields significant improvements
in accuracy.
In oracle experiments with POS+MORPH tagsets
we demonstrated that the losses due to our approx-
imation depend on the word level ambiguity of the
respective language and are moderate (? 0.14) ex-
cept for German where we observed a loss of 0.37.
6Gime?nez and Ma`rquez (2004) report an accuracy of 97.16
instead of 97.12 for SVMTool for English and Manning (2011)
an accuracy of 97.29 instead of 97.28 for the Stanford tagger.
330
We also showed that higher order tagging ? which
is prohibitive for standard CRF implementations ?
yields significant improvements over unpruned 1st-
order models. Analogous to the oracle experiments
we observed big improvements for languages with a
high level of POS+MORPH ambiguity such as Ger-
man and smaller improvements for languages with
less ambiguity such as Hungarian and Spanish.
