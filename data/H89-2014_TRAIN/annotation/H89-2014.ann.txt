A 30,000 word dictionary was used, supplemented by inflectional analysis for words not found directly in the dictionary. In the document, 142 words were tagged as unknown (their possible categories were not known). A total of 1,526 words had ambiguous categories (i.e. 40% of the document). Critical examination of the tagging provided by the augmented model showed 168 word tagging errors, whereas the basic model gave 215 erroneous word tags. The former represents 95.6% correct word tagging on the text as a whole (ignoring unknown words), and 89% on the ambiguous words | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  Kokil Jaidka, NTU |
