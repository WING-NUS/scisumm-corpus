In a system where FS unification is applied, there are features whose values fail relatively often in unification with other values and there are features whose values do not fail so often. For example, in Japanese sentence analysis, unification of features for conjugation forms, case markers, and semantic selectional restrictions tends to fail but unification of features for semantic representations does not fail. In such cases, application of the EF F strategy, that is, treating features tending to fall in unification first, reduces unnecessary computation when the unification finally fails | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  Kokil Jaidka, NTU |

[Kogure 90], the key idea of avoiding "redundant copying" is to do copying lazily ... Kogure uses a revised copynode procedure which maintains copy dependency information in order to avoid immediate copying ... Similarly, in Kogure's approach, not all redundant copying is avoided in cases where there exists a feature path (a sequence of nodes connected by arcs) to a node that needs to be copied. All the nodes along such a path must be copied, even if they are not affected by the unification procedure. Furthermore, special copy dependency information has to be maintained while copying nodes in order to trigger copying of such arc sequences leading to a node where copying is needed later in the process of unification. In addition to the overhead of storing copy dependency information, a second traversal of the set of dependent nodes is required for actually performing the copying. This copying itself might eventually trigger further copying of new dependent nodes | Reference Offset:  ['3828-3878', '20067-20252'] | Reference Text:  Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying ...
