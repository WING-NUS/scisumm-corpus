			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Various kinds of grammatical formalisms without t,ranstormation were proposed from the late 1970s I;hrough the 1980s l(]azder eL al 85, l(aplan and Bresnan 82, Kay 1~5, Pollm&apos;d and Sag 871.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">These furnmlisms were developed relatively independentIy but actually had common properties; th&apos;~t is, they used data structures called ftmctional structures or feature structures and they were based on unilieathm operation on these data structures.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">These formalisms were applied in the field of natural language processing and, based on these formalisms, ~:~ystems such as machine translation systems were developed [l&lt;ol;u, e et a l 8gJ.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">In such unification-based formalisms, feature ~trueture (FS) unification is the most fundamental and ..~ignifieant operation.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">The efficiency of systems based on ..~uch formalisms, such as natural language analysis and generation systems very much depends on their FS ~lnifieatlon efficiencies.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Tiffs dependency is especially crucial for lexicon-driven approaches such as tlPSO[Pollard and Sag 861 and JPSG[Gunji 871 because rich lexieal information and phrase structure information is described in terms of FSs.</S>

			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Japanese analysis system based on llPSG[Kogure 891 uses 90% - 98% of the elapsed time in FS unification.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Several FS unificatioa methods were proposed in IKarttunen 86, l&apos;ereira 85, Wroblewski 871.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">These methods uses rooted directed graphs (DGs) to represent FSs.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">These methods take two DGs as their inputs and give a unification result DG.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Previous research identified DG copying as a significant overhead.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Wroblewski claims that copying is wrong when an algorithm copies too much (over copying) or copies too soon (early copying).</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Ile proposed an incremental copy graph unification method to avoid over copying and early copying.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">itowever, the problem with his method is that a unitication result graph consists only of newly created structures.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">This is unnecessary because there are often input snbgraphs that can be used as part of the result graph without any modification, or as sharable parts between one of the input graphs and the result graph.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">A better method would nfinimize the copying of sharable varts.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">The redundantly copied parts are relatively large when input graphs have few common feature paths.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">In natural language processing, such cases are ubiquitous.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">I&quot;or example, in unifying an FS representing constraints on phrase structures and an FS representing a daughter phrase structure, such eases occur very h&apos;equent, ly.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">In Kasper&apos;s disjunctive feature description unification [Kasper 861, such cases occur very h&apos;equently in unifying definite and disjunct&apos;s definite parts.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Memory is wasted by such redundant copying and this causes frequent garbage collection and page swapping which decrease the total system efficiency.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">I)eveloping a method which avoids memory wastage is very important.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">Pereira&apos;s structure sharing FS unification method can avoid this problem.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">The method achieves structure sharing by importing the Bayer and Moore approach for term structurestl~oyer and Moore 721.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">The method uses a data structure consisting of a skeleton part to represent original information and an environment part to represent updated information.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">3&apos;he skeleton part is shared by one of the input FSs and the result FS.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">Therefore, Pereira&apos;s method needs relatively few new structures when two input FSs are difference in size and which input is larger are known before unification.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">However, Pereira&apos;s method can create skeleton-enviromnent structures that are deeply embedded, for example, in reeursively constructing large phrase structure fl&apos;om their parts.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">This causes O(log d) graph node access time overhead in assembling the whole DG from the skeleton and environments where d is the number of nodes in the DG.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">Avoiding this problem in his method requires a special operation of merging a skeleton-environment structure into a skeleton structure, but this prevents structure sharing.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">This paper proposes an FS unification method that allows structure sharing with constant m&apos;der node access time.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">This method achieves structure sharing by introducing lazy copying to Wroblewski&apos;s incremental copy graph unification method.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "41">The method is called the lazy i2!cremental copy IFaph unification reel, hod (the LING unifieation method for short).</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "42">In a natural language proeessing system that uses deelarative constraint rules in terms of FSs, FS unification provides constraint-checking and structure- building mechanisms.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "43">The advantages of such a system include: (1)rule writers are not required to describe control infimnation such as eonstraiut application order in a rule, and (12)rule descriptions can be used iu different processing directions, i.e., analysis and general,ion.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "44">However, these advantages in describing rules are disadvantages in applying them because of tt~e lack of control information.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "45">For example, when constructing a phrase structure from its parts (e.g., a sentence fi&apos;om a subject NP and VP), unueeessary computation can be reduced if the semantic representation is assembled after checking constraints such as grammatical agreements, which can fail.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "46">This is impossible in straightforward unification-based formalisms.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "47">In contrast, in a procedure-based system which uses IF-TItEN style rules (i.e., consisting of explicit test and structure-building operations), it is possible to construct the semantic representation (TIIEN par&apos;g) after checking the agreement (IF part).</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "48">Such a system has the advantage of processing efficiency but the disadvantage of lacking multidirectionality.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "49">In this paper, some of the efficiency of the procedure- based system is introduced into an FS unification-based system.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "50">That is, an FS unification method is proposed that introduces a strategy called the e_arly failure £inding strategy (the EFF strategy) to make FS unification efficient, in this method, FS unification orders are not specified explicitly by rule wril.ers, but are controlled by learned information on tendencies of FS constraint application failures.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "51">This method is called the strategic ij!~crementaI copy graph unification method (the SING unification method).</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "52">These two methods can be combined into a single method called the strategic lazy ijAcremeatal copy g~raph unification method (the SLING unification method).</S>

			<S sid ="150" ssid = "11">It then adds the arc copies and arcs of node/&apos; that are not copied to the new node, and returns the new node; (3) otherwise, CopyNode adds the pair consisting of the ancestor node node2 and the are arcl into the COPY- DEPENDENCY slot of node 1&quot; and returns Nil_.</S>

			<S sid ="179" ssid = "1">Method In a system where FS unification is applied, there are features whose values fail relatively often in unification with other values and there are features whose values do not fail so often.</S>
			<S sid ="180" ssid = "2">For example, in Japanese sentence analysis, unification of features for conjugation forms, case markers, and semantic selectional restrictions tends to fail but unification of features for semantic representations does not fail.</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "3">In such cases, application of the EFF strategy, that is, treating features tending to fall in unification first, reduces unnecessary computation when the unification finally fails.</S>
			<S sid ="182" ssid = "4">For example, when unification of features for case markers does fail, treating these features first avoids treating features for senmntic representations.</S>
			<S sid ="183" ssid = "5">The SING unification method uses this failure tendency infornmtion.</S>
			<S sid ="184" ssid = "6">These unification failure tendencies depend on systems such as analysis systems or generation systems.</S>
			<S sid ="185" ssid = "7">Unlike the analysis case, unification of features for semantic representations tends to fail.</S>
			<S sid ="186" ssid = "8">in this method, theretbre, the failure tendency information is acquired by a learning process.</S>
			<S sid ="187" ssid = "9">That is, the SING unification method applied in an analysis system uses the failure tendency information acquired by a learning analysis process.</S>
			<S sid ="188" ssid = "10">in the learning process, when FS unification is applied, feature treatment orders are randomized for the sake of random extraction.</S>
			<S sid ="189" ssid = "11">As in TFS unification, failure tendency information is recorded in terms of a triplet consisting of the greatest lower bound type symbol of the input TFSs&apos; type symbols, a feature and success/failure flag.</S>
			<S sid ="190" ssid = "12">This is because the type symbol of a &apos;rFS represents salient information on the whole TFS.</S>
			<S sid ="191" ssid = "13">By using learned failure tendency information, feature value unification is applied in an order that first treats features with the greatest tendency to fail.</S>
			<S sid ="192" ssid = "14">This is achieved by the sorting procedure of common label arc pairs attached to the meet type symbol.</S>
			<S sid ="193" ssid = "15">The arc pairs obtained by the SharedArcs procedure are sorted before treating arcs.</S>
			<S sid ="194" ssid = "16">The efficiency of the SING unification method depends on the following factors: (1) The overall FS unification failure rate of the process: in extreme cases, if Go unification failure occurs, the method has no advantages except the overhead of feature unification order sorting.</S>
			<S sid ="195" ssid = "17">However, such cases do not occur in practice.</S>
			<S sid ="196" ssid = "18">(2) Number of features FSs have: if each FS has only a small number of features, the efficiency gain from the SING unification method is small.</S>
			<S sid ="197" ssid = "19">(3) Unevenness of FS unification failure tendency: in extreme cases, if every feature has the same unification failure tendency, this method has no advantage.</S>
			<S sid ="198" ssid = "20">However, such cases do not occur or are very rare, and for example, in many cases of natural language analysis, FS unification failures occur in treating only limited kinds of features related to grammatical agreement such as number and/or person agreement and semantic selectional constraints.</S>
			<S sid ="199" ssid = "21">In such cases, the SING unification method obtains efl]ciency gains.</S>
			<S sid ="200" ssid = "22">The above factors can be examined by inspecting failure tendency information, from which the efficiency gain from the SING method can be predicted.</S>
			<S sid ="201" ssid = "23">Moreover, it is possible for each type symbol to select whether to apply feature unification order sorting or not.</S>

			<S sid ="202" ssid = "1">The strategic lazy incremental copy graph (SLING) unification method combines two incremental copy graph unification methods: the lazy incremental copy graph (LING) unification method and the strategic incremental copy graph (SING) unification method.</S>
			<S sid ="203" ssid = "2">The LING unification method achieves structure sharing without the O(log d) data access overhead of Pereira&apos;s method.</S>
			<S sid ="204" ssid = "3">Structure sharing avoids memory wastage&apos;.</S>
			<S sid ="205" ssid = "4">Furthermore, structure sharing increases the portion of token identical substructures of FSs which makes it efficient to keep unification results of substructures of FSs and reuse them.</S>
			<S sid ="206" ssid = "5">This reduces repeated calculation of substructures.</S>
			<S sid ="207" ssid = "6">The SING unification method introduces the concept of feature unification strategy.</S>
			<S sid ="208" ssid = "7">&apos;the method treats features tending to fail in unification first.</S>
			<S sid ="209" ssid = "8">Thus, the efficiency gain fi&apos;om this method is high when the overall FS unification failure rate of the application process is high.</S>
			<S sid ="210" ssid = "9">The combined method Inakes each FS unification efficient and also reduces garbage collection and page swapping occurrences by avoiding memory wastage, thus increasing the total efficiency of li&apos;S unification-based natural language processing systems such aa analysis and generation systems based on IlI&apos;SG.</S>
