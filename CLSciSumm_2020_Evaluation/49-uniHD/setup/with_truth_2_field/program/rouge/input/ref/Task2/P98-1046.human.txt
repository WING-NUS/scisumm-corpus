In this paper the authors specifically address questions of polysemy of verbs and how regular extensions can be achieved. Current approaches to English classification, Levin classes and WordNet, have limitations in their applicability, thus they present a refined intersective Levin classes, which is a more fine-grained classification and have more coherece in syntactic and semantic frames. We have also examined related classes in Portuguese. They have also examined a mapping between the English verbs and their Portuguese translations, by using resources such as dictionaries and on-line corpora to investigate potential additional members of the verb classes. This implementation has given them maximum success.
