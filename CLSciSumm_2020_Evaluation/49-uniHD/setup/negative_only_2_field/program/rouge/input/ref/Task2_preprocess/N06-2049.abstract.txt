<S sid ="0">Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">In addition, the latter can be used to balance out-of-vocabulary rates and in-vocabulary rates.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">By these techniques we achieved higher F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.</S>
