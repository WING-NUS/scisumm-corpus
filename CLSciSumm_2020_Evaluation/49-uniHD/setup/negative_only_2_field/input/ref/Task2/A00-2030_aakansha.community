    <S sid=""50"" ssid=""10"">Figure 4 shows an example of the semantic annotation, which was the only type of manual annotation we performed.</S>"
<S sid="10" ssid="8">Instead, our parsing algorithm, trained on the UPenn TREEBANK, was run on the New York Times source to create unsupervised syntactic training which was constrained to be consistent with semantic annotation.</S
<S sid="16" ssid="6">For the following example, the The Template Relations (TR) task involves identifying instances of three relations in the text: TR builds on TE in that TR reports binary relations between elements of TE.</S>
"<S sid=""23"" ssid=""6"">An integrated model can limit the propagation of errors by making all decisions jointly.</S>
    <S sid=""24"" ssid=""7"">For this reason, we focused on designing an integrated model in which tagging, namefinding, parsing, and semantic interpretation decisions all have the opportunity to mutually influence each other.</S>"
