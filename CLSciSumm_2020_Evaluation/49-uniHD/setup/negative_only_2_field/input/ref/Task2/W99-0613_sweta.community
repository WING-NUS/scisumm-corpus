In fact, Zco provides a bound on the sum of the classification error of the labeled examples and the number of disagreements between the two classifiers on the unlabeled examples.</S>
 <S sid="108" ssid="41">In the cotraining case, (Blum and Mitchell 98) argue that the task should be to induce functions Ii and f2 such that So Ii and 12 must (1) correctly classify the labeled examples, and (2) must agree with each other on the unlabeled examples.</S>
