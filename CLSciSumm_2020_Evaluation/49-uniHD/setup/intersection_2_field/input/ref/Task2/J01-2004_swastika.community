<S sid="15" ssid="3">In the past few years, however, some improvements have been made over these language models through the use of statistical methods of natural language processing, and the development of innovative, linguistically well-motivated techniques for improving language models for speech recognition is generating more interest among computational linguists.</S>
    <S sid="31" ssid="19">Thus, our top-down parser allows for the incremental calculation of generative conditional word probabilities, a property it shares with other left-to-right parsers with rooted derivations such as Earley parsers (Earley 1970) or left-corner parsers (Rosenkrantz and Lewis 11 1970).</S>
<S sid="215" ssid="119">The first word in the string remaining to be parsed, w1, we will call the look-ahead word.</S>
    <S sid="302" ssid="58">In the beam search approach outlined above, we can estimate the string's probability in the same manner, by summing the probabilities of the parses that the algorithm finds.</S>

    <S sid="100" ssid="4">The approach that we will subsequently present uses the probabilistic grammar as its language model, but only includes probability mass from those parses that are found, that is, it uses the parser to find a subset of the total set of parses (hopefully most of the high-probability parses) and uses the sum of their probabilities as an estimate of the true probability given the grammar.</S>
<S sid="21" ssid="9">First, the top-down parsing algorithm builds a set of rooted candidate parse trees from left to right over the string, which allows it to calculate a generative probability for each prefix string from the probabilistic grammar, and hence a conditional probability for each word given the previous words and the probabilistic grammar.</S>
