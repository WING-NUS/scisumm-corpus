This paper talks about a Maximum-Entropy-Inspired Parser. The major technical innovation is the use of a "maximum-entropy-inspired" model for conditioning and smoothing that is to successfully to test and combine many different conditioning events. Here we present a new parser for parsing down to Penn tree-bank style parse trees that achieves 90.1~ average precision/recall for sentences of length < 40, and 89.5% for sentences of length < 100, when trained and tested on the previously established "standard" sections of the Wall Street Journal tree-bank. In our work we assume that any feature can occur at most once, so features are boolean-valued: 0 if the pattern does not occur, 1 if it does. The generative model assigns a probability to a parse by a top-down process of considering each constituent c in Ir and for each c first guessing the pre-terminal of c, t(c) (t for &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot;), then the lexical head of c, h(c), and then the expansion of c into further constituents e(c). Ultimately it is this flexibility that let us try the various conditioning events, to move on to a Markov grammar approach, and to try several Markov grammars of different orders, without significant programming. Indeed, we initiated this line of work in an attempt to create a parser that would be flexible enough to allow modifications for parsing down to more semantic levels of detail.
