This paper talks about an annotation scheme for free word order languages. The main key words annotated in this paper are tree bank, corpus, and free word order. It aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora ('tree banks') for stochastic grammar induction. The requirements for such formalism differ from those posited for configurational languages; several features have been added, influencing the architecture of the scheme. In order to avoid inconsistencies, the corpus is annotated in two stages: basic annotation and refinements. This paper focuses on annotating argument structure rather than constituent trees; it differs from existing tree banks in several aspects. These differences are illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme. Our annotation tool supplies efficient manipulation and immediate visualization of argument structures.
