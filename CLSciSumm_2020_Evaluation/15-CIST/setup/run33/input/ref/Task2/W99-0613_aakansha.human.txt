This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification.The task is to learn a function from an in- put string (proper name) to its type.The approach uses both spelling and contextual rules. A spelling rule might be a simple look-up for the string or a rule that looks at words within a string.They introduced a new algorithm for learning from unlabeled examples, which they called DL- Co'Train (DL stands for decision list, the term Cot r a i n is taken from (Blum and Mitchell 98)).It also presents a boosting-like framework that builds on ideas from (Blum and Mitchell 98). The method uses a "soft" measure of the agreement between two classifiers as an objective function;it describes an algorithm which directly optimizes this function.
