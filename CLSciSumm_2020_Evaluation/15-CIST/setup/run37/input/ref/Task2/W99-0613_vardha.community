This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification. AdaBoost finds a weighted combination of simple (weak) classifiers, where the weights are chosen to minimize a function that bounds the classification error on a set of training examples. This section describes an algorithm based on boosting algorithms, which were previously developed for supervised machine learning problems. We chose one of four labels for each example: location, person, organization, or noise where the noise category was used for items that were outside the three categories. Recent results (e.g., (Yarowsky 95; Brill 95; Blum and Mitchell 98)) have suggested that unlabeled data can be used quite profitably in reducing the need for supervision. (Riloff and Shepherd 97) describe a bootstrapping approach for acquiring nouns in particular categories (such as &amp;quot;vehicle&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;weapon&amp;quot; categories). The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster, Laird and Rubin 77) is a common approach for unsupervised training; in this section we describe its application to the named entity problem. (Blum and Mitchell 98) offer a promising formulation of redundancy, also prove some results about how the use of can help classification, and suggest an objective function when training with unlabeled examples. We present two algorithms. Many statistical or machine-learning approaches for natural language problems require a relatively large amount of supervision, in the form of labeled training examples. The algorithm can be viewed as heuristically optimizing an objective function suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98); empirically it is shown to be quite successful in optimizing this criterion. 971,746 sentences of New York Times text were parsed using the parser of (Collins 96).1 Word sequences that met the following criteria were then extracted as named entity examples: whose head is a singular noun (tagged NN). The DL-CoTrain algorithm can be motivated as being a greedy method of satisfying the above 2 constraints.
