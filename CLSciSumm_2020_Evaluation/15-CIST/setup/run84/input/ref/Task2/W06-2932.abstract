We present a two-stage multilingual dependency parser and evaluate it on 13 diverse languages. The first stage is based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006) augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages. The second stage takes the output from the first and labels all the edges in the dependency graph with appropriate syntactic categories using a globally trained sequence classifier over components of the graph. We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et al., 2006) data sets and present an error analysis.
