In this paper the author aims at three state-of-the-art statistical parsers which are combined to produce more accurate parses, as well as new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy. Two general approaches are presented and two combination techniques are described for each approach. The natural language processing community is in the strong position of having many available approaches to solve some of its most fundamental problems. Recently, combination techniques have been investigated for part of speech tagging with positive results. In both cases the investigators were able to achieve significant improvements over the previous best tagging results. Similar advances have been made in machine translation, speech recognition and named entity recognition. They have presented two general approaches to studying parser combination: parser switching and parse hybridization. Combining multiple highly-accurate independent parsers yields promising results. The author plans to explore more powerful techniques for exploiting the diversity of parsing methods.
