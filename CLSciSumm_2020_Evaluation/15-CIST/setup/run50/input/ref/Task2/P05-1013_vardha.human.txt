This paper talks about Pseudo-Projective Dependency Parsing. In order to realize the full potential of dependency-based syntactic parsing, it is desirable to allow non-projective dependency structures. The fact that projective dependency parsers can never exactly reproduce the analyses found in non-projective tree banks is often neglected because of the relative scarcity of problematic constructions. Here we show how non-projective dependency parsing can be achieved by combining a data driven projective parser with special graph transformation techniques. The overall parsing accuracy obtained with the pseudo-projective approach is still lower than for the best projective parsers. The main result is that the combined system can recover non-projective dependencies with a precision sufficient to give a significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy, especially with respect to the exact match criterion, leading to the best reported performance for robust non-projective parsing of Czech.
