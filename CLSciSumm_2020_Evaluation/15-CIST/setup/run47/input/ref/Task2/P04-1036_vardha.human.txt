This paper talks about Finding Predominant Word Senses in Untagged Text. We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the Word Net similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically. The first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised WSD systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account. We demonstrate that choosing texts from a particular domain has a significant influence on the sense ranking. A major benefit of our work, rather than reliance on hand-tagged training data such as SemCor, is that this method permits us to produce predominant senses for the domain and text type required. We have devised a method that uses raw corpus data to automatically find a predominant sense for nouns in Word Net. Whilst we have used Word Net as our sense inventory, it would be possible to use this method with another inventory given a measure of semantic relatedness between the neighbors and the senses.
