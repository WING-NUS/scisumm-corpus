In this paper the author aimed at reporting, adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser to information extraction and evaluate the new technique on MUC-7 template elements and template relations. The author is able to integrate both syntactic and semantic information into the parsing process, thus avoiding potential errors of syntax first followed by semantics. Their parsing algorithm, trained on the UPenn TREEBANK, was run on the New York Times source to create unsupervised syntactic training which was constrained to be consistent with semantic annotation. They were able to specify relatively simple guidelines that students with no training in computational linguistics could annotate. The semantic training corpus was produced by students according to a simple set of guidelines. This simple semantic annotation was the only source of task knowledge used to configure the model.
