In this paper, Henderson and Brill combined three state-of-the-art statistical parsers to produce more accurate parses, as well as new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy. The two general approaches presented to studying parser combination were parser switching and parse hybridization and two combination techniques were described for each approach. Both parametric and non-parametric techniques were given for each experiment. All four of the techniques studied resulted in parsing systems that performed better than any previously reported. Both of the switching techniques and the parametric hybridization technique were also shown to be robust when a poor parser was introduced into the experiment. Through parser combination, they reduced the precision error rate by 30% and the recall error rate by 6% compared to the best previously published performance results for the Penn Treebank.
