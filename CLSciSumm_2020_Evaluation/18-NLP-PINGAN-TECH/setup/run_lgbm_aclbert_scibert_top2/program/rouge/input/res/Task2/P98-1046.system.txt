We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÃÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts. We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses. However, there are some interesting differences in which sense extensions are allowed. We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÃÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts. These subclasses correspond very well to the English subclasses created by the intersective class. Current approaches to English classificaÃÂ­ tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limitaÃÂ­ tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes. Most of these verbs take the same alternations as in English and, by virtue of these alternations, achieve the same regular sense extensions. We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, interÃÂ­ sective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts. We will be using reÃÂ­ sources such as dictionaries and online corpora to investigate potential additional members of our classes. Although the Levin classes that make up an intersective class may have conflicting alternaÃÂ­ tions {e.g., verbs of exerting force can take the conative alternation, while carry verbs cannot), this does not invalidate the semantic regularity of the intersective class. This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes)
