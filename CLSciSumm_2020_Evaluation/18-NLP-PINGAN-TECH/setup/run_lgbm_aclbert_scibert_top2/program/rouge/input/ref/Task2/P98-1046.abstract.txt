Investigating regular sense extensions based on intersective Levin classes In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. We see verb classes as the key to making gen­ eralizations about regular extensions of mean­ ing. Current approaches to English classifica­ tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limita­ tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes. We present a refinement of Levin classes, intersec­ tive sets, which are a more fine-grained clas­ sification and have more coherent sets of syn­ tactic frames and associated semantic compo­ nents. We have preliminary indications that the membership of our intersective sets will be more compatible with WordNet than the orig­ inal Levin classes. We also have begun to ex­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties.
