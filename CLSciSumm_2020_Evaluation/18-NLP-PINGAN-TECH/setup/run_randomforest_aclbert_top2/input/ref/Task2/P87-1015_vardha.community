<S sid="165" ssid="50">This class of formalisms have the properties that their derivation trees are local sets, and manipulate objects, using a finite number of composition operations that use a finite number of symbols.</S>
 <S sid="119" ssid="4">In defining LCFRS's, we hope to generalize the definition of CFG's to formalisms manipulating any structure, e.g. strings, trees, or graphs.</S>
    <S sid="3" ssid="1">Much of the study of grammatical systems in computational linguistics has been focused on the weak generative capacity of grammatical formalism.</S>
    <S sid="118" ssid="3">In the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS's) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows.</S>
    <S sid="133" ssid="18">To show that the derivation trees of any grammar in LCFRS is a local set, we can rewrite the annotated derivation trees such that every node is labelled by a pair to include the composition operations.</S>
 <S sid="138" ssid="23">We can show that languages generated by LCFRS's are semilinear as long as the composition operation does not remove any terminal symbols from its arguments.</S>
    <S sid="156" ssid="41">Giving a recognition algorithm for LCFRL's involves describing the substrings of the input that are spanned by the structures derived by the LCFRS's and how the composition operation combines these substrings.</S>

 <S sid="164" ssid="49">Although embedding this version of LCFRS's in the framework of ILFP developed by Rounds (1985) is straightforward, our motivation was to capture properties shared by a family of grammatical systems and generalize them defining a class of related formalisms.</S>
 <S sid="204" ssid="10">The similarities become apparent when they are studied at the level of derivation structures: derivation nee sets of CFG's, HG's, TAG's, and MCTAG's are all local sets.</S>
    <S sid="9" ssid="7">We examine both the complexity of the paths of trees in the tree sets, and the kinds of dependencies that the formalisms can impose between paths.</S>
    <S sid="28" ssid="13">A TAG consists of a finite set of elementary trees that are either initial trees or auxiliary trees.</S>
