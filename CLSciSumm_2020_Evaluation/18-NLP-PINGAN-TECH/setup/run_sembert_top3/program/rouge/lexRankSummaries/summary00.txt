Last week, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and make the prince president of the National Assembly. Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence in Beijing. Sam Rainsy, a virulent critic of Hun Sen, and his party's 14 other members of parliament have remained outside Cambodia since September amid fears for their security. King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's top two political parties previously bitter rivals to form a coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen. After a meeting between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international community may be asked for security guarantees.
