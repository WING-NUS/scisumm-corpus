Two apparently opposing DOP models
exist in the literature: one which computes
the parse tree involving the most frequent
subtrees from a treebank and one which
computes the parse tree involving the
fewest subtrees from a treebank. This
paper proposes an integration of the two
models which outperforms each of them
separately. Together with a PCFGreduction
of DOP we obtain improved
accuracy and efficiency on the Wall Street
Journal treebank Our results show an 11%
relative reduction in error rate over
previous models, and an average
processing time of 3.6 seconds per WSJ
sentence.
