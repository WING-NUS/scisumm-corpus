Syria claims the ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria. But as neighbors, countries in the region must learn to get along, Reppas stressed. Turkey accuses Syria of harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast; it says rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan lives in Damascus. Turkish troops have reportedly massed on the frontier with Syria, while Ankara has indicated its readiness for cross-border raids to eradicate what it claims are guerrilla bases harboring Kurdish rebels. Milliyet daily speculated Sunday that Turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley of Lebanon, where Turkey says the rebels have bases. Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin denied any troop movement along the border, but said Turkey's patience was running out. Damascus denies that it is supporting the rebels, who wage cross-border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria. As we live in this region of the world ... we have to strive for good friendly relations and cooperation.
