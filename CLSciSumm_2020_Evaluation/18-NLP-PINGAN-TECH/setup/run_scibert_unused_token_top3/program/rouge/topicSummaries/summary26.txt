To announce the results of an extradition trial that has not yet even begun does not go hand in hand with justice, Cem told reporters before departing. Ocalan is being tried in absentia there on charges that could bring the death penalty. The move was also supported by a number of parliamentary deputies from the governing Socialist party. Europe has a tradition of civilization and human rights and I think as a rule it abides by that tradition. He noted that Italian law prohibits extradition of suspects to countries that have the death penalty. Kurds arrived from Germany and France to show solidarity with the rebel leader and a Kurdish group stopped at Rome's airport launched a hunger strike. The border crackdown appeared designed to prevent large numbers of Kurds living in Western Europe from flocking to Rome for protests in connection with Ocalan's arrest. About 1,500 Kurds who spent the night outside a military hospital where Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed held continued their hunger strike Monday to protest his detention. He had been seeking political asylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout in Syria.
