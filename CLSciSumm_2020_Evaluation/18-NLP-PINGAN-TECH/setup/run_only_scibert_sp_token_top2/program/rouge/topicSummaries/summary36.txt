Russian security officers in masks and camouflage stood over him protectively, then dragged him away as gunfire erupted and bullets bounced off the van. Chechen police were searching Wednesday for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them. British officials said they had not received any ransom demand for the missing men. One of four foreigners beheaded by kidnappers in Chechnya claimed in a videotape shown today that he and his fellow hostages were British spies. He said the company had opened a dialogue with the kidnappers and received confirmation that the hostages were alive as recently as last week. But its possession of the tape was likely to increase suspicions of a government link in the frequent kidnappings in Chechnya since it won de facto independence from Russia in a 1994-96 war. We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible crime, said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and order in Chechnya since being elected last year. Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for the past two months.
