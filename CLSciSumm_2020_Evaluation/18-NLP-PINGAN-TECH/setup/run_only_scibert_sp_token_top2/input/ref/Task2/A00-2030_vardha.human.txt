This paper talks about A Novel Use of Statistical Parsing to Extract Information from Text. We report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser to information extraction and evaluate this new technique on MUC-7 template elements and template relations. Our integrated model represents syntax and semantics jointly using augmented parse trees. In these trees, the standard TREEBANK structures are augmented to convey semantic information, that is, entities and relations. We describe the algorithm that was used to automatically produce augmented trees, starting with a) human-generated semantic annotations and b) machine generated syntactic parse trees. We were able to use the Penn TREEBANK to estimate the syntactic parameters; no additional syntactic training was required. The semantic training corpus was produced by students according to a simple set of guidelines. This simple semantic annotation was the only source of task knowledge used to configure the model.
