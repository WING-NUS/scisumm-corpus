    <S sid="15" ssid="8">Whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as SemCor is clearly useful, there is a strong case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a WSD system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.</S>
<S sid="45" ssid="1">In order to find the predominant sense of a target word we use a thesaurus acquired from automatically parsed text based on the method of Lin (1998).</S>
<S sid="66" ssid="22">It uses the glosses of semantically related (according to WordNet) senses too. jcn (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) This score uses corpus data to populate classes (synsets) in the WordNet hierarchy with frequency counts.</S>
 <S sid="126" ssid="3">We demonstrate that choosing texts from a particular domain has a significant influence on the sense ranking.</S>
<S sid="101" ssid="30">Thus, if we used the sense ranking as a heuristic for an &#8220;all nouns&#8221; task we would expect to get precision in the region of 60%.</S>
 <S sid="115" ssid="13">Our automatically acquired predominant sense performs nearly as well as the first sense provided by SemCor, which is very encouraging given that our method only uses raw text, with no manual labelling.</S>
  <S sid="89" ssid="18">Since both measures gave comparable results we restricted our remaining experiments to jcn because this gave good results for finding the predominant sense, and is much more efficient than lesk, given the precompilation of the IC files.</S>
 <S sid="137" ssid="14">Additionally, we evaluated our method quantitatively using the Subject Field Codes (SFC) resource (Magnini and Cavagli`a, 2000) which annotates WordNet synsets with domain labels.</S>
75 ssid="4">We generated a thesaurus entry for all polysemous nouns which occurred in SemCor with a frequency 2, and in the BNC with a frequency 10 in the grammatical relations listed in section 2.1 above.</S>
 <S sid="155" ssid="3">A major benefit of our work, rather than reliance on hand-tagged training data such as SemCor, is that this method permits us to produce predominant senses for the domain and text type required.</S>
  <S sid="8" ssid="1">The first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised WSD systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account.</S>
<S sid="68" ssid="24">We are of course able to apply the method to other versions of WordNet. synset, is incremented with the frequency counts from the corpus of all words belonging to that synset, directly or via the hyponymy relation.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="6">The high performance of the first sense baseline is due to the skewed frequency distribution of word senses.</S>
