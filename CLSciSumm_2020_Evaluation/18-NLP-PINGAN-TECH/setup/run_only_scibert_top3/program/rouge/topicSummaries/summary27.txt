LaLoggia reckons that the odds of picking takeover winners increase if an investor focuses on companies already partially owned by another. Driving the resurgence in mergers is a roaring stock market, the recognition by major corporations that it is getting harder to increase revenues internally and growing confidence among market players that the economy will not plunge into a recession next year. There is really no precedent for having as many big players as we have in the oil business in this modern society. Experts agreed that the regulators are most likely to permit Exxon and Mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production businesses because those areas are already highly competitive and a merger would not result in higher prices. I think we are going to see low oil prices for six months to a year. Oil exploration and drilling interests would not necessarily present antitrust problems in an Exxon-Mobil merger because competition in those areas is brisk. During that period, we are going to see a substantial reduction in investment in exploration and production, leading to a reduction in supply coming out of non-OPEC countries.
