<S sid="80" ssid="32">DOP1 has a serious bias: its subtree estimator provides more probability to nodes with more subtrees (Bonnema et al. 1999).</S>
S sid="143" ssid="8">While SL-DOP and LS-DOP have been compared before in Bod (2002), especially in the context of musical parsing, this paper presents the The DOP approach is based on two distinctive features: (1) the use of corpus fragments rather than grammar rules, and (2) the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones.</S>
<S sid="146" ssid="11">This paper also re-affirmed that the coarsegrained approach of using all subtrees from a treebank outperforms the fine-grained approach of specifically modeling lexical-syntactic depen dencies (as e.g. in Collins 1999 and Charniak 2000).</S>

<S sid="100" ssid="3">In Bod (2000b), an alternative notion for the best parse tree was proposed based on a simplicity criterion: instead of producing the most probable tree, this model produced the tree generated by the shortest derivation with the fewest training subtrees.</S>
    <S sid="30" ssid="27">Bod (2000a) solved this problem by training the subtree probabilities by a maximum likelihood procedure based on Expectation-Maximization.</S>
