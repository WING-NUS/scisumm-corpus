Collins and Singer, in this paper, discussed the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification. They showed that the use of data could reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple rules. The approach gained leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context in which it appeared were sufficient to determine its type. They presented two algorithms. The first method used a similar algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated by (Blum and Mitchell 98). The second algorithm extended ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98) and boosted the objective functions.
