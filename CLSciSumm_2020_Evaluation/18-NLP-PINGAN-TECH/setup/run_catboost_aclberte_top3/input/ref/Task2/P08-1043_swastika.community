    <S sid="94" ssid="26">Our use of an unweighted lattice reflects our belief that all the segmentations of the given input sentence are a-priori equally likely; the only reason to prefer one segmentation over the another is due to the overall syntactic context which is modeled via the PCFG derivations.</S>
<S sid="4" ssid="4">Using a treebank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling technique our model outperforms previous pipelined, integrated or factorized systems for Hebrew morphological and syntactic processing, yielding an error reduction of 12% over the best published results so far.</S>
    <S sid="19" ssid="15">Here we push the single-framework conjecture across the board and present a single model that performs morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation in a fully generative framework.</S>
S sid="105" ssid="37">3An English sentence with ambiguous PoS assignment can be trivially represented as a lattice similar to our own, where every pair of consecutive nodes correspond to a word, and every possible PoS assignment for this word is a connecting arc.</S>
<S sid="163" ssid="1">The accuracy results for segmentation, tagging and parsing using our different models and our standard data split are summarized in Table 1.</S>
    <S sid="100" ssid="32">This means that the rules in our grammar are of two kinds: (a) syntactic rules relating nonterminals to a sequence of non-terminals and/or PoS tags, and (b) lexical rules relating PoS tags to lattice arcs (lexemes).</S>
<S sid="188" ssid="2">The overall performance of our joint framework demonstrates that a probability distribution obtained over mere syntactic contexts using a Treebank grammar and a data-driven lexicon outperforms upper bounds proposed by previous joint disambiguation systems and achieves segmentation and parsing results on a par with state-of-the-art standalone applications results.</S>
<S sid="86" ssid="18">A morphological analyzer M : W&#8212;* L is a function mapping sentences in Hebrew (W E W) to their corresponding lattices (M(W) = L E L).</S>
<S sid="97" ssid="29">Thus our proposed model is a proper model assigning probability mass to all (7r, L) pairs, where 7r is a parse tree and L is the one and only lattice that a sequence of characters (and spaces) W over our alpha-beth gives rise to.</S>
