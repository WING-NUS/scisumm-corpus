<S sid="168" ssid="10">We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation.</S>
<S sid="165" ssid="7">In addition the approach provides empirical material for psycholinguistic investigation, since preferences for the choice of certain syntactic constructions, linea.rizations, and attachments that have been observed in online experiments of language production and comprehension can now be put in relation with the frequency of these alternatives in larger amounts of texts.</S>
<S sid="145" ssid="26">This amount of data suffices as training material to reliably assign the grammatical functions if the user determines the elements of a phrase and its type (step 1 of the list above).</S>
<S sid="15" ssid="5">Existing treebank annotation schemes exhibit a fairly uniform architecture, as they all have to meet the same basic requirements, namely: Descriptivity: Grammatical phenomena are to be described rather than explained.<
<S sid="41" ssid="31">Apart from this rather technical problem, two further arguments speak against phrase structure as the structural pivot of the annotation scheme: Finally, the structural handling of free word order means stating well-formedness constraints on structures involving many trace-filler dependencies, which has proved tedious.</S>
<S sid="47" ssid="37">Argument structure can be represented in terms of unordered trees (with crossing branches).</S>
<S sid="167" ssid="9">In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created.</S>

<S sid="39" ssid="29">Consider the German sentence (1) daran wird ihn Anna erkennen, &amp;di er weint at-it will him Anna recognise that he cries 'Anna will recognise him at his cry' A sample constituent structure is given below: The fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies, marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes.</S>
<S sid="160" ssid="2">These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme.</S>
<S sid="166" ssid="8">Syntactically annotated corpora of German have been missing until now.</S>
<S sid="143" ssid="24">Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing.</S>
  <S sid="71" ssid="16">However, there is a trade-off between the granularity of information encoded in the labels and the speed and accuracy of annotation.</S>

<S sid="151" ssid="32">For evaluation, the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets, one for training (90% of the corpus), the other one for testing (10%).</S>
