The authors in this paper describe a search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP). From a DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem, they present a novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an e√Ücient search algorithm. A beam search concept is applied as in speech recognition. There is no global pruning. An extended lexicon model is defined, and its likelihood is compared to a baseline lexicon model, which takes only single-word dependencies into account. In order to handle the necessary word reordering as an optimization problem within the dynamic programming approach, they describe a solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) which is based on dynamic programming. The approach assumes that the word reordering is restricted to a few positions in the source sentence. The approach has been successfully tested on the 8 000-word Verbmobil task. The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task which is a limited-domain spoken-language task.
