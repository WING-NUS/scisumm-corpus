If it gets really bad, we'll go to the church and see what the architect of the world has in store for us. At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday. National police spokesman Ivan Mejia said the Coco, Segovia and Cruta rivers all overflowed their banks Monday along Honduras eastern coast. In El Progreso, 100 miles( 160 kilometers) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, the army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident. The United States committed 19 Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters, two C-27 aircraft and one C-130 cargo plane. A total of 14 helicopter relief missions were delivering aid to stricken towns, said Col. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton added Nicaragua and Honduras to a trip she plans to the region beginning Nov.
