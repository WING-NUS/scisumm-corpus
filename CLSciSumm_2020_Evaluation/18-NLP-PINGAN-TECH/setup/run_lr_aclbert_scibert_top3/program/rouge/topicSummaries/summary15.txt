The bank has gone to extraordinary lengths in recent months to differentiate its role from that of the fund, and to announce a tripling of aid to the poorest in the countries hit by the economic chaos. Among the biggest deadbeats are the power ministries the military and interior departments which did not pay during Soviet times and feel little need to pay now. After two weeks of deliberations he announced that he still had no plan to rescue the country from its economic crisis. Not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan calls for a greater state role in the economy, including controls on hard currency. Privatization will be accomplished for growth of production, growth of investment and growth of production effectiveness through renewal of major funds, Primakov said during a meeting of Western businessmen. It is unclear how long Primakov can carry on without spelling out a detailed strategy. The plan also has many similarities with the plan presented to the government by Gorbachev-era advisers. Such concerns have turned this year's meeting into a tumbled mass of worries and a groping for short and long-term solutions.
