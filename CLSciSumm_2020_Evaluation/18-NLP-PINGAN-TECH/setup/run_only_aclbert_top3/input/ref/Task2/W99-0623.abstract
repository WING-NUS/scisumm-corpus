Three state-of-the-art statistical parsers are combined
to produce more accurate parses, as well as
new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy.
Two general approaches are presented and two
combination techniques are described for each approach.
Both parametric and non-parametric models
are explored, i The resulting parsers surpass the
best previously published performance results for
the Penn Treebank.
