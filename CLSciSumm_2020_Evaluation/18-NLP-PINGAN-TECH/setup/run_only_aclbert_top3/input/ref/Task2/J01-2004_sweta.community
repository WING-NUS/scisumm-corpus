<S sid="372" ssid="128">The small size of our training data, as well as the fact that we are rescoring n-best lists, rather than working directly on lattices, makes comparison with the other models not particularly informative.</S>
"<S sid=""40"" ssid=""28"">The following section will provide some background in probabilistic context-free grammars and language modeling for speech recognition.</S>
    <S sid=""41"" ssid=""29"">There will also be a brief review of previous work using syntactic information for language modeling, before we introduce our model in Section 4.</S>
    <S sid=""42"" ssid=""30"">Three parse trees: (a) a complete parse tree; (b) a complete parse tree with an explicit stop symbol; and (c) a partial parse tree.</S>"
<S sid="25" ssid="13">A parser that is not left to right, but which has rooted derivations, e.g., a headfirst parser, will be able to calculate generative joint probabilities for entire strings; however, it will not be able to calculate probabilities for each word conditioned on previously generated words, unless each derivation generates the words in the string in exactly the same order.</S>
<S sid="364" ssid="120">We follow Chelba (2000) in dealing with this problem: for parsing purposes, we use the Penn Treebank tokenization; for interpolation with the provided trigram model, and for evaluation, the lattice tokenization is used.</S>
<S sid="302" ssid="58">In the beam search approach outlined above, we can estimate the string's probability in the same manner, by summing the probabilities of the parses that the algorithm finds.</S>
 <S sid="31" ssid="19">Thus, our top-down parser allows for the incremental calculation of generative conditional word probabilities, a property it shares with other left-to-right parsers with rooted derivations such as Earley parsers (Earley 1970) or left-corner parsers (Rosenkrantz and Lewis 11 1970).</S>
<S sid="231" ssid="135">Since we do not know the POS for the word, we must sum the LAP for all POS For a PCFG G, a stack S = Ao An$ (which we will write AN and a look-ahead terminal item wi, we define the look-ahead probability as follows: We recursively estimate this with two empirically observed conditional probabilities for every nonterminal A,: 13(A, w,a) and P(A, c).</S>
<S sid="297" ssid="53">The differences between a k-best and a beam-search parser (not to mention the use of dynamic programming) make a running time difference unsurprising.</S>
<S sid="133" ssid="37">Statistically based heuristic best-first or beam-search strategies (Caraballo and Charniak 1998; Charniak, Goldwater, and Johnson 1998; Goodman 1997) have yielded an enormous improvement in the quality and speed of parsers, even without any guarantee that the parse returned is, in fact, that with the maximum likelihood for the probability model.</S>
<S sid="291" ssid="47">Also, the parser returns a set of candidate parses, from which we have been choosing the top ranked; if we use an oracle to choose the parse with the highest accuracy from among the candidates (which averaged 70.0 in number per sentence), we find an average labeled precision/recall of 94.1, for sentences of length &lt; 100.</S>
<S sid="355" ssid="111">In order to get a sense of whether these perplexity reduction results can translate to improvement in a speech recognition task, we performed a very small preliminary experiment on n-best lists.</S>
<S sid="59" ssid="17">A PCFG is a CFG with a probability assigned to each rule; specifically, each righthand side has a probability given the left-hand side of the rule.</S>
<S sid="100" ssid="4">The approach that we will subsequently present uses the probabilistic grammar as its language model, but only includes probability mass from those parses that are found, that is, it uses the parser to find a subset of the total set of parses (hopefully most of the high-probability parses) and uses the sum of their probabilities as an estimate of the true probability given the grammar.</S>
NA
<S sid="108" ssid="12">Another approach that uses syntactic structure for language modeling has been to use a shift-reduce parser to &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; c-commanding phrasal headwords or part-of-speech (POS) tags from arbitrarily far back in the prefix string, for use in a trigram-like model.</S>
<S sid="31" ssid="19">Thus, our top-down parser allows for the incremental calculation of generative conditional word probabilities, a property it shares with other left-to-right parsers with rooted derivations such as Earley parsers (Earley 1970) or left-corner parsers (Rosenkrantz and Lewis 11 1970).</S>
