Morphological processes in Semitic languages
deliver space-delimited words which introduce
multiple, distinct, syntactic units into the
structure of the input sentence. These words
are in turn highly ambiguous, breaking the
assumption underlying most parsers that the
yield of a tree for a given sentence is known in
advance. Here we propose a single joint model
for performing both morphological segmentation
and syntactic disambiguation which bypasses
the associated circularity. Using a treebank
grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a
linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling
technique our model outperforms previous
pipelined, integrated or factorized systems
for Hebrew morphological and syntactic processing,
yielding an error reduction of 12%
over the best published results so far.
