The talks featured what the players association implied were a bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would accommodate the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owners. The main sticking point has been the owners insistence on a salary cap without exceptions, the implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries in line with revenue growth. The most important loophole in its salary cap lets a team sign its own free agent for whatever it is willing to pay. Owners would like to implement a restrictive salary cap that would eventually put a ceiling on how much one player can earn. In support of its arguments, the union pointed to clauses in a few individual player contracts that contained language precluding payment during a lockout. Neither side is predicting progress toward signing a new collective bargaining agreement and beginning the season as scheduled on Nov. But if the players lose the arbitration, more than 400 athletes many with extravagant lifestyles and tremendous financial obligations will have their allegiances instantly tested.
