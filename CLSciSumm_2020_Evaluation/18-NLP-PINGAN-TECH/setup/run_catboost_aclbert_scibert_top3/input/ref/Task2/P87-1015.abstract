We consider the structural descriptions produced by various
grammatical formalisms in ~ of the complexity of the
paths and the relationship between paths in the sets of structural
descriptions that each system can generate. In considering the
relationship between formalisms, we show that it is useful to
abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine
the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties
of their deriva:ion trees. We find that several of the formalisms
considered can be seen as being closely related since they have
derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced
by Context-Free C-ramma~. On the basis of this observation,
we describe a class of formalisms which we call Linear Context-
Free Rewriting Systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial
time and generate only semilinear languages.
