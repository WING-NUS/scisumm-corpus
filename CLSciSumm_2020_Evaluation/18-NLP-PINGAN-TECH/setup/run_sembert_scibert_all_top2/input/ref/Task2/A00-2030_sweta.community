<S sid="18" ssid="1">Almost all approaches to information extraction &#8212; even at the sentence level &#8212; are based on the divide-and-conquer strategy of reducing a complex problem to a set of simpler ones.</S>
<S sid="100" ssid="5">Given multiple constituents that cover identical spans in the chart, only those constituents with probabilities within a While our focus throughout the project was on TE and TR, we became curious about how well the model did at part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and at name finding.</S>
<S sid="52" ssid="1">In this section, we describe the algorithm that was used to automatically produce augmented trees, starting with a) human-generated semantic annotations and b) machinegenerated syntactic parse trees.</S>
<S sid="34" ssid="2">In these trees, the standard TREEBANK structures are augmented to convey semantic information, that is, entities and relations.</S>
<S sid="1" ssid="1">Since 1995, a few statistical parsing algorithms have demonstrated a breakthrough in parsing accuracy, as measured against the UPenn TREEBANK as a gold standard.</S>
<S sid="61" ssid="2">The detailed probability structure differs, however, in that it was designed to jointly perform part-of-speech tagging, name finding, syntactic parsing, and relation finding in a single process.</S
<S sid="104" ssid="1">We have demonstrated, at least for one problem, that a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFGHR) can be used effectively for information extraction.</S>
<S sid="32" ssid="15">Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages, we were optimistic that some of their properties &#8212; especially their ability to learn from large amounts of data, and their robustness when presented with unexpected inputs &#8212; would also benefit semantic analysis.</S>
