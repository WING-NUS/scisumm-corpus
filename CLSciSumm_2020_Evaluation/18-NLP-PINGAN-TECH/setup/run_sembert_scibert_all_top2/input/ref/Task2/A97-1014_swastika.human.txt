In this paper, Skut et all described an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages. The annotation scheme described in this paper focused on annotating argument structure rather than constituent trees. It differed from existing treebanks in several aspects which could be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme. They argued that their selected approach was better suited for producing high quality interpreted corpora in languages exhibiting free constituent order and provided empirical material for psycholinguistic investigation, since preferences for the choice of certain syntactic constructions, linearizations etc. Their annotation tool supplied efficient manipulation and immediate visualization of argument structures. Partial automation included in the current version significantly reduced the manna.1 effort. Its extension was subject to further investigations according to them.
