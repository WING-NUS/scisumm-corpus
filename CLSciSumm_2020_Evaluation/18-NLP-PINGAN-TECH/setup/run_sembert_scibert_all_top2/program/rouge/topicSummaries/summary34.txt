Israel froze implementation of the accord altogether, accusing Arafat of violating the deal and inciting violent street protests. Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what he claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace accord. The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing excuse after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces a very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down the government in the event of another troop withdrawal. Demonstrators threw stones at Israeli troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The Israeli leader is fighting for his political survival as parliament prepares for a no-confidence vote within two weeks. I hope God will enable me to use my grief to strengthen my determination for peace. And three days before that, Israelis were horrified by television footage of an Israeli soldier being dragged from a car and beaten with chunks of concrete by a Palestinian mob.
