The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is a significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words. Supersense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organise their manual insertion into WORDNET. Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction and class-based smoothing, to text classification and question answering. Some specialist topics are better covered in WORDNET than others. A considerable amount of research addresses structurally and statistically manipulating the hierarchy of WORDNET and the construction of new wordnet using the concept structure from English. Ciaramita and Johnson  implement a supersense tagger based on the multi-class preceptor classifier, which uses the standard collocation, spelling and syntactic features common in WSD and named entity recognition systems. The authors demonstrate the use of a very efficient shallow NLP pipeline to process a massive corpus. Such a corpus is needed to acquire reliable contextual information for the often very rare nouns they are attempting to supersense tag.
