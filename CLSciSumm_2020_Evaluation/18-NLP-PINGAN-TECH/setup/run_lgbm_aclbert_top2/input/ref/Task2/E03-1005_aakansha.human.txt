Rens Bod in his paper 'An Efficient Implementation of a New DOP Model' presents a DOP approach which is based on two distinctive features:first,the use of corpus fragments rather than grammar rules, and second,the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones.Together with a PCFG-reduction of DOP he obtains improved accuracy and efficiency on the Wall Street Journal treebank.The results show an 11%
relative reduction in error rate over previous models, and an average processing time of 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence.The highest accuracy is obtained by SL-DOP(Simplicity-DOP) at 12 smaller than or equal to n smaller than or equal to 14: an LP(Label precision) of 90.8% and an LR(Label Recall) of 90.7%.The accuracy of SL-DOP decreases after n=14 and converges to Simplicity-DOP but the accuracy of LS-DOP continues to increase and converges to Likelihood-DOP.
