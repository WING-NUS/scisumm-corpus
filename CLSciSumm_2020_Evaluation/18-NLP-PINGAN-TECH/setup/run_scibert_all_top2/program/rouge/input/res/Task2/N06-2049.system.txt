In this section we introduce a confidence measure approach to combine the two results. Comparing Table 1 and 2, we found the CRF-modeled IOB tagging yielded better segmentation than the dictionary- based approach. In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation. In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation. We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections. We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation. We will give a detailed description of this approach in Section 2. In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation. It is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging. We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach. We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation. Comparing Table 1 and 2, we found the CRF-modeled IOB tagging yielded better segmentation than the dictionary- based
