The organizing committee certainly has people of integrity and ethical standards that would stand any investigation. But he sought to distance himself from the allegations by making a distinction between the actions of the bidding committee and the current organizing committee. In the event of a serious breach of the present regulations, the IOC executive board may further propose to the IOC session that it exclude the city having breached the regulation from the contest for the games.
 Olympic rules prohibit bidding cities from giving IOC members or their relatives any presents or benefits exceeding a value of dlrs 150. He said he was told not to appear at a scheduled routine news conference. Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning the bid something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon. Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former bid chief Thomas Welch. He said, If necessary we will expel members if this ad hoc commission thinks these members are guilty.
