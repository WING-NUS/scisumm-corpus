From our perspective, perhaps the two most important numbers to come out of this research are the overall error reduction of 13% over the results in [9] and the intermediateresult improvement of nearly 2% on labeled precision/recall due to the simple idea of guessing the head's pre-terminal before guessing the head.
The first is the slight, but important, improvement achieved by using this model over conventional deleted interpolation, as indicated in Figure 2.
