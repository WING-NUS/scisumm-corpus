The approach works as follows: it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the reÃÂ­ maining candidates (see next section). It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as "antecedent indicators"). Our work is a continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaphÃÂ­ ora resolution. For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell & Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria & Stallard 1989; Lappin & McCord 1990; Lappin & Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich & LuperFoy 1988; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979). Several proposals have already addressed the anaphora resolution problem by deliberately limiting the extent to which they rely on domain and/or linÃÂ­ guistic knowledge (Baldwin 1997; Dagan & ltai 1990; Kennedy & Boguraev 1996; Mitkov 1998; Nasukawa 1994; Williams et al. 1996). We have described a robust, knowledge-poor apÃÂ­ proach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger. The algorithm for pronoun resolution can be deÃÂ­ scribed informally as follows: 1. This paper presÃÂ­ ents a robust, knowledge-poor approach to resolving pronouns in technical
