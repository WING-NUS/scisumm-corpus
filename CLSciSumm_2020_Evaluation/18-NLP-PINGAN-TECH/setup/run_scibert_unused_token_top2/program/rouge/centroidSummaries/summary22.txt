An aide, Raanan Gisin, said Sharon accepted the position so that he could stem the tide of dangerous developments and contribute to fighting the risks facing Israel. He has called for burning Beirut, annexing the Golan, occupying the( West) Bank and slaughtering and displacing the Arabs everywhere.
 I think it's a clear-cut message from Bibi, Saeb Erekat, a lead negotiator for the Palestinians, said, using Netanyahu's nickname. An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps.

I do know one thing that when you are dependent on the vote of one or two people you can never know what will be. Many Israelis, even those who despise his politics, see him as a strong, experienced figure who knows his mind and who is capable of being moderate when he has power.
