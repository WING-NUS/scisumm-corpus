Dipanjan Das and Slav Petrov in their paper 'Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging with Bilingual Graph-Based Projections' propose a new approach for developing unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language.They use a novel graph-based framework for projecting syntactic information across language boundaries.They construct a bilingual graph
over word types to establish a connection between the two languages, and then use graph label propagation to project syntactic information from
English to the foreign language. They treat the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model, rather than using them directly for supervised training. To make the projection practical,they used the twelve universal part-of-speech tags.The focus of this work is on building POS taggers for foreign languages, including an English POS tagger and some parallel text between the two languages.Their results outperform strong unsupervised baselines as well as approaches that rely on direct projections, and bridge the gap between purely supervised and unsupervised
POS tagging models.
