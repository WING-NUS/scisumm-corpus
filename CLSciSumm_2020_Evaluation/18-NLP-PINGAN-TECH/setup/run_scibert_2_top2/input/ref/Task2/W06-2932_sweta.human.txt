In this paper the author aims at presenting a two-stage multilingual dependency parser and evaluates it on 13 diverse languages. With the availability of resources such as the Penn WSJ Treebank, much of the focus in the parsing community had been on producing syntactic representations based on phrase-structure. However, recently there has been a revived interest in parsing models that produce dependency graph representations of sentences, which model words and their arguments through directed edges. Dependency graphs also encode much of the deep syntactic information needed for further processing. In the future, the author plans to extend these models in two ways. First, they plan on examining the performance difference between two-staged dependency parsing and joint parsing plus labelling. Second, they plan on integrating any available morphological features in a more principled manner. The current system simply includes all morphological bi-gram features. It is the hope that a better morphological feature set will help with both unlabeled parsing and labelling for highly inflected languages.
