Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâ€™s query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâ€™s question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question. Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks. In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications. For each pair we also record the context, i.e. the phrase between the two NEs (Step1). Hereafter, each pair of NE categories will be called a domain; e.g. the “Company – Company” domain, which we will call CC- domain (Step 2). For each domain, phrases which contain the same keyword are gathered to build a set of phrases (Step 3). Extract NE instance pairs with contexts First, we extract NE pair instances with their context from the corpus. The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004]. These 140 NE categories are designed by extending MUC’s 7 NE categories with finer sub-categories (such as Company, Institute, and Political Party for Organization; and Country, Province, and City for Location) and adding some new types of NE categories (Position Title, Product, Event, and Natural Object). Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword. Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances. Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases. There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora. Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01]. While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system. We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.</S
