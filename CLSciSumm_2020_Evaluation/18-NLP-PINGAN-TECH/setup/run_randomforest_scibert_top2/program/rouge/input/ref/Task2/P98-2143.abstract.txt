Robust pronoun resolution with limited knowledge Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge. One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledge­ based system, however, is that it is a very labour­ intensive and time-consuming task. This paper pres­ ents a robust, knowledge-poor approach to resolving pronouns in technical manuals, which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger. Input is checked against agreement and for a number of antecedent indicators. Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent. Evaluation reports a success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data. In addition, preliminary experiments show that the approach can be success­ fully adapted for other languages with minimum modifications.
