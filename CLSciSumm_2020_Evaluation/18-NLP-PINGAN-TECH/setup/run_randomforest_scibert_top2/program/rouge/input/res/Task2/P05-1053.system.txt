In this paper, we only model explicit relations because of poor inter-annotator agreement in the annotation of implicit relations and their limited number. For each pair of mentions3, we compute various lexical, syntactic and semantic features. This feature concerns about the entity type of both the mentions, which can be PERSON, ORGANIZATION, FACILITY, LOCATION and GeoPolitical Entity or GPE: ÃḃÂáẁ ET12: combination of mention entity types 4.3 Mention Level. Tree kernel-based approaches proposed by Zelenko et al (2003) and Culotta et al (2004) are able to explore the implicit feature space without much feature engineering.

Tree kernel-based approaches proposed by Zelenko et al (2003) and Culotta et al (2004) are able to explore the implicit feature space without much feature engineering. It also shows that feature-based methods dramatically outperform kernel methods. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a supervised machine learning technique motivated by the statistical learning theory (Vapnik 1998). Moreover, we only apply the simple linear kernel, although other kernels can peform better. In this paper, we have presented a feature-based approach for relation extraction where diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge are employed.
