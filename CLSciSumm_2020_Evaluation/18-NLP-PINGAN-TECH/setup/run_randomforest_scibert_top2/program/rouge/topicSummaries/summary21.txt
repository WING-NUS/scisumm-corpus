Murad showed that a gas could regulate important cellular functions and studied how nitroglycerin and related heart drugs led to the release of nitric oxide. Inhalation of nitric oxide gas has saved the lives of some people with certain lung diseases, particularly infants who have developed dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. The award committee said that this was the first discovery that a gas can act as a signal molecule in the organism. His personal delight was seconded by a burst of public elation in his homeland. The Nobel citation praised his work that with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality. Bacteria can release products that cause white blood cells to release enormous amounts of nitric oxide.
