Tuesday, officials at Colorado State University reacted with outrage to the fraternity float, opening an investigation and disciplinary procedures against the fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha. On Sunday, the Laramie police said that McKinney had been arrested on Thursday at the same hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was being treated. Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's murder has elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected quarters. The young man completed high school at a boarding school in Lugano, Switzerland, where he learned Italian and German. I see his name going down in gay history as a catalyst for renewed activism, said Matt Foreman, a former Wyomingite who directs Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay political organization in New York. Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming and in the United States Congress as the need for this legislation. In Denver, mourners wrote messages on a graffiti wall as part of national Gay Awareness Week.
