Authors Nilsson and Nivre showed how a data-driven deterministic dependency parser, in itself restricted to projective structures, can be combined with graph transformation techniques to produce non-projective structures. Experiments using data from the Prague Dependency Treebank showed that the combined system can handle non-projective constructions with a precision sufficient to yield a significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy. The combined system could recover non-projective dependencies with a precision sufficient to give a significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy, especially with respect to the exact match criterion. This led to the best reported performance for robust non-projective parsing of Czech.
