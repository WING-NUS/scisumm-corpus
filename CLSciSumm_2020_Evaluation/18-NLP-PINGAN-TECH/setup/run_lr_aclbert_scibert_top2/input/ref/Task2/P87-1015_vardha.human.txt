This paper talks about characterizing structural descriptions produced by various grammatical formalisms. We consider the structural descriptions produced by various grammatical formalisms in terms of the complexity of the paths and the relationship between paths in the sets of structural descriptions that each system can generate. We consider properties of the tree sets generated by CFG's, Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG's), Head Grammars (HG's), Categorial Grammars (CG's), and IG's. In the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS's) may be defined and sketch how semi linearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows. In defining LCFRS's, we hope to generalize the definition of CFG's to formalisms manipulating any structure, e.g. strings, trees, or graphs. To show that the derivation trees of any grammar in LCFRS is a local set, we can rewrite the annotated derivation trees such that every node is labeled by a pair to include the composition operations. Our goal has been to use the notion of LCFRS's to classify grammatical systems on the basis of their strong generative capacity.
