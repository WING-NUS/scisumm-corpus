 In this paper, the authors mapped questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs. They introduced a new semantic representation which highlighted a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms. On two stansemantic parsing benchmarks our system obtains the highest published accuracies, despite requiring no annotated logical forms. They built a system that interpreted natural language borders which specified only that border can be used, but utterances much more accurately than existing not how. The combination rules are encoded in the systems, despite using no annotated logical forms. Their features were soft preferences. This yielded a more system is based on a new semantic representation, factorized and flexible representation that is easier DCS, which offered a simple and expressive alternative to lambda calculus search through and parametrize using features. Free from the burden, it also allowed them to easily add new lexical triggers of annotating logical forms.
