Yoav Goldberg and Reut Tsarfaty in their paper'A Single Generative Model for Joint Morphological Segmentation and Syntactic Parsing' propose a single model that performs morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation in a fully generative framework.The data was taken from the Hebrew Treebank.They employed PCFG and used BitPar, an efficient general purpose parser,together with various treebank grammars to parse the input sentences and propose compatible morphological segmentation and syntactic analysis and a data-driven morphological analyzer .Their model outperforms previous pipelined, integrated or factorized systems for Hebrew morphological and syntactic processing, yielding an error reduction of 12% over the best published results so far.
