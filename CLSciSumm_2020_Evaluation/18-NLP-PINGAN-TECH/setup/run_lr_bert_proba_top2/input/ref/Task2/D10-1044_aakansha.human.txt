'Discriminative Instance Weighting for Domain Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation' by George Foster, Cyril Goutte and Roland Kuhn study the problem of using a parallel corpus from a background domain (OUT) to improve performance on a target domain (IN) for which a smaller amount of parallel training material is availalable.They aim to explicitly characterize examples from OUT as belonging to general language or not and to apply instance weighting at the level of phrase pairs.Finally, they make some improvements to baseline approaches. they train linear mixture models for conditional phrase pair probabilities over IN and OUT so as to maximize the likelihood of an empirical joint phrase-pair distribution extracted from a development set.they used a very simple phrase-based system in two different adaptation settings:The first setting uses the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) corpus (Tiedemann, 2009) as IN, and the Europarl (EP) corpus as OUT,for English/French translation in both directions.The second setting uses the news-related sub-corpora for the NIST09 MT Chinese to English evaluation 8 as IN, and the remaining NIST parallel Chinese/English corpora (UN, Hong Kong Laws,and Hong Kong Hansard) as OUT.They obtained positive results from the approach.
