In order for a machine translation system to translate these new words correctly, its bilingual lexicon needs to be constantly updated with new word translations. Comparable corpora refer to texts that are not direct translation but are about the same topic. For example, various news agencies report major world events in different languages, and such news documents form a readily available source of comparable corpora. In this paper, we propose a new approach for the task of mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining both context and transliteration information. So we use the the context of c , we are likely to retrieve the context of e when we use the context of c as query C(c) to retrieve a document C (e* ) that * the query and try to retrieve the most similar best matches the query. We employ the language modeling approach (Ng, 2000; Ponte and Croft, 1998) for corresponding to that document translation of c . C (e* ) is the this retrieval problem. In our translation problem, C(c) is viewed as the query and C(e) is viewed as a document. We used a list of 1,580 ChineseEnglish name pairs as training data for the EM algorithm. Finally, the English candidate word with the smallest average rank position and that appears within the top M positions of both ranked lists is the chosen English translation (as described in Section 2). To investigate the effect of the two individual sources of information (context and transliteration), we checked how many translations could be found using only one source of information (i.e., context alone or transliteration alone), on those Chinese words that have translations in the English part of the comparable corpus.
