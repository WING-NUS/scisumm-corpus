In this paper, the authors' aim is to present a new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information. When translating a word w, two sources of information can be used to determine its translation: the word w itself and the surrounding words in the neighbourhood (i.e., the context) of w. They employ the language modelling approach for the retrieval problem. They attempted to improve named entity translation by combining phonetic and semantic information. The author evaluated the approach on six months of Chinese and English Gigaword corpora, with encouraging results.
