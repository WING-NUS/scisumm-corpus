 <S sid="108" ssid="1">The results of the manual and automatic evaluation of the participating system translations is detailed in the figures at the end of this paper.</S>
<S sid="34" ssid="27">For more on the participating systems, please refer to the respective system description in the proceedings of the workshop.</S>
<S sid="18" ssid="11">In addition to the Europarl test set, we also collected 29 editorials from the Project Syndicate website2, which are published in all the four languages of the shared task.</S>
 <S sid="151" ssid="44">The statistical systems seem to still lag behind the commercial rule-based competition when translating into morphological rich languages, as demonstrated by the results for English-German and English-French.</S>
<S sid="16" ssid="9">The test data was again drawn from a segment of the Europarl corpus from the fourth quarter of 2000, which is excluded from the training data.</S>
 <S sid="172" ssid="3">Due to many similarly performing systems, we are not able to draw strong conclusions on the question of correlation of manual and automatic evaluation metrics.</S>
 <S sid="36" ssid="2">The BLEU metric, as all currently proposed automatic metrics, is occasionally suspected to be biased towards statistical systems, especially the phrase-based systems currently in use.</S>
<S sid="103" ssid="19">Given a set of n sentences, we can compute the sample mean x&#65533; and sample variance s2 of the individual sentence judgements xi: The extend of the confidence interval [x&#8722;d, x+df can be computed by d = 1.96 &#183;&#65533;n (6) Pairwise Comparison: As for the automatic evaluation metric, we want to be able to rank different systems against each other, for which we need assessments of statistical significance on the differences between a pair of systems.</S>
<S sid="167" ssid="60">One annotator suggested that this was the case for as much as 10% of our test sentences.</S>
<S sid="102" ssid="18">Confidence Interval: To estimate confidence intervals for the average mean scores for the systems, we use standard significance testing.</S>
