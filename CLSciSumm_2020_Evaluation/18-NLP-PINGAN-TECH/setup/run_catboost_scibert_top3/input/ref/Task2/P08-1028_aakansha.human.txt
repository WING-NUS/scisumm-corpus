Jeff Mitchell and Mirella Lapata in their paper 'Vector-based Models of Semantic Composition' present models of semantic
composition that are empirically grounded and can represent similarity relations. They present a general framework for vector-based composition consider both additive and multiplicative models of vector combination and assess their performance on a sentence similarity rating experiment.They propose a framework to represent the meaning of the combination u+v as a function f operating on four components:p = f (u, v, R, K).R is the relation holding between u and v, and K additional knowledge. Their results show that the multiplicative models are superior to additive when compared to human judgement.The multiplicative model yields a better fit with the experimental data, ρ = 0.17. The combined model is best overall with ρ = 0.19. However,the difference between the two models is not statistically significant.In order to understand vector composition in deep more research in the area is required.
