Zarya is designed to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and communications. We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes, Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. The Mir competes with the international space station for very critical resources and for funding, Brinkley said. The plan called for the men to lug two suitcase-size antennas about halfway up Unity and install them on opposite sides of the 36-foot cylinder. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before been assigned to handle an object as massive as the 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakhstan on Nov. It will fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. Russian space experts were making final preparations Thursday at the Baikonur rocket base to launch the first component of a multibillion dollar international space station after a year of delay.
