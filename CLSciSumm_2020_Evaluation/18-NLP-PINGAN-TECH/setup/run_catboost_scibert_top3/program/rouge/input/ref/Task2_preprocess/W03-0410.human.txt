In this paper, the authors used a semi-supervised method for verb class discovery using Noisy Features. The feature set was previously shown to work well in a supervised learning setting, using known English verb classes. They face the problem of having a large number of irrelevant features for a particular clustering task. They used the hierarchical clustering command in Matlab, which implements bottom-up agglomerative clustering, for all the unsupervised experiments. The evaluation was based on the accuracy of assigning members to the correct clusters. The authors discuss their clustering approach to identify that the task becomes difficult if the learning method has to distinguish multiple classes, rather than focus on the important properties of a single class.
