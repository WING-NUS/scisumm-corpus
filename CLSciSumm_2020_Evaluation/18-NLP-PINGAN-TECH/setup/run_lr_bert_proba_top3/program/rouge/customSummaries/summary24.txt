Israeli security officials delayed two planes from clear off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, marking the latest extension in a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
 The control landing is still without controls, the check-in counter has no computers and the runway can't function after dark for lack of flood lights. The Palestinians, in component, accuse Israel of renege on an agreement to bulletin Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
 The airport will be the first unfettered access route Palestinians will have out of the Gaza Strip.
 Now we will be able to recoil without the Israeli procedures that we usually must go through, say Khaled Salmeh, who study economics at Gaza City University and plans to fly next month to Saudi Arabia, for a pilgrimage to Mecca.
