Friday they will again enter, to prepare for the arrival in 1999 of the next major element, the first one both built and financed by Russia. The Russians, whose participation in the partnership clinched the post-Cold War deal five years ago, are now a wild card. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before been assigned to handle an object as massive as the 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakhstan on Nov. The astronauts would be going out anyway Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components. NASA was surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed the orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks before launch of the first part of the new station. Air Force space debris trackers noted that the shuttle was to pass within 1.6 miles of a spent stage of an American booster rocket launched last month. The shuttle and its crew of six snared the Russian-made Zarya control module after chasing it around the Earth in ever-closing orbits throughout the day.
