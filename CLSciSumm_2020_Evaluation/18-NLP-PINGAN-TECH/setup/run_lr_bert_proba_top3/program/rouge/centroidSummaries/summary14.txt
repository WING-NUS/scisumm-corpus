The flow of money into mutual funds is fairly strong, and there is pressure on managers to put that money to work. So last week, for example, Warden produced e-mail from Stephen Case, the chairman of America Online, suggesting a partnership with Netscape Communications Corp. But the two companies, its executives explained, had been evolving toward each other for more than a year. It now has an Internet chat service and runs its own all-in-one site on the Web, known as a portal, which includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment and online shopping. As part of the deal, AOL will agree to purchase about$ 300 million worth of Sun's computers for its service, while Sun will apparently agree to purchase sizeable amounts of Netscape software, which Sun's sales force must sell. But it could be as easily argued that Microsoft has bludgeoned Netscape into dissolution, forcing a distress sale to America Online. Its control of the Windows desktop gives it the most valuable piece of commercial real estate in the information age.
