Palestinian families struggle to keep alive the memories of fathers and brothers languishing in Israeli prisons, and chafe under the checkpoints and gunsights of Israeli troops. Netanyahu said Thursday he will not settle for anything less than a vote, even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success without it. Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip. The Americans have their own procedures as well, said the Palestinian police chief, Ghazi Jabali. The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing excuse after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces a very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down the government in the event of another troop withdrawal. At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday in a confrontation outside the Jewish settlement of Ariel in the northern West Bank. The days leading up to Clinton's visit have been divisive ones, contriving somehow to simultaneously tap into both sides greatest fears.
