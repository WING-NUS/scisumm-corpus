This paper conducted research in the area of automatic paraphrase discovery.  The authors believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system. They proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. They focused on phrases which two Named Entities, and proceed in two stages.  This topic has been getting more attention, driven by the needs of various NLP applications. Most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge by hand and specific tasks. The authors cluster NE instance pairs based on the words in the context using bag-of-words methods. In order to create good-sized vectors for similarity calculation, they had to set a high frequency threshold.
