Foreign names are usually transliterated using hanzi whose sequential pronunciation mimics the source language pronunciation of the name. Besides the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a correct segmentation for a given Chinese sentence, there is the more general issue that the test corpora used in these evaluations differ from system to system, so meaningful comparison between systems is rendered even more difficult. 2 Chinese ?l* han4zi4 'Chinese character'; this is the same word as Japanese kanji.. The most popular approach to dealing with segÃÂ­ mentation ambiguities is the maximum matching method, possibly augmented with further heuristics. The simplest version of the maximum matching algorithm effectively deals with ambiguity by ignoring it, since the method is guaranteed to produce only one segmentation. Purely statistical approaches have not been very popular, and so far as we are aware earlier work by Sproat and Shih (1990) is the only published instance of such an approach. Roughly speaking, previous work can be divided into three categories, namely purely statistical approaches, purely lexiÃÂ­ cal rule-based approaches, and approaches that combine lexical information with staÃÂ­ tistical information. This is an issue that we have not addressed at the current stage of our research. Thus we have some confidence that our own performance is at least as good as that of Chang et al. There are two weaknesses in Chang et al.'s model, which we improve upon. However, we have reason to doubt Chang et al.'s performance claims. In this paper we have argued
