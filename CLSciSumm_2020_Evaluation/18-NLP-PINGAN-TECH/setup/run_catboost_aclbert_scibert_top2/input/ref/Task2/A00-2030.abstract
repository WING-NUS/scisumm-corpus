Since 1995, a few statistical parsing
algorithms have demonstrated a
breakthrough in parsing accuracy, as
measured against the UPenn TREEBANK
as a gold standard. In this paper we report
adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic
context-free parser to information
extraction and evaluate this new technique
on MUC-7 template elements and template
relations.
