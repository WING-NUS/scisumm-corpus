The first is the slight, but important, improvement achieved by using this model over conventional deleted interpolation, as indicated in Figure 2.
The major technical innovation is the use of a &quot;maximum-entropy-inspired&quot; model for conditioning and smoothing that let us successfully to test and combine many different conditioning events.
From our perspective, perhaps the two most important numbers to come out of this research are the overall error reduction of 13% over the results in [9] and the intermediateresult improvement of nearly 2% on labeled precision/recall due to the simple idea of guessing the head's pre-terminal before guessing the head.
