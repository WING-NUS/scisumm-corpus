I have never heard of such a thing, Tsukada told the Associated Press Sunday. He said, If necessary we will expel members if this ad hoc commission thinks these members are guilty. The committee which won the 1998 games for Nagano certainly had to do things which are not legitimate, Hodler said. Samaranch said the IOC would possibly consider a new procedure to eliminate the tempations for corruption in the selection of host cities. Hodler has described as a bribe the dlrs 500,000 scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC members. Salt Lake organizers have denied that the bid committee's dlrs 500,000 project was an effort to buy key IOC members support in the four years between votes on the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games. Welch resigned last year as president of the organizing committee after being accused of domestic violence against his wife. Pound declined to speculate on what if any sanctions could be taken against Salt Lake but did not rule out moving the games elsewhere.
