This paper talks about Unsupervised Models for Named Entity Classification. A large number of rules are needed for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classifier. Here we present two algorithms. The first method builds on results from (Yarowsky 95) and (Blum and Mitchell 98). The second algorithm builds on a boosting algorithm called AdaBoost. The AdaBoost algorithm was developed for supervised learning. We chose one of four labels for each example: location, person, organization, or noise where the noise category was used for items that were outside the three categories. The contextual rules are restricted and may not be applicable to every example, but the spelling rules are generally applicable and should have good coverage.
