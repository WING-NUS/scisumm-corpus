We describe a new approach to SMT adaptation
that weights out-of-domain phrase pairs
according to their relevance to the target domain,
determined by both how similar to it
they appear to be, and whether they belong to
general language or not. This extends previous
work on discriminative weighting by using
a finer granularity, focusing on the properties
of instances rather than corpus components,
and using a simpler training procedure.
We incorporate instance weighting into
a mixture-model framework, and find that it
yields consistent improvements over a wide
range of baselines.
