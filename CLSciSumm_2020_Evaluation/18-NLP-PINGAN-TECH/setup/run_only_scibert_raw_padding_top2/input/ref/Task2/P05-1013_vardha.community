    <S sid="109" ssid="1">We have presented a new method for non-projective dependency parsing, based on a combination of data-driven projective dependency parsing and graph transformation techniques.</S>
 <S sid="95" ssid="6">The second main result is that the pseudo-projective approach to parsing (using special arc labels to guide an inverse transformation) gives a further improvement of about one percentage point on attachment score.</S>

    <S sid="36" ssid="7">As observed by Kahane et al. (1998), any (nonprojective) dependency graph can be transformed into a projective one by a lifting operation, which replaces each non-projective arc wj wk by a projective arc wi &#8212;* wk such that wi &#8212;*&#8727; wj holds in the original graph.</S>
 <S sid="62" ssid="1">In the experiments below, we employ a data-driven deterministic dependency parser producing labeled projective dependency graphs,3 previously tested on Swedish (Nivre et al., 2004) and English (Nivre and Scholz, 2004).</S>

    <S sid="23" ssid="19">By applying an inverse transformation to the output of the parser, arcs with non-standard labels can be lowered to their proper place in the dependency graph, giving rise 1The dependency graph has been modified to make the final period a dependent of the main verb instead of being a dependent of a special root node for the sentence. to non-projective structures.</S>
    <S sid="96" ssid="7">With respect to exact match, the improvement is even more noticeable, which shows quite clearly that even if non-projective dependencies are rare on the token level, they are nevertheless important for getting the global syntactic structure correct.</S>
  <S sid="40" ssid="11">Even this may be nondeterministic, in case the graph contains several non-projective arcs whose lifts interact, but we use the following algorithm to construct a minimal projective transformation D0 = (W, A0) of a (nonprojective) dependency graph D = (W, A): The function SMALLEST-NONP-ARC returns the non-projective arc with the shortest distance from head to dependent (breaking ties from left to right).</S>
  <S sid="7" ssid="3">From the point of view of computational implementation this can be problematic, since the inclusion of non-projective structures makes the parsing problem more complex and therefore compromises efficiency and in practice also accuracy and robustness.</S>
    <S sid="14" ssid="10">While the proportion of sentences containing non-projective dependencies is often 15&#8211;25%, the total proportion of non-projective arcs is normally only 1&#8211;2%.</S>
 <S sid="49" ssid="20">The baseline simply retains the original labels for all arcs, regardless of whether they have been lifted or not, and the number of distinct labels is therefore simply the number n of distinct dependency types.2 In the first encoding scheme, called Head, we use a new label d&#8593;h for each lifted arc, where d is the dependency relation between the syntactic head and the dependent in the non-projective representation, and h is the dependency relation that the syntactic head has to its own head in the underlying structure.</S>
