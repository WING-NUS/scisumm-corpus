 <S sid="11" ssid="1">We evaluated the new approach to information extraction on two of the tasks of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) and reported in (Marsh, 1998).</S>
<S sid="52" ssid="1">In this section, we describe the algorithm that was used to automatically produce augmented trees, starting with a) human-generated semantic annotations and b) machinegenerated syntactic parse trees.</S>
<S sid="50" ssid="10">Figure 4 shows an example of the semantic annotation, which was the only type of manual annotation we performed.</S>
<S sid="34" ssid="2">In these trees, the standard TREEBANK structures are augmented to convey semantic information, that is, entities and relations.</S>
 <S sid="106" ssid="3">We were able to use the Penn TREEBANK to estimate the syntactic parameters; no additional syntactic training was required.</S>
 <S sid="6" ssid="4">In this paper, we report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFG-HR) to information extraction.</S>
<S sid="12" ssid="2">The Template Element (TE) task identifies organizations, persons, locations, and some artifacts (rocket and airplane-related artifacts).</S>
 <S sid="3" ssid="1">Since 1995, a few statistical parsing algorithms (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1996 and 1997; Charniak, 1997; Rathnaparki, 1997) demonstrated a breakthrough in parsing accuracy, as measured against the University of Pennsylvania TREEBANK as a gold standard.</S>
<S sid="32" ssid="15">Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages, we were optimistic that some of their properties &#8212; especially their ability to learn from large amounts of data, and their robustness when presented with unexpected inputs &#8212; would also benefit semantic analysis.</S>
 <S sid="10" ssid="8">Instead, our parsing algorithm, trained on the UPenn TREEBANK, was run on the New York Times source to create unsupervised syntactic training which was constrained to be consistent with semantic annotation.</S>
<S sid="94" ssid="13">Given a new sentence, the outcome of this search process is a tree structure that encodes both the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentence.</S>
    <S sid="6" ssid="4">In this paper, we report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFG-HR) to information extraction.</S>
 <S sid="104" ssid="1">We have demonstrated, at least for one problem, that a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFGHR) can be used effectively for information extraction.</S>
 <S sid="26" ssid="9">We were already using a generative statistical model for part-of-speech tagging (Weischedel et al. 1993), and more recently, had begun using a generative statistical model for name finding (Bikel et al.</S>
<S sid="19" ssid="2">Currently, the prevailing architecture for dividing sentential processing is a four-stage pipeline consisting of: Since we were interested in exploiting recent advances in parsing, replacing the syntactic analysis stage of the standard pipeline with a modern statistical parser was an obvious possibility.</S>
