The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's deadly passage, the EU executive Commission said in a statement. At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday. Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph( 205-kph) winds, topping trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people. Urbizo said Honduran officials hoped the scale of need in next-door Nicaragua wouldn't overshadow Honduras plight. At 0900 GMT Tuesday, Mitch was 95 miles( 152 kilometers) north of Honduras, near the Swan Islands. Mitch is closing in, said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of Utila, an island 20 miles( 32 kilometers) off the Honduran coast. The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras Caribbean coast, killing at least 2,000 people.
