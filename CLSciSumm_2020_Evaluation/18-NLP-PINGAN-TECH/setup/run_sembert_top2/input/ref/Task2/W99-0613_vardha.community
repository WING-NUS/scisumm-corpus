    <S sid="9" ssid="3">This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification.</S>
    <S sid="35" ssid="29">AdaBoost finds a weighted combination of simple (weak) classifiers, where the weights are chosen to minimize a function that bounds the classification error on a set of training examples.</S>
    <S sid="134" ssid="1">This section describes an algorithm based on boosting algorithms, which were previously developed for supervised machine learning problems.</S>
    <S sid="236" ssid="3">We chose one of four labels for each example: location, person, organization, or noise where the noise category was used for items that were outside the three categories.</S>
    <S sid="8" ssid="2">Recent results (e.g., (Yarowsky 95; Brill 95; Blum and Mitchell 98)) have suggested that unlabeled data can be used quite profitably in reducing the need for supervision.</S>
    <S sid="42" ssid="36">(Riloff and Shepherd 97) describe a bootstrapping approach for acquiring nouns in particular categories (such as &amp;quot;vehicle&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;weapon&amp;quot; categories).</S>
    <S sid="222" ssid="1">The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster, Laird and Rubin 77) is a common approach for unsupervised training; in this section we describe its application to the named entity problem.</S>
    <S sid="30" ssid="24">(Blum and Mitchell 98) offer a promising formulation of redundancy, also prove some results about how the use of can help classification, and suggest an objective function when training with unlabeled examples.</S>
 <S sid="26" ssid="20">We present two algorithms.</S>
    <S sid="7" ssid="1">Many statistical or machine-learning approaches for natural language problems require a relatively large amount of supervision, in the form of labeled training examples.</S>
    <S sid="32" ssid="26">The algorithm can be viewed as heuristically optimizing an objective function suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98); empirically it is shown to be quite successful in optimizing this criterion.</S>
    <S sid="47" ssid="1">971,746 sentences of New York Times text were parsed using the parser of (Collins 96).1 Word sequences that met the following criteria were then extracted as named entity examples: whose head is a singular noun (tagged NN).</S>
    <S sid="127" ssid="60">The DL-CoTrain algorithm can be motivated as being a greedy method of satisfying the above 2 constraints.</S>
