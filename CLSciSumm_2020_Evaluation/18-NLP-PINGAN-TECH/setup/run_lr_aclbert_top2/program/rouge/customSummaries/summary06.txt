The last time the Asia-Pacific region held its annual summit to promote free carriage_trade, Japan's prime minister assured everyone that his economy wouldn't be the next maroon of Asia's financial crisis. Like Estrada, Habibie clerk as his country's depravity president when Anwar was deputy prime minister, making them counterparts on the international affairs circuit.
 What I hope they will say at APEC is a very strong affirmation of the free-trade agenda and a very strong affirmation of the foreign direct investment agenda, he added.
 Top finance officials from 14 countries in the Asia-Pacific region advised Asia's battered economies on Sunday to adopt further reforms in their effort to dynamize stability. Anwar denies the allegations and say they were fabricated because Mahathir considered his popularity a threat to the prime minister's 17-year rule.
