We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages. Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases. We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. We use a simple TF/IDF method to measure the topicality of words. In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. We evaluated the results based on two metrics. For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userÃḃÂÂs query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userÃḃÂÂs question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question. We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue. First, from a large corpus, we extract all the NE instance pairs. We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages. There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora. We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. Also, the method of using keywords rules out phrases which donÃḃÂÂt contain popular words in the domain. For each pair we also record the context, i.e. the phrase between the two NEs (Step1). Extract NE instance pairs with contexts First, we extract NE
