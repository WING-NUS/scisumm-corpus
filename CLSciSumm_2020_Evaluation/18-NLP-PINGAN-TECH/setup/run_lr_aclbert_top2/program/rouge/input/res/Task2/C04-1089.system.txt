The work that is most similar to ours is the recent research of (Huang et al., 2004). Comparable corpora such as news documents of the same period from different news agencies are readily available. In this paper, we present a new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information. In this paper, we propose a new approach for the task of mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining both context and transliteration information. Chinese Giga- word corpus consists of news from two agencies: = ÃḃÂÂÃḃÂÂ P(l a a i | pi ) Xinhua News Agency and Central News Agency.
