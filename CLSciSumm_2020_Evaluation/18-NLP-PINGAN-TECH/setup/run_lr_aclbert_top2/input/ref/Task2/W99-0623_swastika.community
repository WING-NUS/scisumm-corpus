<S sid="85" ssid="14">We then show that the combining techniques presented above give better parsing accuracy than any of the individual parsers.</S>
<S sid="120" ssid="49">The precision and recall of similarity switching and constituent voting are both significantly better than the best individual parser, and constituent voting is significantly better than parser switching in precision.4 Constituent voting gives the highest accuracy for parsing the Penn Treebank reported to date.</S>
<S sid="25" ssid="11">In our particular case the majority requires the agreement of only two parsers because we have only three.</S>
<S sid="38" ssid="24">Under certain conditions the constituent voting and na&#239;ve Bayes constituent combination techniques are guaranteed to produce sets of constituents with no crossing brackets.</S>
<S sid="91" ssid="20">Features and context were initially introduced into the models, but they refused to offer any gains in performance.</S>
<S sid="139" ssid="1">We have presented two general approaches to studying parser combination: parser switching and parse hybridization.</S>
<S sid="103" ssid="32">The counts represent portions of the approximately 44000 constituents hypothesized by the parsers in the development set.</S>
<S sid="70" ssid="56">In this case we are interested in finding' the maximum probability parse, ri, and Mi is the set of relevant (binary) parsing decisions made by parser i. ri is a parse selected from among the outputs of the individual parsers.</S>
<S sid="140" ssid="2">For each experiment we gave an nonparametric and a parametric technique for combining parsers.</S>
<S sid="85" ssid="14">We then show that the combining techniques presented above give better parsing accuracy than any of the individual parsers.</S>
