We describe an annotation scheme and a
tool developed for creating linguistically
annotated corpora for non-configurational
languages. Since the requirements for such
a formalism differ from those posited for
configurational languages, several features
have been added, influencing the architecture
of the scheme. The resulting
scheme reflects a stratificational notion of
language, and makes only minimal assumptions
about the interrelation of the particu-
Jar representational strata.
