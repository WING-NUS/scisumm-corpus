<S sid="4" ssid="1">Domain adaptation is a common concern when optimizing empirical NLP applications.</S>
<S sid="132" ssid="1">We have already mentioned the closely related work by Matsoukas et al (2009) on discriminative corpus weighting, and Jiang and Zhai (2007) on (nondiscriminative) instance weighting.</S>
<S sid="7" ssid="4">For developers of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems, an additional complication is the heterogeneous nature of SMT components (word-alignment model, language model, translation model, etc.</S>
<S sid="62" ssid="26">To approximate these baselines, we implemented a very simple sentence selection algorithm in which parallel sentence pairs from OUT are ranked by the perplexity of their target half according to the IN language model.</S>
<S sid="50" ssid="14">Linear weights are difficult to incorporate into the standard MERT procedure because they are &#8220;hidden&#8221; within a top-level probability that represents the linear combination.1 Following previous work (Foster and Kuhn, 2007), we circumvent this problem by choosing weights to optimize corpus loglikelihood, which is roughly speaking the training criterion used by the LM and TM themselves.</S>
<S sid="152" ssid="9">We will also directly compare with a baseline similar to the Matsoukas et al approach in order to measure the benefit from weighting phrase pairs (or ngrams) rather than full sentences.</S>
<S sid="144" ssid="1">In this paper we have proposed an approach for instance-weighting phrase pairs in an out-of-domain corpus in order to improve in-domain performance.</S>
 <S sid="9" ssid="6">In this paper we study the problem of using a parallel corpus from a background domain (OUT) to improve performance on a target domain (IN) for which a smaller amount of parallel training material&#8212;though adequate for reasonable performance&#8212;is also available.</S>
<S sid="75" ssid="12">However, it is robust, efficient, and easy to implement.4 To perform the maximization in (7), we used the popular L-BFGS algorithm (Liu and Nocedal, 1989), which requires gradient information.</S>
<S sid="28" ssid="25">We train linear mixture models for conditional phrase pair probabilities over IN and OUT so as to maximize the likelihood of an empirical joint phrase-pair distribution extracted from a development set.</S>
<S sid="97" ssid="1">We carried out translation experiments in two different settings.</S>
<S sid="143" ssid="12">Other work includes transferring latent topic distributions from source to target language for LM adaptation, (Tam et al., 2007) and adapting features at the sentence level to different categories of sentence (Finch and Sumita, 2008).</S>
<S sid="153" ssid="10">Finally, we intend to explore more sophisticated instanceweighting features for capturing the degree of generality of phrase pairs.</S>
<S sid="141" ssid="10">Moving beyond directly related work, major themes in SMT adaptation include the IR (Hildebrand et al., 2005; L&#168;u et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2004) and mixture (Finch and Sumita, 2008; Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Koehn and Schroeder, 2007; L&#168;u et al., 2007) approaches for LMs and TMs described above, as well as methods for exploiting monolingual in-domain text, typically by translating it automatically and then performing self training (Bertoldi and Federico, 2009; Ueffing et al., 2007; Schwenk and Senellart, 2009).</S>
 <S sid="28" ssid="25">We train linear mixture models for conditional phrase pair probabilities over IN and OUT so as to maximize the likelihood of an empirical joint phrase-pair distribution extracted from a development set.</S>
<S sid="37" ssid="1">Standard SMT systems have a hierarchical parameter structure: top-level log-linear weights are used to combine a small set of complex features, interpreted as log probabilities, many of which have their own internal parameters and objectives.</S>
