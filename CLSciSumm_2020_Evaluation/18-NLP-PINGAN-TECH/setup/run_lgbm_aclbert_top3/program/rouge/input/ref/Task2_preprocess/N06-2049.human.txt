In this paper, the authors proposed a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a pre-defined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters. Their word segmentation process is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subwordbased tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging. They used the data from the Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test their approaches.By these techniques, they achieved higher F-scores in City University of Hong Kong (CITYU), Peking University (PKU) and Microsoft Research in Beijing (MSR) corpora than the best results from Sighan Bakeoff 2005.This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on users’ requirements to R-oov(range out-of-vocabulary) and R-iv(range inside-vocabulary).
