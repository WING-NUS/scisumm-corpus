The author aims at describing an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages. It also aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora ('treebanks') for stochastic grammar induction. In particular, they focus on several methodological issues concerning the annotation of non-configurational languages. They will closely coordinate the further development of the corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation. Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a demand for very large corpora, efficiency of annotation is an important criterion for the success of the developed methodology and tools. Their annotation tool supplies efficient manipulation and immediate visualization of argument structures. Partial automation included it, the current version significantly reduces the manual effort. Its extension is subject to further investigations.
