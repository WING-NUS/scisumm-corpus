This corresponds to an error reduction of 13% over the best previously published single parser results on this test set, those of Collins [9].
We present a new parser for parsing down to Penn tree-bank style parse trees that achieves 90.1% average precision/recall for sentences of 40 and less, and for of length 100 and less when trained and tested on the previously established [5,9,10,15,17] &quot;standard&quot; sections of the Wall Street Journal treebank.
