The paper 'Learning Dependency-Based Compositional Semantics' by Percy Liang,Michael I. Jordan and Dan Klein propose a new way to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs.The main technical contribution of this work is a new semantic representation, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which is both simple and expressive. The logical forms in this framework are trees, which is desirable for two reasons: (i) they parallel syntactic dependency trees,which facilitates parsing and learning; and (ii) evaluating them to obtain the answer is computationally efficient.The logical forms in DCS are called DCS trees,where nodes are labeled with predicates, and edges are labeled with relations.DCS trees are learned from Question-Answer pairs and database entries.They trained their model using an EM-like algorithm on two benchmarks, GEO and JOBS. Their system outperforms all existing systems despite using no annotated logical forms.
