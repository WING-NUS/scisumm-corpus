We propose a cascaded linear model for
joint Chinese word segmentation and partof-
speech tagging. With a character-based
perceptron as the core, combined with realvalued
features such as language models, the
cascaded model is able to efficiently utilize
knowledge sources that are inconvenient
to incorporate into the perceptron directly.
Experiments show that the cascaded model
achieves improved accuracies on both segmentation
only and joint segmentation and
part-of-speech tagging. On the Penn Chinese
Treebank 5.0, we obtain an error reduction of
18.5% on segmentation and 12% on joint segmentation
and part-of-speech tagging over the
perceptron-only baseline.
