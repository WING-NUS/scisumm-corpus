That the previous three best parsers on this test [5,9,17] all perform within a percentage point of each other, despite quite different basic mechanisms, led some researchers to wonder if there might be some maximum level of parsing performance that could be obtained using the treebank for training, and to conjecture that perhaps we were at it.
This quantity is a relatively intuitive one (as, for example, it is the quantity used in a PCFG to relate words to their pre-terminals) and it seems particularly good to condition upon here since we use it, in effect, as the unsmoothed probability upon which all smoothing of p(h) is based.
