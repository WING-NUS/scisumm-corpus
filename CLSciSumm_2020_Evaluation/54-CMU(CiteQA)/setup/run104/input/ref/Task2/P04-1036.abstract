In word sense disambiguation (WSD), the heuristic
of choosing the most common sense is extremely
powerful because the distribution of the senses of a
word is often skewed. The problem with using the
predominant, or first sense heuristic, aside from the
fact that it does not take surrounding context into
account, is that it assumes some quantity of handtagged
data. Whilst there are a few hand-tagged
corpora available for some languages, one would
expect the frequency distribution of the senses of
words, particularly topical words, to depend on the
genre and domain of the text under consideration.
We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired
from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity
package to find predominant noun senses automatically.
The acquired predominant senses give a
precision of 64% on the nouns of the SENSEVAL-
2 English all-words task. This is a very promising
result given that our method does not require any
hand-tagged text, such as SemCor. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our method discovers appropriate
predominant senses for words from two domainspecific
corpora.
