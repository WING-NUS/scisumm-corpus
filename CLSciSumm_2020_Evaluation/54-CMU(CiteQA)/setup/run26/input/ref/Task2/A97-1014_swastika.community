<S sid="168" ssid="10">We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation.</S>
<S sid="151" ssid="32">For evaluation, the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets, one for training (90% of the corpus), the other one for testing (10%).</S>
<S sid="15" ssid="5">Existing treebank annotation schemes exhibit a fairly uniform architecture, as they all have to meet the same basic requirements, namely: Descriptivity: Grammatical phenomena are to be described rather than explained.</S>
<S sid="47" ssid="37">Argument structure can be represented in terms of unordered trees (with crossing branches).</S>
<S sid="167" ssid="9">In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created.</S>
<S sid="4" ssid="1">The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks') for stochastic grammar induction.</S>
<S sid="160" ssid="2">These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme.</S>
<S sid="127" ssid="8">As the need for certain functionalities becomes obvious with growing annotation experience, we have decided to implement the tool in two stages.</S>
<S sid="39" ssid="29">Consider the German sentence (1) daran wird ihn Anna erkennen, &amp;di er weint at-it will him Anna recognise that he cries 'Anna will recognise him at his cry' A sample constituent structure is given below: The fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies, marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes.</S>
<S sid="72" ssid="17">In order to avoid inconsistencies, the corpus is annotated in two stages: basic annotation and nfirtellte714.</S>
