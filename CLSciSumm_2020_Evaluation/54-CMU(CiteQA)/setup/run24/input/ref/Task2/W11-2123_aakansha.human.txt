This paper presents KenLM, a library that implements two data structures for efficient language model queries.The paper explains methods to query N-gram language models, minimizing time and space costs.It implements two data structures: PROBING , designed for speed, and TRIE , optimized for memory.It attains results using several optimizations: hashing,custom lookup tables, bit-level packing, and state for left-to-right query patterns.The PROBING model is 2.4 times as fast as the fastest alternative, SRILM, and uses less memory too. The TRIE model uses less memory than the smallest lossless alternative and is still faster than SRILM.
