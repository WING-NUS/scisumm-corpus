The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant. The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. Chilean President Eduardo Frei criticized the arrest, saying the Spanish magistrate's arrest order was tantamount to not recognizing Chile's institutions. The arrest warrant, however, referred only to questioning about allegations that he killed Spaniards in Chile between 1973 and 1983. In London, British officials keep insisting that Pinochet's case will be decided by the courts and not politically, yet the issue has stirred intense political activity both in Britain and in Chile. Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it a case of international meddling.
