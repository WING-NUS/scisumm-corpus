In this paper the authors present a stochastic finite-state model for segmenting Chinese text into words.The model incorporates various recent techniques for incorporating and manipulating linguistic knowledge using finite-state transducers. It also incorporates the Good-Turing methodin estimating the likelihoods of previously unseen constructions, including morphological derivatives and personal names. they evaluate various specific aspects of the segmentation, as well as the overall segmentation performance. The evaluation compares the performance of the system with that of several human judges and inter-human agreement on a single correct way to segment a text.they showed that the average agreement among the human judges is .76, and the average agreement between ST(system) and the humans is .75, or about 99% of the interhuman agreement.This architecture provides a uniform framework in which it is easy to incorporate not only listed dictionary entries but also morphological derivatives, and models for personal names and foreign names in transliteration. Other kinds of productive word classes, such as company names, abbreviations,and place names can easily be handled given appropriate models.
