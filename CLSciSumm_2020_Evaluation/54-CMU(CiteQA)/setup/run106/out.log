<S ssid="1" sid="46">By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output, we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output, which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.</S><S ssid="1" sid="1">Adequacy (rank) Fluency (rank) BLEU (rank) upc-jmc (1-7) (1-8) (1-6) lcc (1-6) (1-7) (1-4) utd (1-7) (1-6) (2-7) upc-mr (1-8) (1-6) (1-7) nrc

<S ssid="1" sid="46">By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output, we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output, which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.</S><S ssid="1" sid="1">Adequacy (rank) Fluency (rank) BLEU (rank) upc-jmc (1-7) (1-8) (1-6) lcc (1-6) (1-7) (1-4) utd (1-7) (1-6) (2-7) upc-mr (1-8) (1-6) (1-7) nrc

<S ssid="1" sid="46">By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output, we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output, which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.</S><S ssid="1" sid="1">Adequacy (rank) Fluency (rank) BLEU (rank) upc-jmc (1-7) (1-8) (1-6) lcc (1-6) (1-7) (1-4) utd (1-7) (1-6) (2-7) upc-mr (1-8) (1-6) (1-7) nrc

['The parser performs two basic operations: (i) shifting, which involves pushing the POS label of the next word onto the stack and moving the pointer to the following word in the input string; and (ii) reducing, which takes the top k stack entries and replaces them with a single new entry, the nonterminal label of which is the left-hand side of a rule in the grammar that has the k top stack entry labels on the right-hand side.']

['If the left-hand side of the production is a POS, then the algorithm takes the right branch of the decision tree, and returns (at level 4) the POS of the closest c-commanding lexical head to A, which it finds by walking the parse tree; if the left-hand side of the rule is not a POS, then the algorithm returns (at level 4) the closest sibling to the left of the parent of constituent (A).', "If the parent of a VP is another VP (i.e., if an auxiliary or modal verb is used), then the distribution over productions is different than if the parent is an S. Conditioning on head information, both POS of the head and the lexical item itself, has proven useful as well, although given our parser's left-to-right orientation, in many cases the head has not been encountered within the particular constituent.", 'The parser performs two basic operations: (i) shifting, which involves pushing the POS label of the next word onto the stack and moving the pointer to the following word in the input string; and (ii) reducing, which takes the top k stack entries and replaces them with a single new entry, the nonterminal label of which is the left-hand side of a rule in the grammar that has the k top stack entry labels on the right-hand side.']

<S ssid="1" sid="46">By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output, we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output, which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.</S><S ssid="1" sid="1">Adequacy (rank) Fluency (rank) BLEU (rank) upc-jmc (1-7) (1-8) (1-6) lcc (1-6) (1-7) (1-4) utd (1-7) (1-6) (2-7) upc-mr (1-8) (1-6) (1-7) nrc

<S ssid="1" sid="46">By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output, we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output, which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.</S><S ssid="1" sid="1">Adequacy (rank) Fluency (rank) BLEU (rank) upc-jmc (1-7) (1-8) (1-6) lcc (1-6) (1-7) (1-4) utd (1-7) (1-6) (2-7) upc-mr (1-8) (1-6) (1-7) nrc

<S ssid="1" sid="46">By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output, we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output, which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.</S><S ssid="1" sid="1">Adequacy (rank) Fluency (rank) BLEU (rank) upc-jmc (1-7) (1-8) (1-6) lcc (1-6) (1-7) (1-4) utd (1-7) (1-6) (2-7) upc-mr (1-8) (1-6) (1-7) nrc
