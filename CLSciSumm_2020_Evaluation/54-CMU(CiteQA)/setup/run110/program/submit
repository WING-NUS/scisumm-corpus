We created a parser based upon the maximumentropy-inspired model of the last section, smoothed using standard deleted interpolation.
This parser achieves an average precision/recall of 86.2%.
Between the Old model and the Best model, Figure 2 gives precision/recall measurements for several different versions of our parser.
