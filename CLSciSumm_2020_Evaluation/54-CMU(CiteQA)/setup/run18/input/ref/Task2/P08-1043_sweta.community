<S sid="156" ssid="34">To evaluate the performance on the segmentation task, we report SEG, the standard harmonic means for segmentation Precision and Recall F1 (as defined in Bar-Haim et al. (2005); Tsarfaty (2006)) as well as the segmentation accuracy SEGTok measure indicating the percentage of input tokens assigned the correct exact segmentation (as reported by Cohen and Smith (2007)).</S>
<S sid="4" ssid="4">Using a treebank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling technique our model outperforms previous pipelined, integrated or factorized systems for Hebrew morphological and syntactic processing, yielding an error reduction of 12% over the best published results so far.</S>
<S sid="70" ssid="2">Each lattice arc corresponds to a segment and its corresponding PoS tag, and a path through the lattice corresponds to a specific morphological segmentation of the utterance.</S>
<S sid="3" ssid="3">Here we propose a single joint model for performing both morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation which bypasses the associated circularity.</S>
<S sid="51" ssid="9">Tsarfaty (2006) used a morphological analyzer (Segal, 2000), a PoS tagger (Bar-Haim et al., 2005), and a general purpose parser (Schmid, 2000) in an integrated framework in which morphological and syntactic components interact to share information, leading to improved performance on the joint task.</S>
<S sid="107" ssid="39">Firstly, Hebrew unknown tokens are doubly unknown: each unknown token may correspond to several segmentation possibilities, and each segment in such sequences may be able to admit multiple PoS tags.</S>
<S sid="14" ssid="10">The input for the segmentation task is however highly ambiguous for Semitic languages, and surface forms (tokens) may admit multiple possible analyses as in (BarHaim et al., 2007; Adler and Elhadad, 2006).</S>
<S sid="33" ssid="12">The current work treats both segmental and super-segmental phenomena, yet we note that there may be more adequate ways to treat supersegmental phenomena assuming Word-Based morphology as we explore in (Tsarfaty and Goldberg, 2008).</S>
<S sid="53" ssid="11">Both (Tsarfaty, 2006; Cohen and Smith, 2007) have shown that a single integrated framework outperforms a completely streamlined implementation, yet neither has shown a single generative model which handles both tasks.</S>
 <S sid="48" ssid="6">Tsarfaty (2006) was the first to demonstrate that fully automatic Hebrew parsing is feasible using the newly available 5000 sentences treebank.</S>
<S sid="141" ssid="19">This analyzer setting is similar to that of (Cohen and Smith, 2007), and models using it are denoted nohsp, Parser and Grammar We used BitPar (Schmid, 2004), an efficient general purpose parser,10 together with various treebank grammars to parse the input sentences and propose compatible morphological segmentation and syntactic analysis.</S>
<S sid="188" ssid="2">The overall performance of our joint framework demonstrates that a probability distribution obtained over mere syntactic contexts using a Treebank grammar and a data-driven lexicon outperforms upper bounds proposed by previous joint disambiguation systems and achieves segmentation and parsing results on a par with state-of-the-art standalone applications results.</S>
<S sid="94" ssid="26">Our use of an unweighted lattice reflects our belief that all the segmentations of the given input sentence are a-priori equally likely; the only reason to prefer one segmentation over the another is due to the overall syntactic context which is modeled via the PCFG derivations.</S>
<S sid="134" ssid="12">Such resources exist for Hebrew (Itai et al., 2006), but unfortunately use a tagging scheme which is incompatible with the one of the Hebrew Treebank.s For this reason, we use a data-driven morphological analyzer derived from the training data similar to (Cohen and Smith, 2007).</S>

<S sid="5" ssid="1">Current state-of-the-art broad-coverage parsers assume a direct correspondence between the lexical items ingrained in the proposed syntactic analyses (the yields of syntactic parse-trees) and the spacedelimited tokens (henceforth, &#8216;tokens&#8217;) that constitute the unanalyzed surface forms (utterances).</S>
