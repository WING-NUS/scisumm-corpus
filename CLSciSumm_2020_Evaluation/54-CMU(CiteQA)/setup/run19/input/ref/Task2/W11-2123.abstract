We present KenLM, a library that implements
two data structures for efficient language
model queries, reducing both time and
memory costs. The PROBING data structure
uses linear probing hash tables and is designed
for speed. Compared with the widelyused
SRILM, our PROBING model is 2.4
times as fast while using 57% of the memory.
The TRIE data structure is a trie with
bit-level packing, sorted records, interpolation
search, and optional quantization aimed
at lower memory consumption. TRIE simultaneously
uses less memory than the smallest
lossless baseline and less CPU than the
fastest baseline. Our code is open-source1,
thread-safe, and integrated into the Moses,
cdec, and Joshua translation systems. This
paper describes the several performance techniques
used and presents benchmarks against
alternative implementations.
