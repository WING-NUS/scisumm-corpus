<S sid="2" ssid="2">In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs.</S>
S sid="9" ssid="5">As in Clarke et al. (2010), we obviate the need for annotated logical forms by considering the endto-end problem of mapping questions to answers.</S>
<S sid="21" ssid="17">The main technical contribution of this work is a new semantic representation, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which is both simple and expressive (Section 2).</S>

<S sid="112" ssid="88">Our learning algorithm alternates between (i) using the current parameters &#952; to generate the K-best set &#732;ZL,&#952;(x) for each training example x, and (ii) optimizing the parameters to put probability mass on the correct trees in these sets; sets containing no correct answers are skipped.</S>
<S sid="35" ssid="11">Although a DCS tree is a logical form, note that it looks like a syntactic dependency tree with predicates in place of words.</S>
<S sid="10" ssid="6">However, we still model the logical form (now as a latent variable) to capture the complexities of language.</S>
<S sid="36" ssid="12">It is this transparency between syntax and semantics provided by DCS which leads to a simple and streamlined compositional semantics suitable for program induction.</S>
<S sid="42" ssid="18">The denotation JzKw (z evaluated on w) is the set of consistent values of the root node (see Figure 2 for an example).</S>
<S sid="106" ssid="82">Learning Given a training dataset D containing (x, y) pairs, we define the regularized marginal log-likelihood objective O(&#952;) = E(x,y)ED log p&#952;(JzKw = y  |x, z &#8712; ZL(x)) &#8722; &#955;k&#952;k22, which sums over all DCS trees z that evaluate to the target answer y.</S>
<S sid="45" ssid="21">The logical forms in DCS are called DCS trees, where nodes are labeled with predicates, and edges are labeled with relations.</S>
