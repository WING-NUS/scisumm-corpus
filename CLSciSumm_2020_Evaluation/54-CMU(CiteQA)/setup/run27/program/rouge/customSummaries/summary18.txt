Although this was considered a morning-after_pill distance, shuttle controllers decided to diversify the hour to five miles as an extra precaution.
 For the second day in a rotation, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight. The planet's most daring construction job began Friday as the shuttle Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first U.S.-built part of an international space station that is anticipate to cost more than$ 100 billion. The six astronauts began to emerge from the shuttle an hour later and ultimately promise for bed to rest up for another attempt early Friday.
 Most experts outside the agency consider this figure ridiculously low because it ignore many billions of dollars spent in early development activation_energy as well as the cost of numerous shuttle flights, which zoom about$ 800 million apiece.
