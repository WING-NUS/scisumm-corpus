Wenbin Jiang,Liang Huang,Qun Liu and Yajuan Lu in their paper 'A Cascaded Linear Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging'proposes a cascaded linear model inspired by the log-linear model for joint Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging.the cascaded model has a two-layer architecture, with a character based perceptron as the core combined with other real-valued features such as language models.Other than the usual character-based features, additional features dependent on POSâ€™s or words are also employed to improve the performance.Experimental results show that, it achieves obvious improvement over the perceptron-only model, about from 0.973 to 0.978 on segmentation, and from 0.925 to 0.934 on Joint S&T, with error reductions of 18.5% and 12% respectively.
