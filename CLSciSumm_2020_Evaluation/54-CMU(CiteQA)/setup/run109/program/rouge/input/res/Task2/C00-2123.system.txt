In this paper, we have presented a new, eÃÂcient DP-based search procedure for statistical machine translation. In this case, we have no finite-state restrictions for the search space. A position is presented by the word at that position. Restrictions We compare our new approach with the word reordering used in the IBM translation approach (Berger et al., 1996). Translation errors are reported in terms of multireference word error rate (mWER) and subjective sentence error rate (SSER). Source sentence words are aligned with hypothesized target sentence words, where the choice of a new source word, which has not been aligned with a target word yet, is restricted1. The model is often further restricted so that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word (Brown et al., 1993; Ney et al., 2000). Our approach uses word-to-word dependencies between source and target words. In German, the verbgroup usually consists of a left and a right verbal brace, whereas in English the words of the verbgroup usually form a sequence of consecutive words. The alignment mapping is j ! i = aj from source position j to target position i = aj . The use of this alignment model raises major problems if a source word has to be aligned to several target words, e.g. when translating German compound nouns. In this paper, we have presented a new, eÃÂcient DP-based search procedure for statistical machine translation. The complexity of the algorithm is O(E3 J2 2J), where E is the size of the
