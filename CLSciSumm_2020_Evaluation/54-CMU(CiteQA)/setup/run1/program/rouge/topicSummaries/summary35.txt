Prodi was even forced to resign a year ago after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked to the euro. But his fiscal discipline was not followed by reform of a political system that is inherently fragile. The party forced him to offer his resignation last year over proposed budget cuts, but then backpeddled after the party's rank and file protested. The country needs stability and credibility, and that will never happen as long as the government is hanging from a thread. Though obliged to tender his resignation, Prodi will remain in charge as a caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed. If Scalfaro feels no candidate is capable of mustering a majority, he could call early elections. He is expected to go to Parliament on Wednesday to open debate on the crisis and seek enough votes for the budget. Despite frequent shocks, the alliance has held since 1996, glued together mainly by the desire to meet the fiscal requirements to allow Italy to adopt the single European currency.
