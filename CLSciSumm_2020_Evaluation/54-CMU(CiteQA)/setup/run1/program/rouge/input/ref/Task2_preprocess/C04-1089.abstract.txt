<S sid="0">Mining New Word Translations from Comparable Corpora</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">New words such as names, technical terms, etc appear frequently.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">As such, the bilingual lexicon of a machine translation system has to be constantly updated with these new word translations.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Comparable corpora such as news documents of the same period from different news agencies are readily available.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">In this paper, we present a new approach to mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by using context information to complement transliteration information.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">We evaluated our approach on six months of Chinese and English Gigaword corpora, with encouraging results.</S>
