In this paper, the author aims to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs. In tackling this challenging learning problem, he introduces a new semantic representation which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms. The dominant paradigm in compositional semantics is Montague semantics, which constructs lambda calculus forms in a bottom-up manner. CCG is one instantiation, which is used by many semantic parsers. The main technical contribution of this work is a new semantic representation, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which is both simple and expressive. The logical forms in this framework are trees, which is desirable for two reasons: (i) they parallel syntactic dependency trees, which facilitates parsing and learning; and (ii) evaluating them to obtain the answer is computationally efficient. Free from the burden of annotating logical forms, the author hopes to use their techniques in developing even more accurate and broader-coverage language understanding systems.
