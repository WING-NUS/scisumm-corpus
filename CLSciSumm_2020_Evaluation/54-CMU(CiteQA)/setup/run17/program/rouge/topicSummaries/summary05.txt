The silence of their march was interrupted only by the singing of crickets and the clanging of the bullet belts hanging around the soldiers necks. It was impossible to say who had the upper hand in the battle for Kindu and its air base, which government forces have been using to launch airstrikes on eastern towns and to assemble ground troops. Majera said the attackers avoided a nearby army post when they shot up the village. Rebel military sources said the fighting continued inside Kindu where the rebels were apparently meeting stiff resistance. Since then, the rebels have been confined to a chunk of territory in the extreme eastern part of the country where their rebellion was declared Aug. Rebels in eastern Congo on Saturday said they shot down a passenger jet ferrying 40 government soldiers into a strategic airport facing a rebel assault. Some troops reportedly retreated through a single road corridor leading out of the town. Today, its decaying buildings, empty shops and crumbling guest houses are home to rebel leaders, soldiers and people displaced by violence.
