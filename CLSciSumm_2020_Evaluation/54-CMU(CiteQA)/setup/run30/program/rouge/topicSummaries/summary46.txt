Microsoft argues and many antitrust experts agree that the courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing test toward a simpler predation test for exclusionary contracts. It dispatched hundreds of programmers to work on a competing browser and poured many millions of dollars into marketing it. Microsoft will have an easier time defending itself against a charge of predation, which amounts to victimizing its customers, than it would defending itself against a charge that its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good. At the same time, they say, new evidence was coming in as the investigation moved ahead and prosecutors raced to meet the accelerated trial schedule approved by the court. But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped or hurt is up for grabs. The news conference got little attention, just a few articles deep inside newspapers and trade publications. Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately.
