<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">Supersense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organise their manual insertion into WORDNET.</S>
<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Some specialist topics are better covered in WORD- NET than others, e.g. dog has finer-grained distinctions than cat and worm although this does not reflect finer distinctions in reality; limited coverage of infrequent words and senses.</S>
<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNETâ€™s hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.</S>
<S sid ="65" ssid = "18">Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) implement a super- sense tagger based on the multi-class perceptron classifier (Crammer and Singer, 2001), which uses the standard collocation, spelling and syntactic features common in WSD and named entity recognition systems.</S>
<S sid ="87" ssid = "1">Similarity Vector-space models of similarity are based on the distributional hypothesis that similar words appear in similar contexts.</S>
<S sid ="147" ssid = "1">Our approach uses voting across the known supersenses of automatically extracted synonyms, to select a super- sense for the unknown nouns.</S>
<S sid ="228" ssid = "4">Each synonym votes for each of its supersenses from WORDNET 1.6 using the similarity score from our synonym extractor.</S> 
<S sid ="231" ssid = "7">Such a corpus is needed to acquire reliable contextual information for the often very rare nouns we are attempting to supersense tag.</S>
