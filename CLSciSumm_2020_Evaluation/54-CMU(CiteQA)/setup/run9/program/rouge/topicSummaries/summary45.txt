The president insists he has no major health problems and will serve out the remaining two years of his term. He canceled most of his public engagements, except for a state dinner at which he made rambling remarks and a news conference that he abruptly cut short.
 Yeltsin has flatly said he will not seek another term, and the opposition has concentrated its efforts on demanding an early resignation, riding a wave of popular discontent over the economic crisis. The upper house of parliament was busy voting on a motion saying he should resign. The call for Yeltsin to step down was backed by many participants in a nationwide labor action earlier this month that attracted about 1 million people. Hours after he returned to work, the generally pro-Yeltsin upper house of parliament fell just 11 votes short of passing a motion urging him to step down over his social welfare policies. The motion carries no legal weight, but it reflects growing anti-Yeltsin sentiment in a chamber that has generally supported him.
