The two sides remained apart on several ideological matters, including whether to allow federal health plans to cover contraceptives and whether to allow those few plans with religious affiliations to refuse to cover contraceptives not only on religious grounds but on moral grounds as well. The idea then was that holding all three departments hostage in the census fight would place maximum pressure on all sides to work out their differences over sampling. This will actually raise a small amount of revenue in the next five years the period covered by budget accounting but it will make the picture considerably worse in later years. The contraceptive measure is one of four related matters that have helped stall four spending bills. But the opponents of abortion were furious about the approval and persuaded Republican leaders to have negotiators reopen discussion on the matter. Also to be resolved are a host of issues that have little to do with financing and more to do with ideology, including environmental matters, contraception and national student testing.
