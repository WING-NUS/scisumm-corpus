<S sid="15" ssid="8">Whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as SemCor is clearly useful, there is a strong case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a WSD system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.</S>
<S sid="41" ssid="34">In this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses.</S>
<S sid="4" ssid="4">We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically.</S>

"<S sid=""180"" ssid=""3"">The automatically acquired predominant senses were evaluated against the hand-tagged resources SemCor and the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task giving us a WSD precision of 64% on an all-nouns task.</S>
    <S sid=""181"" ssid=""4"">This is just 5% lower than results using the first sense in the manually labelled SemCor, and we obtain 67% precision on polysemous nouns that are not in SemCor.</S>"
<S sid="126" ssid="3">We demonstrate that choosing texts from a particular domain has a significant influence on the sense ranking.</S>
S sid="48" ssid="4">To find the first sense of a word ( ) we take each sense in turn and obtain a score reflecting the prevalence which is used for ranking.</S>
<S sid="169" ssid="17">This method obtains precision of 61% and recall 51%.</S>
<S sid="171" ssid="19">In contrast, we use the neighbours lists and WordNet similarity measures to impose a prevalence ranking on the WordNet senses.</S>
<S sid="115" ssid="13">Our automatically acquired predominant sense performs nearly as well as the first sense provided by SemCor, which is very encouraging given that our method only uses raw text, with no manual labelling.</S>
