<S sid="132" ssid="17">Results We first compare our system with Clarke et al. (2010) (henceforth, SEMRESP), which also learns a semantic parser from question-answer pairs.</S>
<S sid="25" ssid="1">We first present a basic version (Section 2.1) of dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which captures the core idea of using trees to represent formal semantics.</S>
 <S sid="45" ssid="21">The logical forms in DCS are called DCS trees, where nodes are labeled with predicates, and edges are labeled with relations.</S>
<S sid="51" ssid="27">It is impossible to represent the semantics of this phrase with just a CSP, so we introduce a new aggregate relation, notated E. Consider a tree hE:ci, whose root is connected to a child c via E. If the denotation of c is a set of values s, the parent&#8217;s denotation is then a singleton set containing s. Formally: Figure 3(a) shows the DCS tree for our running example.</S>

 <S sid="11" ssid="7">Figure 1 shows our probabilistic model: with respect to a world w (database of facts), producing an answer y.</S>
  <S sid="115" ssid="91">After training, given a new utterance x, our system outputs the most likely y, summing out the latent logical form z: argmaxy p&#952;(T)(y  |x, z &#8712; &#732;ZL,&#952;(T)).</S>

<S sid="106" ssid="82">Learning Given a training dataset D containing (x, y) pairs, we define the regularized marginal log-likelihood objective O(&#952;) = E(x,y)ED log p&#952;(JzKw = y  |x, z &#8712; ZL(x)) &#8722; &#955;k&#952;k22, which sums over all DCS trees z that evaluate to the target answer y.</S>
<S sid="167" ssid="52">In DCS, we start with lexical triggers, which are 6 Conclusion more basic than CCG lexical entries.</S>
<S sid="138" ssid="23">Next, we compared our systems (DCS and DCS+) with the state-of-the-art semantic parsers on the full dataset for both GEO and JOBS (see Table 3).</S>
<S sid="40" ssid="16">The CSP has two types of constraints: (i) x &#8712; w(p) for each node x labeled with predicate p &#8712; P; and (ii) xj = yj0 (the j-th component of x must equal the j'-th component of y) for each edge (x, y) labeled with j0j &#8712; R. A solution to the CSP is an assignment of nodes to values that satisfies all the constraints.</S>
