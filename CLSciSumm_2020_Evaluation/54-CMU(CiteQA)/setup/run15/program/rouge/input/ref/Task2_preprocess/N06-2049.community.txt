<S sid ="0">Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">In addition, the latter can be used to balance out-of-vocabulary rates and in-vocabulary rates.</S>
<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.</S>
<S sid ="25" ssid = "3">It is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.</S>
<S sid ="38" ssid = "16">For a character-based IOB tagger, there is only one possibility of re-segmentation.</S><S sid ="39" ssid = "17">However, there are multiple choices for a subword-based IOB tagger.</S>
<S sid ="58" ssid = "36">We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation.</S>
<S sid ="59" ssid = "37">The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation.</S>
<S sid ="66" ssid = "44">A confidence measure threshold, t, was defined for making a decision based on the value.</S>
<S sid ="67" ssid = "45">If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used.</S>
<S sid ="72" ssid = "1">We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections.</S> 
<S sid ="78" ssid = "7">For the dictionary-based approach, we extracted a word list from the training data as the vocabulary.</S><S sid ="79" ssid = "8">Tri- gram LMs were generated using the SRI LM toolkit for disambiguation.</S>
<S sid ="104" ssid = "33">Comparing Table 1 and 2, we found the CRF-modeled IOB tagging yielded better segmentation than the dictionary- based approach.</S>
<S sid ="105" ssid = "34">However, the R-iv rates were getting worse in return for higher R-oov rates.</S>
<S sid ="151" ssid = "1">In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation.</S>
