<S sid="72" ssid="17">In order to avoid inconsistencies, the corpus is annotated in two stages: basic annotation and nfirtellte714.</S>
 <S sid="144" ssid="25">We distinguish five degrees of automation: So far, about 1100 sentences of our corpus have been annotated.</S>
<S sid="14" ssid="4">Corpora annotated with syntactic structures are commonly referred to as trctbank.5.</S>
<S sid="15" ssid="5">Existing treebank annotation schemes exhibit a fairly uniform architecture, as they all have to meet the same basic requirements, namely: Descriptivity: Grammatical phenomena are to be described rather than explained.</S>
  <S sid="36" ssid="26">As for free word order languages, the following features may cause problems: sition between the two poles.</S>
 <S sid="24" ssid="14">The typical treebank architecture is as follows: Structures: A context-free backbone is augmented with trace-filler representations of non-local dependencies.</S>
 <S sid="160" ssid="2">These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme.</S>
 <S sid="151" ssid="32">For evaluation, the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets, one for training (90% of the corpus), the other one for testing (10%).</S>
 <S sid="4" ssid="1">The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks') for stochastic grammar induction.</S>
<S sid="160" ssid="2">These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme.</S>
 <S sid="167" ssid="9">In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created.</S>
<S sid="39" ssid="29">Consider the German sentence (1) daran wird ihn Anna erkennen, &amp;di er weint at-it will him Anna recognise that he cries 'Anna will recognise him at his cry' A sample constituent structure is given below: The fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies, marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes.</S>
<S sid="71" ssid="16">However, there is a trade-off between the granularity of information encoded in the labels and the speed and accuracy of annotation.</S>
