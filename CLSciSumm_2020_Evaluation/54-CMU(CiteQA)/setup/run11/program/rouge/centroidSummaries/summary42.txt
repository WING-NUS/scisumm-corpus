Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey at the bash, told of his ordeal in telegraphic bursts. The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen said at a news conference. The minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the terror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they saw as a slow and even obstructive response. The Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to help transport the injured. The former Goteborg firefighter lost his ears, his eyelids and most of his nose in a gas explosion. The injured toll was lowered slightly to 180, but included seven people who needed treatment at emergency burn centers. Police said the list of injured included Somalis and people from current and former Yugoslavia. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people, including a friend. Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and one other died later.
