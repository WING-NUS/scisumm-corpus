Joakim Nivre and Jens Nilsson in their paper'Pseudo-Projective Dependency Parsing'show that how non-projective dependency parsing can be achieved by combining a data-driven projective parser with special graph transformation techniques. First, the training data for the parser is projectivized by applying a minimal number of lifting operations and encoding information about these lifts in arc labels.When the parser is trained on the transformed data,it will ideally learn not only to construct projective dependency structures but also to assign arc labels that encode information about lifts.The main result is that the combined system can recover non-projective dependencies with a precision sufficient to give a
significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy.
