In this paper the author aims at discussing the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification. Many statistical or machine-learning approaches for natural language problems require a relatively large amount of supervision, in the form of labelled training examples. The task is to learn a function from an input string to its type, which we will assume to be one of the categories Person, Organization, or Location. Supervised methods have been applied quite successfully to the full MUC named-entity task. The algorithm can be viewed as heuristically optimizing an objective function; empirically it is shown to be quite successful in optimizing this criterion. The AdaBoost algorithm was developed for supervised learning. They are currently exploring other methods that employ similar ideas and their formal properties. Future work should also extend the approach to build a complete named entity extractor, a method that pulls proper names from text and then classifies them.
