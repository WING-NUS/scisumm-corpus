Earlier this month, a bloc of 109 lawmakers in the 300-member parliament issued an invitation for Ocalan to visit Greece.
 If the head is dethroned, the rebellion gets a mortal blow, said Cengiz Candar who has been following the Kurdish insurgency for daily Sabah. A Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast faces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder and leader. A Red Cross station was set up at the border to assist those turned away to return to Germany if their residence permits were in order. Calascibetta, imprisoned in Istanbul's Metris jail since his detention in August, was due to be handed over to Swiss police Monday. Ocalan is being tried in absentia there on charges that could bring the death penalty. It was up for the courts to decide Turkey's extradition request, as well as an expected one from Germany, he said. Before leaving, he criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who reportedly said Turkey's extradition request would be refused.
