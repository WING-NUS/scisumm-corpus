The mere fact that everyone is complaining means that the Truth Commission has done its work, he said. One major flaw in the report is the absence of a section accusing F.W.

The fact that they agreed to withdraw creates the definite impression that they specifically concocted a case to involve Mr. 30.

There are probably few subjects that get South Africans more excited than the issue of the Truth Commission and whether it is a worthy cause or a waste of money. The report will be a broad and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when all-race elections ended white minority rule.
