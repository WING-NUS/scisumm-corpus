This paper presents a robust, knowledge-poor approach to resolving pronouns in technical manuals, which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger in 1998.It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences or antecedent indicators.these indicators depend upon a number of salience factors like definiteness,immediate reference etc.this system does not require domain specific knowledge.it shows success rate of 89.7%.it can be applied to different languages other than english.
