Under a scorching sun, the column of rebel reinforcements heading to Kindu sneaked through abandoned roadside hamlets. Rescue workers said there were no survivors from the downed plane, the British Broadcasting Corp. Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said surface-to-air missiles in the arsenal of his Congolese Democratic Coalition had prevented the government from landing aircraft at the airport. A small, grass airstrip 8 kilometers( 5 miles) away from Kalima is just barely long enough for the rebels Russian-built Antonov AN-72 transport aircraft. Among them were former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who took part in a 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda in which more than half a million Tutsis were killed. The rebels have promised to revitalize the economy by reducing taxes to boost investment. The assistance was essential in routing an early rebel offensive in the west that had reached the outskirts of Kinshasa in mid-August. There are unconfirmed reports that troops from Chad and the Sudan are involved in defending Kindu. Today, its decaying buildings, empty shops and crumbling guest houses are home to rebel leaders, soldiers and people displaced by violence.
