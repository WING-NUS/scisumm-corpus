The best way to characterize that is by a comment a legislator made a few years back, when he likened homosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be sent to the packing plant. But they added that they hoped the death would have an impact on legislators around the nation. Shepard was born in Casper and attended elementary school, junior high and several years of high school and college here. Instead, he said, hate crime laws send a clear message that society does not tolerate attacks on minorities. But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use Shepard's death to expand hate rights laws and to curtail freedom of speech. We live in a state where a young man was brutally beaten because he is gay. This basically sends a message that you can't disagree with the political message of homosexual activists. He also said that roughly half of the people who attack homosexuals are male, aged 22 or younger.
