officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid package have said nothing in public about the details of plans for a direct contribution to Brazil. At the time, Clinton argued that the monetary fund should provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial contagion rather than wait for disaster to strike. Cardoso wants to impose tough measures that would slash government spending and impose new taxes to try to halt the slide in Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence. Brazil has lost about dlrs 25 billion in foreign currency reserves since August when Russia defaulted on its debts and sparked a new crisis of confidence in emerging market countries. It resulted from a decline in American exports and a sharp increase in what this country buys from abroad. But the reaction was so strong for a time Congress restricted tapping the fund for international bailouts that Rubin has been extraordinarily cautious ever since. Cardoso needs the governors support not only in influencing the congressional delegations, but also in holding down their own spending.
