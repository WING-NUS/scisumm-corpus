<S sid="25" ssid="1">We first present a basic version (Section 2.1) of dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which captures the core idea of using trees to represent formal semantics.</S>
<S sid="21" ssid="17">The main technical contribution of this work is a new semantic representation, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which is both simple and expressive (Section 2).</S>
    <S sid="148" ssid="33">This bootstrapping behavior occurs naturally: The &#8220;easy&#8221; examples are processed first, where easy is defined by the ability of the current model to generate the correct answer using any tree. with scope variation.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="9">We want to induce latent logical forms z (and parameters 0) given only question-answer pairs (x, y), which is much cheaper to obtain than (x, z) pairs.</S>
<S sid="47" ssid="23">This algorithm is linear in the number of nodes times the size of the denotations.1 Now the dual importance of trees in DCS is clear: We have seen that trees parallel syntactic dependency structure, which will facilitate parsing.</S>
S sid="44" ssid="20">The recurrence is as follows: At each node, we compute the set of tuples v consistent with the predicate at that node (v &#8712; w(p)), and S(x)}, where a set of pairs S is treated as a set-valued function S(x) = {y : (x, y) &#8712; S} with domain S1 = {x : (x, y) &#8712; S}.</S>
<S sid="106" ssid="82">Learning Given a training dataset D containing (x, y) pairs, we define the regularized marginal log-likelihood objective O(&#952;) = E(x,y)ED log p&#952;(JzKw = y  |x, z &#8712; ZL(x)) &#8722; &#955;k&#952;k22, which sums over all DCS trees z that evaluate to the target answer y.</S>
