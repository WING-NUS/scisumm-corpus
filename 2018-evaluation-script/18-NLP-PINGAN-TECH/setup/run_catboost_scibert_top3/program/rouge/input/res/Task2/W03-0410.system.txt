Then accuracy has the standard definition:2 2 is equivalent to the weighted mean precision of the clusters, weighted according to cluster size. We started with a list of all the verbs in the given classes from Levin, removing any verb that did not occur at least 100 times in our corpus (the BNC, described below). 4.2.1 Accuracy We can assign each cluster the class label of the majority of its members. We then describe our clustering methodology, the measures we use to evaluate a clustering, and our experimental results. Following Joanis and Stevenson (2003), for each class, we systematically identified the subset of features 4 These results differ slightly from those reported in Joanis and Stevenson (2003), because of our slight changes in verb sets, discussed in Section 3.2. Of these verbs, 20 from each class were randomly selected to use as training data for our supervised experiments in Joanis and Stevenson (2003). We use the same classes and example verbs as in the supervised experiments of Joanis and Stevenson (2003) to enable a comparison between the performance of the unsupervised and supervised methods. Following Joanis and Stevenson (2003), for each class, we systematically identified the subset of features 4 These results differ slightly from those reported in Joanis and Stevenson (2003), because of our slight changes in verb sets, discussed in Section 3.2. In the next two sections, we present unsupervised and minimally supervised approaches to this problem. Although our motivation is verb class discovery, we perform our experiments
