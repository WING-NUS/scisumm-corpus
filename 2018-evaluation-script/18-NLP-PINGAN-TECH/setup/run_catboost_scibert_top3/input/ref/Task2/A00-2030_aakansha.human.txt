The paper reports adapting a lexicalized,probabilistic context-free parser with head rules to information extraction.the approach is evaluated on two tasks:The Template Element (TE) task which identifies elements like organizations,persons, locations, and some artifacts and The Template Relations (TR) task which involves identifying instances of relations between elements in the text.TR builds on TE in that TR reports binary relations between elements of TE.The model can limit the propagation of errors by making all decisions jointly. For this reason,The authors designed an integrated model in which tagging, name finding, parsing, and semantic interpretation decisions all have the opportunity to mutually influence each other.The integrated model represents syntax and semantics jointly using augmented parse trees.In these trees, the standard TREEBANK structures are augmented to convey semantic information, that is, entities and relations.The system finished in second place among all entrants.Disabling the cross-sentence model entirely reduced overall F-Score by 2 points.
