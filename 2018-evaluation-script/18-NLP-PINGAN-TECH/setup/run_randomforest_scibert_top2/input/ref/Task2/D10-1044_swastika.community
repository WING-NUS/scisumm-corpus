<S sid="9" ssid="6">In this paper we study the problem of using a parallel corpus from a background domain (OUT) to improve performance on a target domain (IN) for which a smaller amount of parallel training material&#8212;though adequate for reasonable performance&#8212;is also available.</S>
<S sid="62" ssid="26">To approximate these baselines, we implemented a very simple sentence selection algorithm in which parallel sentence pairs from OUT are ranked by the perplexity of their target half according to the IN language model.</S>
<S sid="71" ssid="8">Finally, we incorporate the instance-weighting model into a general linear combination, and learn weights and mixing parameters simultaneously. where c&#955;(s, t) is a modified count for pair (s, t) in OUT, u(s|t) is a prior distribution, and y is a prior weight.</S>
<S sid="96" ssid="33">We used it to score all phrase pairs in the OUT table, in order to provide a feature for the instance-weighting model.</S>
<S sid="144" ssid="1">In this paper we have proposed an approach for instance-weighting phrase pairs in an out-of-domain corpus in order to improve in-domain performance.</S>
<S sid="45" ssid="9">An easy way to achieve this is to put the domain-specific LMs and TMs into the top-level log-linear model and learn optimal weights with MERT (Och, 2003).</S>
<S sid="75" ssid="12">However, it is robust, efficient, and easy to implement.4 To perform the maximization in (7), we used the popular L-BFGS algorithm (Liu and Nocedal, 1989), which requires gradient information.</S>
<S sid="22" ssid="19">Within this framework, we use features intended to capture degree of generality, including the output from an SVM classifier that uses the intersection between IN and OUT as positive examples.</S>
  <S sid="42" ssid="6">The natural baseline approach is to concatenate data from IN and OUT.</S>
