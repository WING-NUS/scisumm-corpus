McCarthy et all presented work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity package to find predominant noun senses from two domain specific corpora automatically. The acquired predominant senses gave a of 64% on the nouns of the 2 English all-words task, a very promising result given that their method did not require any hand-tagged text. They had devised a method that used raw corpus data to automatically find a predominant sense for nouns in WordNet and used an automatically acquired thesaurus and a WordNet Similarity measure. They were evaluated against the hand-tagged resources SemCor and the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task giving them a WSD precision of 64% on an all-nouns task. In many cases, the sense ranking provided in SemCor differed to that obtained automatically because they used the BNC to produce their thesaurus.
