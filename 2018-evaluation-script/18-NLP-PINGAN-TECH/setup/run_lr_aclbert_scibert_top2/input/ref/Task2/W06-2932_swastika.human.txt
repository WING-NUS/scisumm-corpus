McDonald et all presented a two-stage multilingual pendency parser and evaluate it on 13 diverse languages. The first stage based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira was augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages. The second stage took the output from the first and labels all the edges in the dependency graph with appropriate syntactic categories using a globally trained sequence classifier over components of the graph. They reported results on the CoNLL-X shared task data sets and presented an error analysis and presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of theirs generalized well to languages other than English.
