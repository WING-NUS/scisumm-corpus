We present a two-stage multilingual dependency
parser and evaluate it on 13
diverse languages. The first stage is
based on the unlabeled dependency parsing
models described by McDonald and
Pereira (2006) augmented with morphological
features for a subset of the languages.
The second stage takes the output
from the first and labels all the edges
in the dependency graph with appropriate
syntactic categories using a globally
trained sequence classifier over components
of the graph. We report results on
the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et
al., 2006) data sets and present an error
analysis.
