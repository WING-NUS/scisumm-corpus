Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training
a semantic parser to perform this mapping
typically requires the costly annotation of the
target logical forms. In this paper, we learn
to map questions to answers via latent logical
forms, which are induced automatically
from question-answer pairs. In tackling this
challenging learning problem, we introduce a
new semantic representation which highlights
a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient
evaluation of logical forms. On two standard
semantic parsing benchmarks (GEO and
JOBS), our system obtains the highest published
accuracies, despite requiring no annotated
logical forms.
