The arrangement appears to have resulted from a plea bargain in which the source is cooperating in hopes of receiving a lesser sentence. Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction between attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking a group of people who command a terrorist organization. There is no indication that the source has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete. Prosecutors assert that he rented the villa where the bomb was assembled and surveyed the embassy's security precautions. The government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in U.S. In one recent filing, they said their case will in part be based on the testimony of the confidential source, suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of bin Laden or his associates.
