Diana McCarthy & Rob Koeling & Julie Weeds & John Carroll in their paper 'Finding Predominant Word Senses in Untagged Text'present a method that uses raw corpus data to automatically find a predominant sense for nouns in WordNet.ey chose documents from the SPORTS domain and a the FINANCE domain.they use an automatically acquired thesaurus and a WordNet Similarity measure.we use the SENSEVAL -2 all-words data (Palmer et al.,2001).This is a hand-tagged test suite of 5,000 words of running text from three articles from the Penn Treebank II. The automatically acquired predominant senses were evaluated against the hand-tagged resources SemCor and the SENSEVAL -2 English all-words task giving us a WSD precision of 64% on an all-nouns task.
