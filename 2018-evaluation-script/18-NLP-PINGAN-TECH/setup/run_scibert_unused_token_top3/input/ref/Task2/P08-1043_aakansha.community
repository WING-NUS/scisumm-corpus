<S sid="94" ssid="26">Our use of an unweighted lattice reflects our belief that all the segmentations of the given input sentence are a-priori equally likely; the only reason to prefer one segmentation over the another is due to the overall syntactic context which is modeled via the PCFG derivations.</S>
S sid="4" ssid="4">Using a treebank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling technique our model outperforms previous pipelined, integrated or factorized systems for Hebrew morphological and syntactic processing, yielding an error reduction of 12% over the best published results so far.</S>
<S sid="19" ssid="15">Here we push the single-framework conjecture across the board and present a single model that performs morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation in a fully generative framework.</S>
"<S sid=""69"" ssid=""1"">We represent all morphological analyses of a given utterance using a lattice structure.</S>
    <S sid=""70"" ssid=""2"">Each lattice arc corresponds to a segment and its corresponding PoS tag, and a path through the lattice corresponds to a specific morphological segmentation of the utterance.</S>"
<S sid="85" ssid="17">The Input The set of analyses for a token is thus represented as a lattice in which every arc corresponds to a specific lexeme l, as shown in Figure 1.</S>
<S sid="21" ssid="17">Morphological segmentation decisions in our model are delegated to a lexeme-based PCFG and we show that using a simple treebank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling our model outperforms (Tsarfaty, 2006) and (Cohen and Smith, 2007) on the joint task and achieves state-of-the-art results on a par with current respective standalone models.2</S>
"<S sid=""133"" ssid=""11"">Morphological Analyzer Ideally, we would use an of-the-shelf morphological analyzer for mapping each input token to its possible analyses.</S>
    <S sid=""134"" ssid=""12"">Such resources exist for Hebrew (Itai et al., 2006), but unfortunately use a tagging scheme which is incompatible with the one of the Hebrew Treebank.s For this reason, we use a data-driven morphological analyzer derived from the training 	similar to (Cohen and Smith, 2007).</S>"
<S sid="155" ssid="33">Evaluation We use 8 different measures to evaluate the performance of our system on the joint disambiguation task.</S>
