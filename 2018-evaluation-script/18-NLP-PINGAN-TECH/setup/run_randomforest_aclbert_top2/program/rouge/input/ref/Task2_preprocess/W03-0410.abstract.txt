<S sid ="0">Semi-supervised Verb Class Discovery Using Noisy Features</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">We cluster verbs into lexical semantic classes, using a general set of noisy features that capture syntactic and semantic properties of the verbs.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">The feature set was previously shown to work well in a supervised learning setting, using known English verb classes.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">In moving to a scenario of verb class discovery, using clustering, we face the problem of having a large number of irrelevant features for a particular clustering task.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">We investigate various approaches to feature selection, using both unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, comparing the results to subsets of features manually chosen according to linguistic properties.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">We find that the unsupervised method we tried cannot be consistently applied to our data.</S>
<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">However, the semi- supervised approach (using a seed set of sample verbs) overall outperforms not only the full set of features, but the hand-selected features as well.</S>
