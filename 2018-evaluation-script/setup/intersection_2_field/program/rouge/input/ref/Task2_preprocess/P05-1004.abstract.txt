<S sid="0">Supersense Tagging of Unknown Nouns using Semantic Similarity</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is a significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">Supersense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organise their manual insertion into WORDNET.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present a tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">We describe an unsupervised approach, based on vector-space similarity, which does not require annotated examples but significantly outperforms their tagger.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity.</S>
