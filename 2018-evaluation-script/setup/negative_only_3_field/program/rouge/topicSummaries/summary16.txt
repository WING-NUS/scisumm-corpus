Israel has also instructed its army to limit military maneuvers along its border with Syria to avoid giving any impression that Israel is poised to act. Turkey in particular ... repeatedly dynamites every effort for the creation of a climate of regional stability. But several military and civilian leaders here have said that if diplomacy fails, the military would be charged with solving the issue. I declare to the world that we retain our right to counter Syria, which has not given up its hostile attitude despite all our warnings and peaceful approaches, he said. As we live in this region of the world ... we have to strive for good friendly relations and cooperation.
 Turkish troops have reportedly massed on the frontier with Syria, while Ankara has indicated its readiness for cross-border raids to eradicate what it claims are guerrilla bases harboring Kurdish rebels. There have been unconfirmed reports of Turkish jets violating Syria airspace near the border. Hariri said Turkey's military moves were the product of its newly forged military alliance with Israel.
