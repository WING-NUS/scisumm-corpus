<S sid="118" ssid="3">In the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS's) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows.</S>
<S sid="149" ssid="34">We can obtain a letter equivalent CFL defined by a CFG in which the for each rule as above, we have the production A &#8212;* A1 Anup where tk (up) = cp.</S>
   <S sid="2" ssid="2">In considering the relationship between formalisms, we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees. find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by Context-Free Grammars On the basis of this observation, we describe a class of formalisms which we call Linear Context- Free Rewriting Systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages.</S>
<S sid="222" ssid="28">However, in order to capture the properties of various grammatical systems under consideration, our notation is more restrictive that ILFP, which was designed as a general logical notation to characterize the complete class of languages that are recognizable in polynomial time.</S>
<S sid="119" ssid="4">In defining LCFRS's, we hope to generalize the definition of CFG's to formalisms manipulating any structure, e.g. strings, trees, or graphs.</S>
<S sid="207" ssid="13">We outlined the definition of a family of constrained grammatical formalisms, called Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems.</S>
<S sid="19" ssid="4">It can be easily shown from Thatcher's result that the path set of every local set is a regular set.</S>
