<S sid="0">Investigating regular sense extensions based on intersective Levin classes</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">We see verb classes as the key to making gen­ eralizations about regular extensions of mean­ ing.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Current approaches to English classifica­ tion, Levin classes and WordNet, have limita­ tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">We present a refinement of Levin classes, intersec­ tive sets, which are a more fine-grained clas­ sification and have more coherent sets of syn­ tactic frames and associated semantic compo­ nents.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">We have preliminary indications that the membership of our intersective sets will be more compatible with WordNet than the orig­ inal Levin classes.</S>
<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">We also have begun to ex­ amine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties.</S>
