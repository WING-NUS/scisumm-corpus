<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">In this paper we describe a search procedure for statistical machine translation (MT) based on dynamic programming (DP) Starting from a DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem we present a novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an e√Ücient search algorithm A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task (GermanEnglish 8000-word vocabulary) which is a limited-domain spoken-language task</S>
