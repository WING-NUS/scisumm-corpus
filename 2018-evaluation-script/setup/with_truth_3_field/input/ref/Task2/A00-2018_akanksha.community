<S sid="5" ssid="1">We present a new parser for parsing down to Penn tree-bank style parse trees [16] that achieves 90.1% average precision/recall for sentences of length &lt; 40, and 89.5% for sentences of length &lt; 100, when trained and tested on the previously established [5,9,10,15,17] &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; sections of the Wall Street Journal tree-bank.</S>

"<S sid=""48"" ssid=""17"">Maximum-entropy models have two benefits for a parser builder.</S>
    <S sid=""49"" ssid=""18"">First, as already implicit in our discussion, factoring the probability computation into a sequence of values corresponding to various &amp;quot;features&amp;quot; suggests that the probability model should be easily changeable &#8212; just change the set of features used.</S>
    <S sid=""51"" ssid=""20"">Second, and this is a point we have not yet mentioned, the features used in these models need have no particular independence of one another.</S>"

    <S sid=""92"" ssid=""3"">For runs with the generative model based upon Markov grammar statistics, the first pass uses the same statistics, but conditioned only on standard PCFG information.</S>
    <S sid=""93"" ssid=""4"">This allows the second pass to see expansions not present in the training corpus.</S>
    <S sid=""94"" ssid=""5"">We use the gathered statistics for all observed words, even those with very low counts, though obviously our deleted interpolation smoothing gives less emphasis to observed probabilities for rare words.</S>"

"<S sid=""38"" ssid=""7"">To compute a probability in a log-linear model one first defines a set of &amp;quot;features&amp;quot;, functions from the space of configurations over which one is trying to compute probabilities to integers that denote the number of times some pattern occurs in the input.</S>
    <S sid=""39"" ssid=""8"">In our work we assume that any feature can occur at most once, so features are boolean-valued: 0 if the pattern does not occur, 1 if it does.</S>
    <S sid=""40"" ssid=""9"">In the parser we further assume that features are chosen from certain feature schemata and that every feature is a boolean conjunction of sub-features.</S>"
<S sid="174" ssid="1">We have presented a lexicalized Markov grammar parsing model that achieves (using the now standard training/testing/development sections of the Penn treebank) an average precision/recall of 91.1% on sentences of length &lt; 40 and 89.5% on sentences of length &lt; 100.</S>
<S sid="85" ssid="54">As partition-function calculation is typically the major on-line computational problem for maximum-entropy models, this simplifies the model significantly.</S>
<S sid="63" ssid="32">As we discuss in more detail in Section 5, several different features in the context surrounding c are useful to include in H: the label, head pre-terminal and head of the parent of c (denoted as lp, tp, hp), the label of c's left sibling (lb for &amp;quot;before&amp;quot;), and the label of the grandparent of c (la).</S><S sid="143" ssid="34">The first is simply that if we first guess the pre-terminal, when we go to guess the head the first thing we can condition upon is the pre-terminal, i.e., we compute p(h I t).</S><S sid="146" ssid="37">The second major reason why first guessing the pre-terminal makes so much difference is that it can be used when backing off the lexical head in computing the probability of the rule expansion.</S>
<S sid="78" ssid="47">With some prior knowledge, non-zero values can greatly speed up this process because fewer iterations are required for convergence.</S>                                        <S sid="79" ssid="48">We comment on this because in our example we can substantially speed up the process by choosing values picked so that, when the maximum-entropy equation is expressed in the form of Equation 4, the gi have as their initial values the values of the corresponding terms in Equation 7.</S>
