<S sid="86" ssid="8">Unlabeled accuracy for all verbs increases from 71% to 73% and for all conjunctions from 71% to 74%.</S>
<S sid="79" ssid="1">Although overall unlabeled accuracy is 86%, most verbs and some conjunctions attach to their head words with much lower accuracy: 69% for main verbs, 75% for the verb ser, and 65% for coordinating conjunctions.</S>
<S sid="22" ssid="4">An exact projective and an approximate non-projective parsing algorithm are presented, since it is shown that nonprojective dependency parsing becomes NP-hard when features are extended beyond a single edge.</S>
<S sid="54" ssid="2">Based on performance from a held-out section of the training data, we used non-projective parsing algorithms for Czech, Danish, Dutch, German, Japanese, Portuguese and Slovene, and projective parsing algorithms for Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.</S>
<S sid="12" ssid="8">In this paper we describe a two-stage discriminative parsing approach consisting of an unlabeled parser and a subsequent edge labeler.</S>

<S sid="41" ssid="10">To model this we treat the labeling of the edges (i, j1), ... , (i, jM) as a sequence labeling problem, We use a first-order Markov factorization of the score s(l(i,jm), l(i,jm&#65533;1), i, y, x) in which each factor is the score of labeling the adjacent edges (i, jm) and (i, jm&#8722;1) in the tree y.</S>
<S sid="24" ssid="6">Its power lies in the ability to define a rich set of features over parsing decisions, as well as surface level features relative to these decisions.</S>
<S sid="43" ssid="12">For score functions, we use simple dot products between high dimensional feature representations and a weight vector Assuming we have an appropriate feature representation, we can find the highest scoring label sequence with Viterbi&#8217;s algorithm.</S>
