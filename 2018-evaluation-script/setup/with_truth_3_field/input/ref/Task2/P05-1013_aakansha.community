<S sid="86" ssid="13">As expected, the most informative encoding, Head+Path, gives the highest accuracy with over 99% of all non-projective arcs being recovered correctly in both data sets.</S>
S sid="36" ssid="7">As observed by Kahane et al. (1998), any (nonprojective) dependency graph can be transformed into a projective one by a lifting operation, which replaces each non-projective arc wj wk by a projective arc wi &#8212;* wk such that wi &#8212;*&#8727; wj holds in the original graph.</S>

<S sid="23" ssid="19">By applying an inverse transformation to the output of the parser, arcs with non-standard labels can be lowered to their proper place in the dependency graph, giving rise 1The dependency graph has been modified to make the final period a dependent of the main verb instead of being a dependent of a special root node for the sentence. to non-projective structures.</S>

<S sid="49" ssid="20">The baseline simply retains the original labels for all arcs, regardless of whether they have been lifted or not, and the number of distinct labels is therefore simply the number n of distinct dependency types.2 In the first encoding scheme, called Head, we use a new label d&#8593;h for each lifted arc, where d is the dependency relation between the syntactic head and the dependent in the non-projective representation, and h is the dependency relation that the syntactic head has to its own head in the underlying structure.</S>
<S sid="14" ssid="10">While the proportion of sentences containing non-projective dependencies is often 15&#8211;25%, the total proportion of non-projective arcs is normally only 1&#8211;2%.</S>
