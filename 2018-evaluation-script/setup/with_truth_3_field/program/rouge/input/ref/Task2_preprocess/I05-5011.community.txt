<S sid ="0">Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs</S>
<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâ€™s query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâ€™s question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question.</S>
<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks.</S><S sid ="20" ssid = "20">In order to create an IE system for a new domain, one has to spend a long time to create the knowledge.</S>
<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.</S><S sid ="40" ssid = "16">The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004].</S>
<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications.</S>
<S sid ="29" ssid = "5">For each pair we also record the context, i.e. the phrase between the two NEs (Step1).</S><S sid ="30" ssid = "6">Next, for each pair of NE categories, we collect all the contexts and find the keywords which are topical for that NE category pair.</S>
<S sid ="32" ssid = "8">Hereafter, each pair of NE categories will be called a domain; e.g. the “Company – Company” domain, which we will call CC- domain (Step 2).</S>
<S sid ="33" ssid = "9">For each domain, phrases which contain the same keyword are gathered to build a set of phrases (Step 3).</S>
<S sid ="38" ssid = "14">Extract NE instance pairs with contexts First, we extract NE pair instances with their context from the corpus.</S>
<S sid ="40" ssid = "16">The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004].</S>
<S sid ="41" ssid = "17">These 140 NE categories are designed by extending MUC’s 7 NE categories with finer sub-categories (such as Company, Institute, and Political Party for Organization; and Country, Province, and City for Location) and adding some new types of NE categories (Position Title, Product, Event, and Natural Object).</S>
<S sid ="62" ssid = "38">Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword.</S><S sid ="65" ssid = "41">At this step, we will try to link those sets, and put them into a single cluster.</S>
<S sid ="110" ssid = "31">Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances.</S>
<S sid ="197" ssid = "24">Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases.</S>
<S sid ="164" ssid = "11">There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora.</S>
<S sid ="167" ssid = "14">Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01].</S>
<S sid ="203" ssid = "30">While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system.</S>
<S sid ="204" ssid = "1">We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.</S
