<S sid ="0">Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">Automatic paraphrase discovery is an important but challenging task.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">We propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus, without requiring any seed phrase or other cue.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">We focus on phrases which connect two Named Entities (NEs), and proceed in two stages.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">The first stage identifies a keyword in each phrase and joins phrases with the same keyword into sets.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">The second stage links sets which involve the same pairs of individual NEs.</S>
<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">A total of 13,976 phrases were grouped.</S>
<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">The accuracy of the sets in representing paraphrase ranged from 73% to 99%, depending on the NE categories and set sizes; the accuracy of the links for two evaluated domains was 73% and 86%.</S>
