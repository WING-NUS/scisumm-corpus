<S sid="0">Robust pronoun resolution with limited knowledge</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">One of the disadvantages of developing a knowledge­ based system, however, is that it is a very labour­ intensive and time-consuming task.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">This paper pres­ ents a robust, knowledge-poor approach to resolving pronouns in technical manuals, which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Input is checked against agreement and for a number of antecedent indicators.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Candidates are assigned scores by each indicator and the candidate with the highest score is returned as the antecedent.</S>
<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Evaluation reports a success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data.</S>
<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">In addition, preliminary experiments show that the approach can be success­ fully adapted for other languages with minimum modifications.</S>
