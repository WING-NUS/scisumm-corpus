These aligned document pairs could then be fed into standard machine translation systems as training data.In this paper  we use two polylingual corpora to answer various critical questions related to polylingual topic models.We dropped all articles in non-English languages that did not link to an English article.For T = 800  the top English and Spanish words in 448 topics were exact translations of one another.Finally  for each pair of languages (“query” and “target”) we calculate the difference between the topic distribution for each held-out document in the query language and the topic distribution for each held-out document in the target language.Figure 2 shows the most probable words in all languages for four example topics  from PLTM with 400 topics.We use both Jensen-Shannon divergence and cosine distance.Outside of the field of topic modeling  Kawaba et al. (Kawaba et al.  2008) use a Wikipedia-based model to perform sentiment analysis of blog posts.The internet makes it possible for people all over the world to access documents from different cultures  but readers will not be fluent in this wide variety of languages.The first topic contains words relating to the European Central Bank.This is unlike LDA  in which each document is assumed to have its own document-specific distribution over topics.However  they evaluate their model on only two languages (English and Chinese)  and do not use the model to detect differences between languages.As with EuroParl  we can calculate the JensenShannon divergence between pairs of documents within a comparable document tuple.Meanwhile  interest in actors and actresses (center) is consistent across all languages.This result is important: informally  we have found that increasing the granularity of topics correlates strongly with user perceptions of the utility of a topic model.Results vary by language.It is important to note that the length of documents matters.English and the Romance languages use only singular and plural versions of “objective.” The other Germanic languages include compound words  while Greek and Finnish are dominated by inflected variants of the same lexical item.These tasks can either be accomplished by averaging over samples of Φ1  .Second  because comparable texts may not use exactly the same topics  it becomes crucially important to be able to characterize differences in topic prevalence at the document level (do different languages have different perspectives on the same article?) and at the language-wide level (which topics do particular languages focus on?).We do not consider multi-word terms.We preprocessed the data by removing tables  references  images and info-boxes.Rather  these results are intended as a quantitative analysis of the difference between the two models.Anew document tuple w = (w1  ...   wL) is generated by first drawing a tuple-specific topic distribution from an asymmetric Dirichlet prior with concentration parameter α and base measure m: Then  for each language l  a latent topic assignment is drawn for each token in that language: Finally  the observed tokens are themselves drawn using the language-specific topic parameters: wl ∼ P(wl  |zl Φl) = 11n φlwl |zl .The second corpus  Wikipedia articles in twelve languages  contains sets of documents that are not translations of one another  but are very likely to be about similar concepts.We compute histograms of these maximum topic probabilities for T ∈ {50 100  200  400  800}.Interestingly  we find that almost all languages in our corpus  including several pairs that have historically been in conflict  show average JS divergences of between approximately 0.08 and 0.12 for T = 400  consistent with our findings for EuroParl translations.The probability of previously unseen held-out document tuples given these estimates can then be computed.For efficiency  we truncated each article to the nearest word after 1000 characters and dropped the 50 most common word types in each language..At p = 0.01 (1% “glue” documents)  German and French both include words relating to Russia  while the English and Italian word distributions appear locally consistent but unrelated to Russia.Topic models are a useful tool for analyzing large text collections  but have previously been applied in only monolingual  or at most bilingual  contexts.In this paper  we present the polylingual topic model (PLTM).Although we find that if Wikipedia contains an article on a particular subject in some language  the article will tend to be topically similar to the articles about that subject in other languages  we also find that across the whole collection different languages emphasize topics to different extents.  ΦL and αm from P(Φ1  ...   ΦL  αm  |W'  β) or by evaluating a point estimate.To answer this question  we compute the posterior probability of each topic in each tuple under the trained model.We take a simpler approach that is more suitable for topically similar document tuples (where documents are not direct translations of one another) in more than two languages.We evaluate sets of high-probability words in each topic and multilingual “synsets” by comparing them to entries in human-constructed bilingual dictionaries  as done by Haghighi et al. (2008)..The remaining collection consists of over 121 million words.(Interestingly  all languages except Greek and Finnish use closely related words for “youth” or “young” in a separate topic.)A recent extended abstract  developed concurrently by Ni et al. (Ni et al.  2009)  discusses a multilingual topic model similar to the one presented here.We employ a set of direct translations  the EuroParl corpus  to evaluate whether PLTM can accurately infer topics when documents genuinely contain the same content.We downloaded XML copies of all Wikipedia articles in twelve different languages: Welsh  German  Greek  English  Farsi  Finnish  French  Hebrew  Italian  Polish  Russian and Turkish.PLTM topics therefore have a higher granularity – i.e.  they are more specific.Analytically calculating the probability of a set of held-out document tuples given Φ1  ...   ΦL and αm is intractable  due to the summation over an exponential number of topic assignments for these held-out documents.We expect that simple analysis of topic assignments for sequential words would yield such collocations  but we leave this for future work.As the number of topics increases  greater variability in topic distributions causes divergence to increase.In this case  we can be confident that the topic distribution is genuinely shared across all languages.We analyzed the characteristics of PLTM in comparison to monolingual LDA  and demonstrated that it is possible to discover aligned topics.Our first set of experiments focuses on document tuples that are known to consist of direct translations.Such analysis could be significant in tracking international research trends  where language barriers slow the transfer of ideas.They also provide little analysis of the differences between polylingual and single-language topic models.
