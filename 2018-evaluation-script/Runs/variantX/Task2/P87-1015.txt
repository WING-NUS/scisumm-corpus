In addition to the tapes required to store the indices  M requires one work tape for splitting the substrings.As suggested in Section 4.3.2  a derivation with independent paths can be divided into subcomputations with limited sharing of information.To do this  the x's and y's are stored in the next 2ni + 2n2 tapes  and M goes to a universal state.Pumping t2 will change only one branch and leave the other branch unaffected.Thus  the ATM has no more than 6km&quot; + 1 work tapes  where km&quot; is the maximum number of substrings spanned by a derived structure.((fii  Q2  Pa)   —■ (01  i32  03)   e) (02 e) Oa  en) The path complexity of the tee set generated by a MCTAG is not necessarily context-free.An IG can be viewed as a CFG in which each nonterminal is associated with a stack.The string pumping lemma for CFG's (uvwxy-theorem) can be seen as a corollary of this lemma. from this pumping lemma: a single path can be pumped independently.Bresnan  Kaplan  Peters  and Zaenen (1982) argue that these structures are needed to describe crossed-serial dependencies in Dutch subordinate clauses.0n0'i'i0'2&quot;bin242bn I n = 711 + n2 } On the other hand  no linguistic use is made of this general form of composition and Steedman (personal communication) and Steedman (1986) argues that a more limited definition of composition is more natural.We now turn our attention to the recognition of string languages generated by these formalisms (LCFRL's).The edge from the root to the subtree for the derivation of 7i is labeled by the address ni.These two restrictions impose the constraint that the result of composing any two structures should be a structure whose &quot;size&quot; is the sum of its constituents plus some constant For example  the operation 4  discussed in the case of CFG's (in Section 4.1) adds the constant equal to the sum of the length of the strings VI  un+r• Since we are considering formalisms with arbitrary structures it is difficult to precisely specify all of the restrictions on the composition operations that we believe would appropriately generalize the concatenation operation for the particular structures used by the formalism.A TAG consists of a finite set of elementary trees that are either initial trees or auxiliary trees.In this section for the purposes of showing that polynomial time recognition is possible  we make the additional restriction that the contribution of a derived structure to the input string can be specified by a bounded sequence of substrings of the input.These systems are similar to those described by Pollard (1984) as Generalized Context-Free Grammars (GCFG's)..t The path set of tree sets at level k +1 have the complexity of the string language of level k. The independence of paths in a tree set appears to be an important property.As a result  CFG's can not provide the structural descriptions in which there are nested dependencies between symbols labelling a path.We can give a tree pumping lemma for TAG's by adapting the uvwxy-theorem for CFL's since the tree sets of TAG's have independent and context-free paths.The property of semilinearity is concerned only with the occurrence of symbols in strings and not their order.Since each zi is a contiguous substring of the input (say ai )  and no two substrings overlap  we can represent zi by the pair of integers (i2  i2).Each production can push or pop symbols on the stack as can be seen in the following productions that generate tree of the form shown in Figure 4b.Our goal is to define a class of formal systems  and show that any member of this class will possess certain attractive properties.The importance of this property becomes clear in contrasting theories underlying GPSG (Gazdar  Klein  Pulluna  and Sag  1985)  and GB (as described by Berwick  1984) with those underlying LFG and FUG.When 7' is adjoined at ?I in the tree 7 we obtain a tree v&quot;.First  any grammar must involve a finite number of elementary structures  composed using a finite number of composition operations.It can be easily shown from Thatcher's result that the path set of every local set is a regular set.We can show that languages generated by LCFRS's are semilinear as long as the composition operation does not remove any terminal symbols from its arguments.Thus  for example  one successor process will be have M to be in the existential state qa with the indices encoding xi     xn  in the first 2n i tapes.In the remainder of the paper  we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS's) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows.Hence  trees shown in Figure 8 can not be generated by any MCTAG (but can be generated by an IG) because the number of pairs of dependent paths grows with n. Since the derivation tees of TAG's  MCTAG's  and HG's are local sets  the choice of the structure used at each point in a derivation in these systems does not depend on the context at that point within the derivation.A tree set may be said to have dependencies between paths if some &quot;appropriate&quot; subset can be shown to have dependent paths as defined above.Formalisms such as the restricted indexed grammars (Gazdar  1985) and members of the hierarchy of grammatical systems given by Weir (1987) have independent paths  but more complex path sets.Thatcher (1973) describes a tee pumping lemma for recognizable sets related to the string pumping lemma for regular sets.We are very grateful to Tony Kroc.h  Michael Pails  Sunil Shende  and Mark Steedman for valuable discussions. formalisms.It can be seen that M performs a top-down recognition of the input al ... nin logspace.Each spawned process must check if xi     xn  and   yn  can be derived from B and C  respectively.We outlined the definition of a family of constrained grammatical formalisms  called Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems.The productions of HG's are very similar to those of CFG's except that the operation used must be made explicit.We define an ATM  M  recognizing a language generated by a grammar  G  having the properties discussed in Section 43.CFG's  TAG's  MCTAG's and HG's are all members of this class since they satisfy these restrictions.Thus  the derivation trees for TAG's have the same structure as local sets.This class of formalisms have the properties that their derivation trees are local sets  and manipulate objects  using a finite number of composition operations that use a finite number of symbols.TAG's can be shown to be equivalent to this restricted system.In TAG's the elementary tree and addresses where adjunction takes place are used to instantiate the operation.The semilinearity of Tree Adjoining Languages (TAL's)  MCTAL's  and Head Languages (HL's) can be proved using this property  with suitable restrictions on the composition operations.Although embedding this version of LCFRS's in the framework of ILFP developed by Rounds (1985) is straightforward  our motivation was to capture properties shared by a family of grammatical systems and generalize them defining a class of related formalisms.We define the path set of a tree 1 as the set of strings that label a path from the root to frontier of 7.For example  Gazdar (1985) discusses the applicability of Indexed Grammars (IG's) to Natural Language in terms of the structural descriptions assigned; and Berwick (1984) discusses the strong generative capacity of Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) and Government and Bindings grammars (GB).We characterize a class of formalisms that have this property in Section 4.This kind of dependency arises from the use of the composition operation to compose two arbitrarily large categories.For rules p : A fpo such that fp is constant function  giving an elementary structure  fp is defined such that fp() = (Si ... xi() where each z is a constant string.Thus  as in CFG's  at any point in the derivation  the set of structures that can be applied is determined only by a finite set of rules encapsulated by the grammar.Thus  the length of any string in L is a linear combination of the length of strings in some fixed finite subset of L  and thus L is said to have the constant growth property.We can represent any derived tree of a TAG by the two substrings that appear in its frontier  and then define how the adjunction operation concatenates the substrings.Giving a recognition algorithm for LCFRL's involves describing the substrings of the input that are spanned by the structures derived by the LCFRS's and how the composition operation combines these substrings.
