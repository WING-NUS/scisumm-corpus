The problem of &quot;noise&quot; items that do not fall into any of the three categories also needs to be addressed.The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster  Laird and Rubin 77) is a common approach for unsupervised training; in this section we describe its application to the named entity problem.Note that in our formalism a weakhypothesis can abstain.In the next section we present an alternative approach that builds two classifiers while attempting to satisfy the above constraints as much as possible.For example  take ...  says Maury Cooper  a vice president at S.&P.In the appositive case  the contextual predictor was the head of the modifying appositive (president in the Maury Cooper example); in the second case  the contextual predictor was the preposition together with the noun it modifies (plant_in in the Georgia example).(Blum and Mitchell 98) give an example that illustrates just how powerful the second constraint can be.
