While in the first phase each annotator has to annotate structures as well as categories and functions  the refinement call be done separately for each representation level.3 shows the representation of the sentence: (6) sic wurde von preuBischen Truppen besetzt she was by Prussian troops occupied und 1887 dem preuliischen Staat angegliedert and 1887 to-the Prussian state incorporated 'it was occupied by Prussian troops and incorporated into Prussia in 1887' The category of the coordination is labeled CVP here  where C stands for coordination  and VP for the actual category.Figure 1 shows a screen dump of the tool.Consider the German sentence (1) daran wird ihn Anna erkennen  &di er weint at-it will him Anna recognise that he cries 'Anna will recognise him at his cry' A sample constituent structure is given below: The fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies  marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes.Consider (qui verbs where the subject of the infinitival VP is not realised syntactically  but co-referent with the subject or object. of the matrix equi verb: (3) er bat mich zu kommen he asked me to come (mich is the understood subject. of kommt n).A similar convention ha.s been adopted for constructions in which scope ambiguities have syntactic effects but a one-to-one correspondence between scope and attachment. does not seem reasonable  cf. focus particles such as only or also.Separable verb prefixes are labeled SVP.Thus the context-free constituent backbone plays a pivotal role in the annotation scheme.Since a precise structural description of non-constituent coordination would require a. rich inventory of incomplete phrase types  we have agreed on a sort of unde.rspe.cified representations: the coordinated units are assigned structures in which missing lexical material is not represented at the level of primary links.We distinguish the following levels of representation: 'A context-free constituent backbone can still be recovered from the surface string and argument structure by reattaching 'extracted' structures to a higher node.Syntactic categories  expressed by category labels assigned to non-terminal nodes and by part-of-speech tags assigned to terminals.Morphological information: Another set of labels represents morphological information.A formalism complying with these requirements is described in section 3.An Annotation Scheme for Free Word Order Languages(Marcus et al.  1994).For evaluation  the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets  one for training (90% of the corpus)  the other one for testing (10%).Furthermore  the required theory-independence means that the form of syntactic trees should not reflect theory-specific assumptions  e.g. every syntactic structure has a unique head.Fig.The tree resembles traditional constituent structures.2.Headed and non-headed structures are distinguished by the presence or absence of a branch labeled HD.In particular  we focus on several methodological issues concerning the annotation of non-configurational languages.An explicit coordinating conjunction need not be present.(Bies et al.  1995)  (Sampson  1995)).However  full or partial disambiguation takes place in context  and the annotators do not consider unrealistic readings.In (5)  either a lexical nominalisation rule for the adjective Gliickliche is stipulated  or the existence of an empty nominal head.We call such additional edges secondary links and represent them as dotted lines  see fig.In addition  we have adopted a simple convention for those cases in which context information is insufficient  for total disambiguation: the highest possible attachment  site is chosen.Disambiguation is based on human processing skills (cf.This allows easy modification if needed.The tool should also permit a convenient handling of node and edge labels.However  some other standard analysts turn out to be problematic  mainly due to the partial  idealised character of competence grammars  which often marginalise or ignore such important. phenomena. as 'deficient' (e.g. headless) constructions  appositions  temporal expressions  etc.(Cutting et al.  1992) and (Feldweg  1995)).On the basis of these considerations  we formulate several additional requirements.We distinguish five degrees of automation: So far  about 1100 sentences of our corpus have been annotated.These approaches provide an adequate explanation for several issues problematic for phrase-structure grammars (clause union  extraposition  diverse second-position phenomena).(Lehmann et al.  1996)  (Marcus et al.  1994)  (Sampson  1995)).As the annotation scheme does not distinguish different bar levels or any similar intermediate categories  only a small set of node labels is needed (currently 16 tags  S  NP  AP ...).This requirement speaks against the traditional sort of dependency trees  in which heads a re represented as non-terminal nodes  cf.Combining raw language data with linguistic information offers a promising basis for the development of new efficient and robust NLP methods.A problem for the rudimentary argument. structure representations is the use of incomplete structures in natural language  i.e. phenomena such as coordination and ellipsis.
