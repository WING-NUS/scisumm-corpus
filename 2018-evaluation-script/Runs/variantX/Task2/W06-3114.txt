The sign test checks  how likely a sample of better and worse BLEU scores would have been generated by two systems of equal performance.The text type are editorials instead of speech transcripts.For instance  in the recent IWSLT evaluation  first fluency annotations were solicited (while withholding the source sentence)  and then adequacy annotations.To lower the barrier of entrance to the competition  we provided a complete baseline MT system  along with data resources.One annotator suggested that this was the case for as much as 10% of our test sentences.The easiest language pair according to BLEU (English-French: 28.33) received worse manual scores than the hardest (English-German: 14.01).For more on the participating systems  please refer to the respective system description in the proceedings of the workshop.In words  the judgements are normalized  so that the average normalized judgement per judge is 3.Annotators suggested that long sentences are almost impossible to judge.Microsoft’s approach uses dependency trees  others use hierarchical phrase models.Adequacy (rank) Fluency (rank) BLEU (rank) upc-jmc (1-7) (1-8) (1-6) lcc (1-6) (1-7) (1-4) utd (1-7) (1-6) (2-7)

are ranked the same.Out-of-domain test data is from the Project Syndicate web site  a compendium of political commentary.We confirm the finding by Callison-Burch et al. (2006) that the rule-based system of Systran is not adequately appreciated by BLEU.Most of these groups follow a phrase-based statistical approach to machine translation.This decreases the statistical significance of our results compared to those studies.We can check  what the consequences of less manual annotation of results would have been: With half the number of manual judgements  we can distinguish about 40% of the systems  10% less.The human judges were presented with the following definition of adequacy and fluency  but no additional instructions:The manual scores are averages over the raw unnormalized scores.There may be occasionally a system clearly at the top or at the bottom  but most systems are so close that it is hard to distinguish them.We computed BLEU scores for each submission with a single reference translation.We aligned the texts at a sentence level across all four languages  resulting in 1064 sentence per language.Many human evaluation metrics have been proposed.The differences in difficulty are better reflected in the BLEU scores than in the raw un-normalized manual judgements.Not every annotator was fluent in both the source and the target language.When dropping the top and bottom 2.5% the remaining BLEU scores define the range of the confidence interval.This data set of manual judgements should provide a fruitful resource for research on better automatic scoring methods.Given the closeness of most systems and the wide over-lapping confidence intervals it is hard to make strong statements about the correlation between human judgements and automatic scoring methods such as BLEU.Participants and other volunteers contributed about 180 hours of labor in the manual evaluation.If one system is better in 95% of the sample sets  we conclude that its higher BLEU score is statistically significantly better.For the automatic scoring method BLEU  we can distinguish three quarters of the systems.Since all long sentence translation are somewhat muddled  even a contrastive evaluation between systems was difficult.The other half was replaced by other participants  so we ended up with roughly the same number.Following this method  we repeatedly — say  1000 times — sample sets of sentences from the output of each system  measure their BLEU score  and use these 1000 BLEU scores as basis for estimating a confidence interval.The number of judgements is additionally fragmented by our breakup of sentences into in-domain and out-of-domain.At the very least  we are creating a data resource (the manual annotations) that may the basis of future research in evaluation metrics.Figure 1 provides some statistics about this corpus.We settled on contrastive evaluations of 5 system outputs for a single test sentence.Systems that generally do worse than others will receive a negative one.The normalization on a per-judge basis gave very similar ranking  only slightly less consistent with the ranking from the pairwise comparisons.While automatic measures are an invaluable tool for the day-to-day development of machine translation systems  they are only a imperfect substitute for human assessment of translation quality  or as the acronym BLEU puts it  a bilingual evaluation understudy.Systems that generally do better than others will receive a positive average normalizedjudgement per sentence.In the graphs  system scores are indicated by a point  the confidence intervals by shaded areas around the point.Another way to view the judgements is that they are less quality judgements of machine translation systems per se  but rankings of machine translation systems.While building a machine translation system is a serious undertaking  in future we hope to attract more newcomers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry as low as possible.The best answer to this is: many research labs have very competitive systems whose performance is hard to tell apart.English was again paired with German  French  and Spanish.It rewards matches of n-gram sequences  but measures only at most indirectly overall grammatical coherence.Confidence Interval: To estimate confidence intervals for the average mean scores for the systems  we use standard significance testing.This work was supported in part under the GALE program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  Contract No.was done by the participants.Manual and Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation between European LanguagesThe test set included 2000 sentences from the Europarl corpus  but also 1064 sentences out-ofdomain test data.However  a recent study (Callison-Burch et al.  2006)  pointed out that this correlation may not always be strong.A few annotators suggested to break up long sentences into clauses and evaluate these separately.The manual evaluation of scoring translation on a graded scale from 1–5 seems to be very hard to perform.
