Mi(c) is a binary function returning t when parser i (from among the k parsers) suggests constituent c should be in the parse.In each figure the upper graph shows the isolated constituent precision and the bottom graph shows the corresponding number of hypothesized constituents.Each decision determines the inclusion or exclusion of a candidate constituent.We model each parse as the decisions made to create it  and model those decisions as independent events.Two general approaches are presented and two combination techniques are described for each approach.These two principles guide experimentation in this framework  and together with the evaluation measures help us decide which specific type of substructure to combine.We are interested in combining the substructures of the input parses to produce a better parse.The PCFG was trained from the same sections of the Penn Treebank as the other three parsers.The combining technique must act as a multi-position switch indicating which parser should be trusted for the particular sentence.There is a guarantee of no crossing brackets but there is no guarantee that a constituent in the tree has the same children as it had in any of the three original parses.All of these systems were run on data that was not seen during their development.Similar advances have been made in machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg  1994)  speech recognition (Fiscus  1997) and named entity recognition (Borthwick et al.  1998).We include a constituent in our hypothesized parse if it appears in the output of a majority of the parsers.We pick the parse that is most similar to the other parses by choosing the one with the highest sum of pairwise similarities.Again we notice that the isolated constituent precision is larger than 0.5 only in those partitions that contain very few samples.While we cannot prove there are no such useful features on which one should condition trust  we can give some insight into why the features we explored offered no gain.The first row represents the average accuracy of the three parsers we combine.In the cases where isolated constituent precision is larger than 0.5 the affected portion of the hypotheses is negligible.Call the crossing constituents A and B.Another way to interpret this is that less than 5% of the correct constituents are missing from the hypotheses generated by the union of the three parsers.We have presented two general approaches to studying parser combination: parser switching and parse hybridization.There are simply not enough votes remaining to allow any of the crossing structures to enter the hypothesized constituent set.The probabilistic version of this procedure is straightforward: We once again assume independence among our various member parsers.Finally we show the combining techniques degrade very little when a poor parser is added to the set.Another technique for parse hybridization is to use a naïve Bayes classifier to determine which constituents to include in the parse.The substructures that are unanimously hypothesized by the parsers should be preserved after combination  and the combination technique should not foolishly create substructures for which there is no supporting evidence.The second row is the accuracy of the best of the three parsers.'The three parsers were trained and tuned by their creators on various sections of the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank  leaving only sections 22 and 23 completely untouched during the development of any of the parsers.One hybridization strategy is to let the parsers vote on constituents' membership in the hypothesized set.We call such a constituent an isolated constituent.The results of this experiment can be seen in Table 5.Under certain conditions the constituent voting and naïve Bayes constituent combination techniques are guaranteed to produce sets of constituents with no crossing brackets.The constituent voting and naïve Bayes techniques are equivalent because the parameters learned in the training set did not sufficiently discriminate between the three parsers.A receives a votes  and B receives b votes.This drastic tree manipulation is not appropriate for situations in which we want to assign particular structures to sentences.The first shows how constituent features and context do not help in deciding which parser to trust.Because we are working with only three parsers  the only situation in which context will help us is when it can indicate we should choose to believe a single parser that disagrees with the majority hypothesis instead of the majority hypothesis itself.We show the results of three of the experiments we conducted to measure isolated constituent precision under various partitioning schemes.Table 4 shows how much the Bayes switching technique uses each of the parsers on the test set.Both of the switching techniques  as well as the parametric hybridization technique were also shown to be robust when a poor parser was introduced into the experiments.If enough parsers suggest that a particular constituent belongs in the parse  we include it.This is equivalent to the assumption used in probability estimation for naïve Bayes classifiers  namely that the attribute values are conditionally independent when the target value is given.The development of a naïve Bayes classifier involves learning how much each parser should be trusted for the decisions it makes.For each experiment we gave an nonparametric and a parametric technique for combining parsers.It was then tested on section 22 of the Treebank in conjunction with the other parsers.It is possible one could produce better models by introducing features describing constituents and their contexts because one parser could be much better than the majority of the others in particular situations.Here NO counts the number of hypothesized constituents in the development set that match the binary predicate specified as an argument.When this metric is less than 0.5  we expect to incur more errors' than we will remove by adding those constituents to the parse.We performed three experiments to evaluate our techniques.From this we see that a finer-grained model for parser combination  at least for the features we have examined  will not give us any additional power.The maximum precision oracle is an upper bound on the possible gain we can achieve by parse hybridization.The next two rows are results of oracle experiments.
