The next steps are to generate in order: In this case  there are none.Maximum likelihood estimates for the model probabilities can be obtained by observing frequencies in the training corpus.Given a sentence to be analyzed  the search program must find the most likely semantic and syntactic interpretation.The results are summarized in Table 2.For example  in the phrase &quot;Lt. Cmdr.We illustrate the generation process by walking through a few of the steps of the parse shown in Figure 3.Our system for MUC-7 consisted of the sentential model described in this paper  coupled with a simple probability model for cross-sentence merging.An integrated model can limit the propagation of errors by making all decisions jointly.For purposes of pruning  and only for purposes of pruning  the prior probability of each constituent category is multiplied by the generative probability of that constituent (Goodman  1997).Manually creating sourcespecific training data for syntax was not required.The five key facts in this example are: Here  each &quot;reportable&quot; name or description is identified by a &quot;-r&quot; suffix attached to its semantic label.In this paper  we report adapting a lexicalized  probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFG-HR) to information extraction.In our statistical model  trees are generated according to a process similar to that described in (Collins 1996  1997).For each constituent  the head is generated first  followed by the modifiers  which are generated from the head outward.For each organization in an article  one must identify all of its names as used in the article  its type (corporation  government  or other)  and any significant description of it.A single model proved capable of performing all necessary sentential processing  both syntactic and semantic.Other labels indicate relations among entities.It soon became painfully obvious that this task could not be performed in the available time.We now briefly summarize the probability structure of the model.The evaluation results are summarized in Table 1.However  because these estimates are too sparse to be relied upon  we use interpolated estimates consisting of mixtures of successively lowerorder estimates (as in Placeway et al. 1993).For each location  one must also give its type (city  province  county  body of water  etc.).The retrieved articles would then be annotated with augmented tree structures to serve as a training corpus.By necessity  we adopted the strategy of hand marking only the semantics.Post-modifier constituents for the PER/NP.8.The semantics — that is  the entities and relations — can then be directly extracted from these sentential trees.The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies  either expressed or implied  of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or the United States Government.Yet  relatively few have embedded one of these algorithms in a task.We pick up the derivation just after the topmost S and its head word  said  have been produced.However  pipelined architectures suffer from a serious disadvantage: errors accumulate as they propagate through the pipeline.If the single generalized model could then be extended to semantic analysis  all necessary sentence level processing would be contained in that model.A Novel Use of Statistical Parsing to Extract Information from TextAlthough mathematically the model predicts tree elements in a top-down fashion  we search the space bottom-up using a chartbased search.The semantic training corpus was produced by students according to a simple set of guidelines.We have demonstrated  at least for one problem  that a lexicalized  probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFGHR) can be used effectively for information extraction.The categories for head constituents  cl„ are predicted based solely on the category of the parent node  cp: Modifier constituent categories  cm  are predicted based on their parent node  cp  the head constituent of their parent node  chp  the previously generated modifier  c„ _1  and the head word of their parent  wp.Separate probabilities are maintained for left (pre) and right (post) modifiers: Part-of-speech tags  t    for modifiers are predicted based on the modifier  cm  the partof-speech tag of the head word  th  and the head word itself  wh: Head words  w„„ for modifiers are predicted based on the modifier  cm  the part-of-speech tag of the modifier word   t„„ the part-ofspeech tag of the head word   th  and the head word itself  wh: lAwmicm tm th wh)  e.g.These labels serve to form a continuous chain between the relation and its argument.Finally  word features  fm  for modifiers are predicted based on the modifier  cm  the partof-speech tag of the modifier word   t„„ the part-of-speech tag of the head word th  the head word itself  wh  and whether or not the modifier head word  w„„ is known or unknown.We thank Michael Collins of the University of Pennsylvania for his valuable suggestions.We evaluated part-of-speech tagging and parsing accuracy on the Wall Street Journal using a now standard procedure (see Collins 97)  and evaluated name finding accuracy on the MUC7 named entity test.Chiba  (1999) was able to use such a parsing algorithm to reduce perplexity with the long term goal of improved speech recognition.To produce a corpus of augmented parse trees  we used the following multi-step training procedure which exploited the Penn TREEBANK Applying this procedure yielded a new version of the semantically annotated corpus  now annotated with complete augmented trees like that in Figure 3.For example  the coreference relation between &quot;Nance&quot; and &quot;a paid consultant to ABC News&quot; is indicated by &quot;per-desc-of.&quot; In this case  because the argument does not connect directly to the relation  the intervening nodes are labeled with semantics &quot;-ptr&quot; to indicate the connection.David Edwin Lewis &quot; a node is inserted to indicate that &quot;Lt. Cmdr.&quot; is a descriptor for &quot;David Edwin Lewis.&quot; 5.More precisely  it must find the most likely augmented parse tree.In these trees  the standard TREEBANK structures are augmented to convey semantic information  that is  entities and relations.
