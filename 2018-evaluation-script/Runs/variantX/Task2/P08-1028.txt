The applications of the framework discussed here are many and varied both for cognitive science and NLP.We believe that this level of agreement is satisfactory given that naive subjects are asked to provide judgments on fine-grained semantic distinctions (see Table 1).A more scrupulous evaluation requires directly correlating all the individual participants’ similarity judgments with those of the models.6 We used Spearman’s p for our correlation analyses.The average inter-subject agreement5 was ρ = 0.40.Our composition models have no additional parameters beyond the semantic space just described  with three exceptions.Landmarks were taken from WordNet (Fellbaum  1998).This reduces the class of models to: However  this still leaves the particular form of the function f unspecified.This poses problems for modeling linguistic data which is typically represented by vectors with non-random structure.Vector addition does not increase the dimensionality of the resulting vector.We conjecture that the additive models are not sensitive to the fine-grained meaning distinctions involved in our materials.For the hierarchical structure of natural language this binding problem becomes particularly acute.These vectors are not arbitrary and ideally they must exhibit some relation to the words of the construction under consideration.For comparison  we also show the human ratings for these items (UpperBound).The multiplicative and combined models yield means closer to the human ratings.All occurrences of these verbs with a subject noun were next extracted from a RASP parsed (Briscoe and Carroll  2002) version of the British National Corpus (BNC).One potential drawback of multiplicative models is the effect of components with value zero.Materials and Design Our materials consisted of sentences with an an intransitive verb and its subject.Moreover by using a minimal structure we factor out inessential degrees of freedom and are able to assess the merits of different models on an equal footing.49 unpaid volunteers completed the experiment  all native speakers of English.Examples of our items are given in Table 1.Again  better models should correlate better with the experimental data.Here  burn is a high similarity landmark (High) for the reference The fire glowed  whereas beam is a low similarity landmark (Low).We used Fisher’s exact test to determine which verbs and nouns showed the greatest variation in landmark preference and items with p-values greater than 0.001 were discarded.Although the composition model in (5) is commonly used in the literature  from a linguistic perspective  the model in (6) is more appealing.In the following we describe our data collection procedure and give details on how our composition models were constructed and evaluated.Sentence pairs were presented serially in random order.The stimuli were administered to four separate groups; each group saw one set of 100 sentences.We present a general framework for vector-based composition which allows us to consider different classes of models.Experimental results demonstrate that the multiplicative models are superior to the additive alternatives when compared against human judgments.The latter were the most common context words (excluding a stop list of function words).Focusing on a single compositional structure  namely intransitive verbs and their subjects  is a good point of departure for studying vector combination.First  the additive model in (7) weighs differentially the contribution of the two constituents.We also measured how well humans agree in their ratings.The m neighbors most similar to the predicate  and the k of m neighbors closest to its argument.It was not the sales manager who hit the bottle that day  but the office worker with the serious drinking problem. b.We formulated composition as a function of two vectors and introduced several models based on addition and multiplication.However  since it is order independent  it cannot capture meaning differences that are modulated by differences in syntactic structure.While neural networks can readily represent single distinct objects  in the case of multiple objects there are fundamental difficulties in keeping track of which features are bound to which objects.Smolensky (1990) proposed the use of tensor products as a means of binding one vector to another.This yielded a weighted sum consisting of 95% verb  0% noun and 5% of their multiplicative combination.Finally  Kintsch’s (2001) additive model has two extra parameters.We evaluated the models presented in Section 3 on a sentence similarity task initially proposed by Kintsch (2001).The projection is defined in terms of circular convolution a mathematical function that compresses the tensor product of two vectors.It also allows us to derive models in which composition makes use of background knowledge K and models in which composition has a dependence  via the argument R  on syntax.For each reference verb  the subjects’ responses were entered into a contingency table  whose rows corresponded to nouns and columns to each possible answer (i.e.  one of the two landmarks).Now  if we assume that p lies in the same space as u and v  avoiding the issues of dimensionality associated with tensor products  and that f is a linear function  for simplicity  of the cartesian product of u and v  then we generate a class of additive models: where A and B are matrices which determine the contributions made by u and v to the product p. In contrast  if we assume that f is a linear function of the tensor product of u and v  then we obtain multiplicative models: where C is a tensor of rank 3  which projects the tensor product of u and v onto the space of p. Further constraints can be introduced to reduce the free parameters in these models.Importantly  additive models capture composition by considering all vector components representing the meaning of the verb and its subject  whereas multiplicative models consider a subset  namely non-zero components.For additive models  a natural way to achieve this is to include further vectors into the summation.Instead  it could be argued that the contribution of the ith component of u should be scaled according to its relevance to v  and vice versa.As we can see sentences with high similarity landmarks are perceived as more similar to the reference sentence.In contrast to the simple additive model  this extended model is sensitive to syntactic structure  since n is chosen from among the neighbors of the predicate  distinguishing it from the argument.Relaxing the assumption of symmetry in the case of the simple additive model produces a model which weighs the contribution of the two components differently: This allows additive models to become more syntax aware  since semantically important constituents can participate more actively in the composition.
