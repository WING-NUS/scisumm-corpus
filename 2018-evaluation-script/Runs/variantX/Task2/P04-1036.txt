This seems intuitive given our expected relative usage of these senses in modern British English.A major motivation for our work is to try to capture changes in ranking of senses for documents from different domains.The acquired predominant senses give a of 64% on the nouns of the 2 English all-words task.We use WordNet as our sense inventory for this work.The measures provide a similarity score between two WordNet senses ( and )  these being synsets within WordNet. lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen  2002) This score maximises the number of overlapping words in the gloss  or definition  of the senses.We generated a thesaurus entry for all polysemous nouns in WordNet as described in section 2.1 above.Since SemCor is derived from the Brown corpus  which predates the BNC by up to 30 years 5 and contains a higher proportion of fiction 6  the high ranking for the tobacco pipe sense according to SemCor seems plausible.For the experiments in sections 3 and 4 we used the 90 million words of written English from the BNC.The FINANCE corpus consists of 117734 documents (about 32.5 million words).We experiment with several WordNet Similarity measures (Patwardhan and Pedersen  2003) which aim to capture semantic relatedness withinAdditionally  we evaluated our method quantitatively using the Subject Field Codes (SFC) resource (Magnini and Cavagli`a  2000) which annotates WordNet synsets with domain labels.We obtained the predominant sense for each of these words and used these to label the instances in the noun data within the SENSEVAL-2 English allwords task.We describe some related work in section 6 and conclude in section 7. are therefore investigating a method of automatically ranking WordNet senses from raw text.Another example where the ranking is intuitive  is soil.Many researchers are developing thesauruses from automatically parsed data.To disambiguate senses a system should take context into account.Most research in WSD concentrates on using contextual features  typically neighbouring words  to help determine the correct sense of a target word.The word share is among the words whose predominant sense remained the same for all three corpora.Each 2We use this version of WordNet since it allows us to map information to WordNets of other languages more accurately.This seems quite reasonable given the nearest neighbours: tube  cable  wire  tank  hole  cylinder  fitting  tap  cistern  plate....It only requires raw text from the given domain and because of this it can easily be applied to a new domain  or sense inventory  given sufficient text.If is the set of co-occurrence types such that is positive then the similarity between two nouns  and   can be computed as: where: A thesaurus entry of size for a target noun is then defined as the most similar nouns to .Even given the difference in text type between SemCor and the BNC the results are encouraging  especially given that our results are for polysemous nouns.Lapata and Brew obtain their priors for verb classes directly from subcategorisation evidence in a parsed corpus  whereas we use parsed data to find distributionally similar words (nearest neighbours) to the target word which reflect the different senses of the word and have associated distributional similarity scores which can be used for ranking the senses according to prevalence.Thus  if we used the sense ranking as a heuristic for an “all nouns” task we would expect to get precision in the region of 60%.This method obtains precision of 61% and recall 51%.However  it is important to know the performance of this heuristic for any systems that use it.The words included in this experiment are not a random sample  since we anticipated different predominant senses in the SPORTS and FINANCE domains for these words.This is to be expected regardless of any inherent shortcomings of the ranking technique since the senses within SemCor will differ compared to those of the BNC.We chose the domains of SPORTS and FINANCE since there is sufficient material for these domains in this publically available corpus.This work was funded by EU-2001-34460 project MEANING: Developing Multilingual Web-scale Language Technologies  UK EPSRC project Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing (RASP) and a UK EPSRC studentship.This figure shows the domain labels assigned to the predominant senses for the set of 38 words after ranking the words using the SPORTS and the FINANCE corpora.This demonstrates that our method of providing a first sense from raw text will help when sense-tagged data is not available.In this work the lists of neighbours are themselves clustered to bring out the various senses of the word.It would be useful however to combine our method of finding predominant senses with one which can automatically find new senses within text and relate these to WordNet synsets  as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) do with unknown nouns.We experimented using six of these to provide the in equation 1 above and obtained results well over our baseline  but because of space limitations give results for the two which perform the best.We have demonstrated the possibility of finding predominant senses in domain specific corpora on a sample of nouns.The jcn measure uses corpus data for the calculation of IC.The first ranked sense according to SemCor is the filth  stain: state of being unclean sense whereas the automatic ranking lists dirt  ground  earth as the first sense  which is the second ranked sense according to SemCor.The first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised WSD systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account.We use the WordNet Similarity Package 0.05 and WordNet version 1.6.The paper is structured as follows.In these each target word is entered with an ordered list of “nearest neighbours”.Lapata and Brew (2004) have recently also highlighted the importance of a good prior in WSD.This is shown by the results of the English all-words task in SENSEVAL-2 (Cotton et al.  1998) in figure 1 below  where the first sense is that listed in WordNet for the PoS given by the Penn TreeBank (Palmer et al.  2001).Finding Predominant Word Senses in Untagged TextThe results for 10 of the words from the qualitative experiment are summarized in table 3 with the WordNet sense number for each word supplied alongside synonyms or hypernyms from WordNet for readability.The SFC contains an economy label and a sports label.More importantly  when working within a specific domain one would wish to tune the first sense heuristic to the domain at hand.For example  in WordNet the first listed sense ofpipe is tobacco pipe  and this is ranked joint first according to the Brown files in SemCor with the second sense tube made of metal or plastic used to carry water  oil or gas etc....In the future  we will perform a large scale evaluation on domain specific corpora.
