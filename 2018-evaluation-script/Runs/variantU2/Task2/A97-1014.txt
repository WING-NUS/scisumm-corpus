 The resulting scheme reflects a stratificational notion of language and makes only minimal assumpabout the interrelation of the particu- â€¢lar representational strata Due to the substantial differences between existing models of constituent structure the question arises of how the theory independencf requirement can be satisfied In light of these facts serious difficulties can be expected arising from the structural component of the existing formalisms During the first phase the focus is on annotating correct structures and a coarse-grained classification of grammatical functions which represent the following areas of information: Dependency type: complements are further classified according to features such as category and case: clausal complements (OC) accusative objects (OA) datives (DA) etc Apart from this rather technical problem two further arguments speak against phrase structure as the structural pivot of the annotation scheme: Finally the structural handling of free word order means stating well-formedness constraints on structures involving many trace-filler dependencies which has proved tedious The head of the phrase can be determined in a similar way according to theory-specific assumptions rizations and attachments that have been observed in online experiments of language production and comprehension can now be put in relation with the frequency of these alternatives in larger amounts of texts Since the requirements for such a formalism differ from those posited for configurational languages several features have been added influencing the architecture of the scheme In addition the approach provides empirical material for psycholinguistic investigation since preferences for the choice of certain syntactic constructions linea cified representations: the coordinated units are assigned structures in which missing lexical material is not represented at the level of primary links
