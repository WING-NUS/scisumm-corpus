The normalization on a per-judge basis gave very similar ranking  only slightly less consistent with the ranking from the pairwise comparisons.While we used the standard metrics of the community  the we way presented translations and prompted for assessment differed from other evaluation campaigns.Replacing this with an ranked evaluation seems to be more suitable.We are therefore applying a different method  which has been used at the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.The results of the manual and automatic evaluation of the participating system translations is detailed in the figures at the end of this paper.We carried out an extensive manual and automatic evaluation of machine translation performance on European language pairs.English was again paired with German  French  and Spanish.• We evaluated translation from English  in addition to into English.There is twice as much language modelling data  since training data for the machine translation system is filtered against sentences of length larger than 40 words.Manual and Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation between European LanguagesBecause of this  we retokenized and lowercased submitted output with our own tokenizer  which was also used to prepare the training and test data.The test set included 2000 sentences from the Europarl corpus  but also 1064 sentences out-ofdomain test data.The test data was again drawn from a segment of the Europarl corpus from the fourth quarter of 2000  which is excluded from the training data.In addition to the Europarl test set  we also collected 29 editorials from the Project Syndicate website2  which are published in all the four languages of the shared task.The BLEU score has been shown to correlate well with human judgement  when statistical machine translation systems are compared (Doddington  2002; Przybocki  2004; Li  2005).Another way to view the judgements is that they are less quality judgements of machine translation systems per se  but rankings of machine translation systems.While automatic measures are an invaluable tool for the day-to-day development of machine translation systems  they are only a imperfect substitute for human assessment of translation quality  or as the acronym BLEU puts it  a bilingual evaluation understudy.We confirm the finding by Callison-Burch et al. (2006) that the rule-based system of Systran is not adequately appreciated by BLEU.While many systems had similar performance  the results offer interesting insights  especially about the relative performance of statistical and rule-based systems.However  ince we extracted the test corpus automatically from web sources  the reference translation was not always accurate — due to sentence alignment errors  or because translators did not adhere to a strict sentence-by-sentence translation (say  using pronouns when referring to entities mentioned in the previous sentence).For instance  in the recent IWSLT evaluation  first fluency annotations were solicited (while withholding the source sentence)  and then adequacy annotations.We aligned the texts at a sentence level across all four languages  resulting in 1064 sentence per language.By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output  we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output  which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.However  a recent study (Callison-Burch et al.  2006)  pointed out that this correlation may not always be strong.The bootstrap method has been critized by Riezler and Maxwell (2005) and Collins et al. (2005)  as being too optimistic in deciding for statistical significant difference between systems.This is demonstrated by average scores over all systems  in terms of BLEU  fluency and adequacy  as displayed in Figure 5.Due to many similarly performing systems  we are not able to draw strong conclusions on the question of correlation of manual and automatic evaluation metrics.Many human evaluation metrics have been proposed.The number of judgements is additionally fragmented by our breakup of sentences into in-domain and out-of-domain.Hence  we use the bootstrap resampling method described by Koehn (2004).Still  for about good number of sentences  we do have this direct comparison  which allows us to apply the sign test  as described in Section 2.2.For the manual scoring  we can distinguish only half of the systems  both in terms of fluency and adequacy.It was our hope that this competition  which included the manual and automatic evaluation of statistical systems and one rulebased commercial system  will give further insight into the relation between automatic and manual evaluation.At first glance  we quickly recognize that many systems are scored very similar  both in terms of manual judgement and BLEU.We asked participants to each judge 200–300 sentences in terms of fluency and adequacy  the most commonly used manual evaluation metrics.Automatic scores are computed on a larger tested than manual scores (3064 sentences vs. 300–400 sentences). collected manual judgements  we do not necessarily have the same sentence judged for both systems (judges evaluate 5 systems out of the 8–10 participating systems).Given the closeness of most systems and the wide over-lapping confidence intervals it is hard to make strong statements about the correlation between human judgements and automatic scoring methods such as BLEU.Training and testing is based on the Europarl corpus.We are currently working on a complete open source implementation of a training and decoding system  which should become available over the summer. pus  from which also the in-domain test set is taken.We settled on contrastive evaluations of 5 system outputs for a single test sentence.We divide up each test set into blocks of 20 sentences (100 blocks for the in-domain test set  53 blocks for the out-of-domain test set)  check for each block  if one system has a higher BLEU score than the other  and then use the sign test.Also  the argument has been made that machine translation performance should be evaluated via task-based evaluation metrics  i.e. how much it assists performing a useful task  such as supporting human translators or aiding the analysis of texts.Lack of correct reference translations was pointed out as a short-coming of our evaluation.Hence  the different averages of manual scores for the different language pairs reflect the behaviour of the judges  not the quality of the systems on different language pairs.For each sentence  we counted how many n-grams in the system output also occurred in the reference translation.
