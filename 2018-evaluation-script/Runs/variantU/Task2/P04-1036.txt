The first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised WSD systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account.We are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic  and this method  for other PoS on SENSEVAL-3 data (McCarthy et al.  2004)  although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora.Even systems which show superior performance to this heuristic often make use of the heuristic where evidence from the context is not sufficient (Hoste et al.  2001).We believe that an automatic means of finding a predominant sense would be useful for systems that use it as a means of backing-off (Wilks and Stevenson  1998; Hoste et al.  2001) and for systems that use it in lexical acquisition (McCarthy  1997; Merlo and Leybold  2001; Korhonen  2002) because of the limited size of hand-tagged resources.However  the most accurate WSD systems are those which require manually sense tagged data in the first place  and their accuracy depends on the quantity of training examples (Yarowsky and Florian  2002) available.Whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as SemCor is clearly useful  there is a strong case for obtaining a first  or predominant  sense from untagged corpus data so that a WSD system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.There are words where the first sense in WordNet is counter-intuitive  because of the size of the corpus  and because where the frequency data does not indicate a first sense  the ordering is arbitrary.We have devised a method that uses raw corpus data to automatically find a predominant sense for nouns in WordNet.It would be useful however to combine our method of finding predominant senses with one which can automatically find new senses within text and relate these to WordNet synsets  as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) do with unknown nouns.We briefly summarise the two measures here; for a more detailed summary see (Patwardhan et al.  2003).We experiment with several WordNet Similarity measures (Patwardhan and Pedersen  2003) which aim to capture semantic relatedness withinThis is shown by the results of the English all-words task in SENSEVAL-2 (Cotton et al.  1998) in figure 1 below  where the first sense is that listed in WordNet for the PoS given by the Penn TreeBank (Palmer et al.  2001).We want to investigate the effect of frequency and choice of distributional similarity measure (Weeds et al.  2004).Lapata and Brew obtain their priors for verb classes directly from subcategorisation evidence in a parsed corpus  whereas we use parsed data to find distributionally similar words (nearest neighbours) to the target word which reflect the different senses of the word and have associated distributional similarity scores which can be used for ranking the senses according to prevalence.We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically.It uses the glosses of semantically related (according to WordNet) senses too. jcn (Jiang and Conrath  1997) This score uses corpus data to populate classes (synsets) in the WordNet hierarchy with frequency counts.Buitelaar and Sacaleanu (2001) have previously explored ranking and selection of synsets in GermaNet for specific domains using the words in a given synset  and those related by hyponymy  and a term relevance measure taken from information retrieval.In order to see how well the automatically acquired predominant sense performs on a WSD task from which the WordNet sense ordering has not been taken  we use the SENSEVAL-2 all-words data (Palmer et al.  2001).The results in table 1 show the accuracy of the ranking with respect to SemCor over the entire set of 2595 polysemous nouns in SemCor with the jcn and lesk WordNet similarity measures.We then use the WordNet similarity package (Patwardhan and Pedersen  2003) to give us a semantic similarity measure (hereafter referred to as the WordNet similarity measure) to weight the contribution that each neighbour makes to the various senses of the target word.We see that both domains have a similarly high percentage of factotum (domain independent) labels  but as we would expect  the other peaks correspond to the economy label for the FINANCE corpus  and the sports label for the SPORTS corpus. inant senses for 38 polysemous words ranked using the SPORTS and FINANCE corpus.In contrast  we use the neighbours lists and WordNet similarity measures to impose a prevalence ranking on the WordNet senses.To find the first sense of a word ( ) we take each sense in turn and obtain a score reflecting the prevalence which is used for ranking.The senses in WordNet are ordered according to the frequency data in the manually tagged resource SemCor (Miller et al.  1993).The measures provide a similarity score between two WordNet senses ( and )  these being synsets within WordNet. lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen  2002) This score maximises the number of overlapping words in the gloss  or definition  of the senses.Let be the ordered set of the top scoring neighbours of from the thesaurus with associated distributional similarity scores The thesaurus was acquired using the method described by Lin (1998).Both WordNet similarity measures beat this baseline.In this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses.Thus we rank each sense using: parser (Briscoe and Carroll  2002).It is not always intuitively clear which of the senses to expect as predominant sense for either a particular domain or for the BNC  but the first senses of words like division and goal shift towards the more specific senses (league and score respectively).We acquired thesauruses for these corpora using the procedure described in section 2.1.Lapata and Brew (2004) have recently also highlighted the importance of a good prior in WSD.More importantly  when working within a specific domain one would wish to tune the first sense heuristic to the domain at hand.Magnini and Cavagli`a (2000) have identified WordNet word senses with particular domains  and this has proven useful for high precision WSD (Magnini et al.  2001); indeed in section 5 we used these domain labels for evaluation.Even given the difference in text type between SemCor and the BNC the results are encouraging  especially given that our results are for polysemous nouns.Since both measures gave comparable results we restricted our remaining experiments to jcn because this gave good results for finding the predominant sense  and is much more efficient than lesk  given the precompilation of the IC files.Moreover  the chosen senses of the word tie proved to be a textbook example of the behaviour we expected.Furthermore  we demonstrate that our method discovers appropriate predominant senses for words from two domainspecific corpora.Nevertheless  since many systems performed well on the English all-words task for SENSEVAL-2 by using the frequency information in SemCor this is a reasonable approach for evaluation.
