In general the lemma of the previous section does not ensure that all the productions in the combined parse are found in the grammars of the member parsers
The second row is the accuracy of the best of the three parsers
This is the parse that is closest to the centroid of the observed parses under the similarity metric
The counts represent portions of the approximately 44000 constituents hypothesized by the parsers in the development set
Another way to interpret this is that less than 5% of the correct constituents are missing from the hypotheses generated by the union of the three parsers
Furthermore we know one of the original parses will be the hypothesized parse so the direct method of determining which one is best is to compute the probability of each of the candidate parses using the probabilistic model we developed in Section 2
We pick the parse that is most similar to the other parses by choosing the one with the highest sum of pairwise similarities
The set of candidate constituents comes from the union of all the constituents suggested by the member parsers
C is the union of the sets of constituents suggested by the parsers
The estimation of the probabilities in the model is carried out as shown in Equation 4
In each figure the upper graph shows the isolated constituent precision and the bottom graph shows the corresponding number of hypothesized constituents
Similarly Figures 1 and 2 show how the isolated constituent precision varies by sentence length and the size of the span of the hypothesized constituent
