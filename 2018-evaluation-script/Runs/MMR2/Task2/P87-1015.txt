We examine both the complexity of the paths of trees in the tree sets and the kinds of dependencies that the formalisms can impose between paths
Each treelet (an internal node with all its children) represents the use of a rule that is encapsulated by the grammar The grammar encapsulates (either explicitly or implicitly) a finite number of rules that can be written as follows: n > 0 In the case of CFG's for each production In the case of TAG's a derivation step in which the derived trees RI • • • On are adjoined into fi at rhe addresses • • • • in
The independence of paths in the tree sets of the k tI grammatical formalism in this hierarchy can be shown by means of tree pumping lemma of the form t1ti3t
1) adds the constant equal to the sum of the length of the strings VI un+r• Since we are considering formalisms with arbitrary structures it is difficult to precisely specify all of the restrictions on the composition operations that we believe would appropriately generalize the concatenation operation for the particular structures used by the formalism
As with HG's derivation structures are annotated; in the case of TAG's by the trees used for adjunction and addresses of nodes of the elementary tree where adjunctions occurred
In this section for the purposes of showing that polynomial time recognition is possible we make the additional restriction that the contribution of a derived structure to the input string can be specified by a bounded sequence of substrings of the input
