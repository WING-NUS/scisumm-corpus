We expect that the quantity and similarity of the neighbours pertaining to different senses will reflect the dominance of the sense to which they pertain
For the experiments in sections 3 and 4 we used the 90 million words of written English from the BNC
This figure shows the domain labels assigned to the predominant senses for the set of 38 words after ranking the words using the SPORTS and the FINANCE corpora
It is not always intuitively clear which of the senses to expect as predominant sense for either a particular domain or for the BNC but the first senses of words like division and goal shift towards the more specific senses (league and score respectively)
There are words where the first sense in WordNet is counter-intuitive because of the size of the corpus and because where the frequency data does not indicate a first sense the ordering is arbitrary
We obtained the predominant sense for each of these words and used these to label the instances in the noun data within the SENSEVAL-2 English allwords task
We use an allwords task because the predominant senses will reflect the sense distributions of all nouns within the documents rather than a lexical sample task where the target words are manually determined and the results will depend on the skew of the words in the sample
This weight is the WordNet similarity score ( ) between the target sense ( ) and the sense of ( ) that maximises this score divided by the sum of all such WordNet similarity scores for and
