However there is a trade-off between the granularity of information encoded in the labels and the speed and accuracy of annotation
For instance the first determiner among the NK's can be treated as the specifier of the phrase
As theory-independence is one of our objectives the annotation scheme incorporates a number of widely accepted linguistic analyses especially in the area of verbal adverbial and adjectival syntax
3 shows the representation of the sentence: (6) sic wurde von preuBischen Truppen besetzt she was by Prussian troops occupied und 1887 dem preuliischen Staat angegliedert and 1887 to-the Prussian state incorporated 'it was occupied by Prussian troops and incorporated into Prussia in 1887' The category of the coordination is labeled CVP here where C stands for coordination and VP for the actual category
criterion for the success of the developed methodology and tools
This amount of data suffices as training material to reliably assign the grammatical functions if the user determines the elements of a phrase and its type (step 1 of the list above)
Moreover the so-called DP analysis views the article der as the head of the phrase
If its probability is close to the winner (closeness is defined by a threshold on the quotient) the assignment is regarded as unreliable and the annotator is asked to confirm the assignment
Because of the intended theory-independence of the scheme we annotate only the common minimum
Due to the substantial differences between existing models of constituent structure the question arises of how the theory independencf requirement can be satisfied
