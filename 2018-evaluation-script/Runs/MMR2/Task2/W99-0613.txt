The weak learner for two-class problems computes a weak hypothesis h from the input space into the reals (h : 2x -4 R) where the sign4 of h(x) is interpreted as the predicted label and the magnitude I h(x)I is the confidence in the prediction: large numbers for I h(x)I indicate high confidence in the prediction and numbers close to zero indicate low confidence
In fact Zco provides a bound on the sum of the classification error of the labeled examples and the number of disagreements between the two classifiers on the unlabeled examples
The final strong hypothesis denoted 1(x) is then the sign of a weighted sum of the weak hypotheses 1(x) = sign (Vii atht(x)) where the weights at are determined during the run of the algorithm as we describe below
fraud related to work on a federally funded sewage plant in Georgia In this case Georgia is extracted: the NP containing it is a complement to the preposition in; the PP headed by in modifies the NP a federally funded sewage plant whose head is the singular noun plant
Formally let el (62) be the number of classification errors of the first (second) learner on the training data and let Eco be the number of unlabeled examples on which the two classifiers disagree
Before describing the unsupervised case we first describe the supervised version of the algorithm: Input to the learning algorithm: n labeled examples of the form (xi y„)
For the purposes of EM the &quot;observed&quot; data is {(xi Ya• • • (xrn Yrn) xfil and the hidden data is {ym+i y}
