In the first stage we run a single step of label propagation which transfers the label distributions from the English vertices to the connected foreign language vertices (say Vf�) at the periphery of the graph
This stage of label propagation results in a tag distribution ri over labels y which encodes the proportion of times the middle word of ui E Vf aligns to English words vy tagged with label y: The second stage consists of running traditional label propagation to propagate labels from these peripheral vertices Vf� to all foreign language vertices in the graph optimizing the following objective: 5 POS Induction After running label propagation (LP) we compute tag probabilities for foreign word types x by marginalizing the POS tag distributions of foreign trigrams ui = x− x x+ over the left and right context words: where the qi (i = 1
Given this similarity function we define a nearest neighbor graph where the edge weight for the n most similar vertices is set to the value of the similarity function and to 0 for all other vertices
This formulation of the constraint feature is equivalent to the use of a tagging dictionary extracted from the graph using a threshold T on the posterior distribution of tags for a given word type (Eq
Given the bilingual graph described in the previous section we can use label propagation to project the English POS labels to the foreign language
By aggregating the POS labels of the English tokens to types we can generate label distributions for the English vertices
