2 In the first encoding scheme called Head we use a new label d↑h for each lifted arc where d is the dependency relation between the syntactic head and the dependent in the non-projective representation and h is the dependency relation that the syntactic head has to its own head in the underlying structure
By applying an inverse transformation to the output of the parser arcs with non-standard labels can be lowered to their proper place in the dependency graph giving rise 1The dependency graph has been modified to make the final period a dependent of the main verb instead of being a dependent of a special root node for the sentence
In the second scheme Head+Path we in addition modify the label of every arc along the lifting path from the syntactic to the linear head so that if the original label is p the new label is p↓
In principle it would be possible to encode the exact position of the syntactic head in the label of the arc from the linear head but this would give a potentially infinite set of arc labels and would make the training of the parser very hard
In practice we can therefore expect a trade-off such that increasing the amount of information encoded in arc labels will cause an increase in the accuracy of the inverse transformation but a decrease in the accuracy with which the parser can construct the labeled representations
We also see that the increase in the size of the label sets for Head and Head+Path is far below the theoretical upper bounds given in Table 1
