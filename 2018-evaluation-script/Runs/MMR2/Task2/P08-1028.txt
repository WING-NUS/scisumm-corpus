Central in these models is the notion of compositionality â€” the meaning of complex expressions is determined by the meanings of their constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them
Now if we assume that p lies in the same space as u and v avoiding the issues of dimensionality associated with tensor products and that f is a linear function for simplicity of the cartesian product of u and v then we generate a class of additive models: where A and B are matrices which determine the contributions made by u and v to the product p
So if we assume that only the ith components of u and v contribute to the ith component of p that these components are not dependent on i and that the function is symmetric with regard to the interchange of u and v we obtain a simpler instantiation of an additive model: Analogously under the same assumptions we obtain the following simpler multiplicative model: only the ith components of u and v contribute to the ith component of p
An extreme form of this differential in the contribution of constituents is where one of the vectors say u contributes nothing at all to the combination: Admittedly the model in (8) is impoverished and rather simplistic however it can serve as a simple baseline against which to compare more sophisticated models
Relaxing the assumption of symmetry in the case of the simple additive model produces a model which weighs the contribution of the two components differently: This allows additive models to become more syntax aware since semantically important constituents can participate more actively in the composition
