Hence we take the probability of the event fmnh analyzed as REL VB to be This means that we generate f and mnh independently depending on their corresponding PoS tags and the context (as well as the syntactic relation between the two) is modeled via the derivation resulting in a sequence REL VB spanning the form fmnh
One way to approach this discrepancy is to assume a preceding phase of morphological segmentation for extracting the different lexical items that exist at the token level (as is done to the best of our knowledge in all parsing related work on Arabic and its dialects (Chiang et al
Table 2 compares the performance of our system on the setup of Cohen and Smith (2007) to the best results reported by them for the same tasks
The implication of this ambiguity for a parser is that the yield of syntactic trees no longer consists of spacedelimited tokens and the expected number of leaves in the syntactic analysis in not known in advance
To evaluate the performance on the segmentation task we report SEG the standard harmonic means for segmentation Precision and Recall F1 (as defined in Bar-Haim et al
Our use of an unweighted lattice reflects our belief that all the segmentations of the given input sentence are a-priori equally likely; the only reason to prefer one segmentation over the another is due to the overall syntactic context which is modeled via the PCFG derivations
Tsarfaty (2006) argues that for Semitic languages determining the correct morphological segmentation is dependent on syntactic context and shows that increasing information sharing between the morphological and the syntactic components leads to improved performance on the joint task
