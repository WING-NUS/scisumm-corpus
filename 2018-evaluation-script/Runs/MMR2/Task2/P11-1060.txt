The full definition of join is as follows: Aggregate The aggregate operation takes a denotation and forms a set out of the tuples in the first column for each setting of the rest of the columns: Now we turn to the mark (M) and execute (Xi) operations which handles the divergence between syntactic and semantic scope
We now turn to the task of mapping natural language For the example in Figure 4(b) the de- utterances to DCS trees
For example In a DCS tree the quantifier appears as the child of a Q relation and the restrictor is the parent (see Figure 4(b) for an example)
What is the total population of the ten largest capitals in the US?
The logical forms in this framework are trees which is desirable for two reasons: (i) they parallel syntactic dependency trees which facilitates parsing and learning; and (ii) evaluating them to obtain the answer is computationally efficient
The recurrence is as follows: At each node we compute the set of tuples v consistent with the predicate at that node (v ∈ w(p)) and S(x)} where a set of pairs S is treated as a set-valued function S(x) = {y : (x y) ∈ S} with domain S1 = {x : (x y) ∈ S}
Next we compared our systems (DCS and DCS+) with the state-of-the-art semantic parsers on the full dataset for both GEO and JOBS (see Table 3)
The key idea that allows us to give semanticallyscoped denotations to syntactically-scoped trees is as follows: We mark a node low in the tree with a mark relation (one of E Q or C)
