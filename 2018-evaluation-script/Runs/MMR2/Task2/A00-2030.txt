&quot; In this case because the argument does not connect directly to the relation the intervening nodes are labeled with semantics &quot;-ptr&quot; to indicate the connection
syntactic modifier of the other the inserted node serves to indicate the relation as well as the argument
The categories for head constituents cl„ are predicted based solely on the category of the parent node cp: Modifier constituent categories cm are predicted based on their parent node cp the head constituent of their parent node chp the previously generated modifier c„ _1 and the head word of their parent wp
Separate probabilities are maintained for left (pre) and right (post) modifiers: Part-of-speech tags t for modifiers are predicted based on the modifier cm the partof-speech tag of the head word th and the head word itself wh: Head words w„„ for modifiers are predicted based on the modifier cm the part-of-speech tag of the modifier word t„„ the part-ofspeech tag of the head word th and the head word itself wh: lAwmicm tm th wh) e
