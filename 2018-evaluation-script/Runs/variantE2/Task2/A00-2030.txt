 We evaluated the new approach to information extraction on two of the tasks of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) and reported in (Marsh 1998) Currently the prevailing architecture for dividing sentential processing is a four-stage pipeline consisting of: Since we were interested in exploiting recent advances in parsing replacing the syntactic analysis stage of the standard pipeline with a modern statistical parser was an obvious possibility Almost all approaches to information extraction — even at the sentence level — are based on the divide-and-conquer strategy of reducing a complex problem to a set of simpler ones Given a new sentence the outcome of this search process is a tree structure that encodes both the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentence For the following example the The Template Relations (TR) task involves identifying instances of three relations in the text: TR builds on TE in that TR reports binary relations between elements of TE Given multiple constituents that cover identical spans in the chart only those constituents with probabilities within a While our focus throughout the project was on TE and TR we became curious about how well the model did at part-of-speech tagging syntactic parsing and at name finding Thus each component of what would be the first three stages of our pipeline was based on the same general class of statistical model Thus the scores used in pruning can be considered as the product of: 1 syntactic modifier of the other the inserted node serves to indicate the relation as well as the argument
