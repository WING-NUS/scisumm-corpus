 Because the information flow in our graph is asymmetric (from English to the foreign language) we use different types of vertices for each language This formulation of the constraint feature is equivalent to the use of a tagging dictionary extracted from the graph using a threshold T on the posterior distribution of tags for a given word type (Eq To initialize the graph for label propagation we use a supervised English tagger to label the English side of the bitext This scenario is applicable to a large set of languages and has been considered by a number of authors in the past (Alshawi et al Given the bilingual graph described in the previous section we can use label propagation to project the English POS labels to the foreign language To make the projection practical we rely on the twelve universal part-of-speech tags of Petrov et al 7 We then simply count the individual labels of the English tokens and normalize the counts to produce tag distributions over English word types The focus of this work is on building POS taggers for foreign languages assuming that we have an English POS tagger and some parallel text between the two languages To this end we construct a bilingual graph over word types to establish a connection between the two languages (ยง3) and then use graph label propagation to project syntactic information from English to the foreign language (ยง4) Supervised part-of-speech (POS) taggers for example approach the level of inter-annotator agreement (Shen et al
