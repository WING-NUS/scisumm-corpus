 We examine both the complexity of the paths of trees in the tree sets and the kinds of dependencies that the formalisms can impose between paths Similarly for all the LCFRS's discussed in Section 2 we can define the relationship between a structure and the sequence of substrings it spans and the effect of the composition operations on sequences of substrings In addition the restricted version of CG's (discussed in Section 6) generates tree sets with independent paths and we hope that it can be included in a more general definition of LCFRS's containing formalisms whose tree sets have path sets that are themselves LCFRL's (as in the case of the restricted indexed grammars and the hierarchy defined by Weir) The independence of paths in the tree sets of the k tI grammatical formalism in this hierarchy can be shown by means of tree pumping lemma of the form t1ti3t In considering this aspect of a formalism we hope to better understand the relationship between the structural descriptions generated by the grammars of a formalism and the properties of semilinearity and polynomial recognizability We consider the structural descriptions produced by various grammatical formalisms in terms of the complexity of the paths and the relationship between paths in the sets of structural descriptions that each system can generate In considering the relationship between formalisms we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees
