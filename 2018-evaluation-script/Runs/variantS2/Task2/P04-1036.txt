 We use an allwords task because the predominant senses will reflect the sense distributions of all nouns within the documents rather than a lexical sample task where the target words are manually determined and the results will depend on the skew of the words in the sample There are words where the first sense in WordNet is counter-intuitive because of the size of the corpus and because where the frequency data does not indicate a first sense the ordering is arbitrary The acquired predominant senses give a of 64% on the nouns of the 2 English all-words task word sense disambiguation the heuristic of choosing the most common sense is extremely powerful because the distribution of the senses of a word is often skewed The word share is among the words whose predominant sense remained the same for all three corpora The results for 10 of the words from the qualitative experiment are summarized in table 3 with the WordNet sense number for each word supplied alongside synonyms or hypernyms from WordNet for readability The high performance of the first sense baseline is due to the skewed frequency distribution of word senses Whilst there are a few hand-tagged corpora available for some languages one would expect the frequency distribution of the senses of words particularly topical words to depend on the genre and domain of the text under consideration The performance of the predominant sense provided in the SENSEVAL-2 test data provides an upper bound for this task We compare results using the first sense listed in SemCor and the first sense according to the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words test data itself
