 Current state-of-the-art broad-coverage parsers assume a direct correspondence between the lexical items ingrained in the proposed syntactic analyses (the yields of syntactic parse-trees) and the spacedelimited tokens (henceforth ‘tokens’) that constitute the unanalyzed surface forms (utterances) The implication of this ambiguity for a parser is that the yield of syntactic trees no longer consists of spacedelimited tokens and the expected number of leaves in the syntactic analysis in not known in advance When a token fmnh is to be interpreted as the lexeme sequence f/REL mnh/VB the analysis introduces two distinct entities the relativizer f (“that”) and the verb mnh (“counted”) and not as the complex entity “that counted” One way to approach this discrepancy is to assume a preceding phase of morphological segmentation for extracting the different lexical items that exist at the token level (as is done to the best of our knowledge in all parsing related work on Arabic and its dialects (Chiang et al Tsarfaty (2006) argues that for Semitic languages determining the correct morphological segmentation is dependent on syntactic context and shows that increasing information sharing between the morphological and the syntactic components leads to improved performance on the joint task Our use of an unweighted lattice reflects our belief that all the segmentations of the given input sentence are a-priori equally likely; the only reason to prefer one segmentation over the another is due to the overall syntactic context which is modeled via the PCFG derivations ‘bcl hneim’ (literally “in-the-shadow the-pleasant” meaning roughly “in the pleasant shadow”) in which the dominated Noun is modified by a proceeding space-delimited adjective
