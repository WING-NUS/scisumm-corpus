Each tuple is a set of documents that are loosely equivalent to each other  but written in different languages  e.g.  corresponding Wikipedia articles in French  English and German.This property is useful for building machine translation systems as well as for human readers who are either learning new languages or analyzing texts in languages they do not know.No paper is exactly comparable to any other paper  but they are all roughly topically similar.Restricting the query/target pairs to only those with query and target documents that are both longer than 50 words results in significant improvement and reduced variance: the average proportion of query documents for which the true translation is ranked highest goes from 53.9% to 72.7%.When applied to comparable document collections such as Wikipedia  PLTM supports data-driven analysis of differences and similarities across all languages for readers who understand any one language.We evaluate sets of high-probability words in each topic and multilingual “synsets” by comparing them to entries in human-constructed bilingual dictionaries  as done by Haghighi et al. (2008).We use this corpus to explore the ability of the model both to infer similarities between vocabularies in different languages  and to detect differences in topic emphasis between languages.Although the PLTM is clearly not a substitute for a machine translation system—it has no way to represent syntax or even multi-word phrases—it is clear from the examples in figure 2 that the sets of high probability words in different languages for a given topic are likely to include translations.Topic models have been used for analyzing topic trends in research literature (Mann et al.  2006; Hall et al.  2008)  inferring captions for images (Blei and Jordan  2003)  social network analysis in email (McCallum et al.  2005)  and expanding queries with topically related words in information retrieval (Wei and Croft  2006).Ideally  the “glue” documents in g will be sufficient to align the topics across languages  and will cause comparable documents in S to have similar distributions over topics even though they are modeled independently.We then add the Cartesian product of these sets for every topic to a set of candidate translations C. We report the number of elements of C that appear in the reference lexica.To evaluate this scenario  we train PLTM on a set of document tuples from EuroParl  infer topic distributions for a set of held-out documents  and then measure our ability to align documents in one language with their translations in another language.Finally  for each pair of languages (“query” and “target”) we calculate the difference between the topic distribution for each held-out document in the query language and the topic distribution for each held-out document in the target language.Gibbs sampling involves sequentially resampling each zln from its conditional posterior: where z\l n is the current set of topic assignments for all other tokens in the tuple  while (Nt)\l n is the number of occurrences of topic t in the tuple  excluding zln  the variable being resampled.If we wish to perform topic-based bibliometric analysis  it is vital to be able to track the same topics across all languages.An important application for polylingual topic modeling is to use small numbers of comparable document tuples to link topics in larger collections of distinct  non-comparable documents in multiple languages.We are therefore interested in determining whether the information in the document-specific topic distributions is sufficient to identify semantically identical documents.We analyzed the characteristics of PLTM in comparison to monolingual LDA  and demonstrated that it is possible to discover aligned topics.To perform topic-based bibliometric analysis on these collections  it is necessary to have topic models that are aligned across languages.For each document in the query language we rank all documents in the target language and record the rank of the actual translation.The higher the probability of the held-out document tuples  the better the generalization ability of the model.To demonstrate the wide variation in topics  we calculated the proportion of tokens in each language assigned to each topic.Maximum topic probability in document Although the posterior distribution over topics for each tuple is not concentrated on one topic  it is worth checking that this is not simply because the model is assigning a single topic to the 1We use the R density function. tokens in each of the languages.To do this  we divide the corpus W into two sets of document tuples: a “glue” set G and a “separate” set S such that |G |/ |W |= p. In other words  the proportion of tuples in the corpus that are treated as “glue” (i.e.  placed in G) is p. For every tuple in S  we assign each document in that tuple to a new singledocument tuple.We calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the topic distributions for each pair of individual documents in S that were originally part of the same tuple prior to separation.We then use this model to infer topic distributions for each of the 11 documents in each of the held-out document tuples using a method similar to that used to calculate held-out probabilities (Wallach et al.  2009).Polylingual Topic ModelsWe therefore evaluate the ability of the PLTM to generate bilingual lexica  similar to other work in unsupervised translation modeling (Haghighi et al.  2008).Outside of the field of topic modeling  Kawaba et al. (Kawaba et al.  2008) use a Wikipedia-based model to perform sentiment analysis of blog posts.As the number of topics is increased  the word counts per topic become very sparse in monolingual LDA models  proportional to the size of the vocabulary.We take a simpler approach that is more suitable for topically similar document tuples (where documents are not direct translations of one another) in more than two languages.Rather  these results are intended as a quantitative analysis of the difference between the two models.This result is important: informally  we have found that increasing the granularity of topics correlates strongly with user perceptions of the utility of a topic model.In contrast  PLTM assigns a significant number of tokens to almost all 800 topics  in very similar proportions in both languages.Figure 5 shows the proportion of all tokens in English and Finnish assigned to each topic under LDA and PLTM with 800 topics.Table 2 shows the log probability of held-out data in nats per word for PLTM and LDA  both trained with 200 topics.Bilingual topic models for parallel texts with word-to-word alignments have been studied previously using the HM-bitam model (Zhao and Xing  2007).Topic models are a useful tool for analyzing large text collections  but have previously been applied in only monolingual  or at most bilingual  contexts.By linking topics across languages  polylingual topic models can increase cross-cultural understanding by providing readers with the ability to characterize the contents of collections in unfamiliar languages and identify trends in topic prevalence.These results demonstrate that PLTM is appropriate for aligning topics in corpora that have only a small subset of comparable documents.Although the model does not distinguish between topic assignment variables within a given document tuple (so it is technically incorrect to speak of different posterior distributions over topics for different documents in a given tuple)  we can nevertheless divide topic assignment variables between languages and use them to estimate a Dirichlet-multinomial posterior distribution for each language in each tuple.The vast majority of divergences are relatively low (1.0 indicates no overlap in topics between languages in a given document tuple) indicating that  for each tuple  the model is not simply assigning all tokens in a particular language to a single topic.If the model assigns all tokens in a tuple to a single topic  the maximum posterior topic probability for that tuple will be near to 1.0.
