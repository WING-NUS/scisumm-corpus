Since all long sentence translation are somewhat muddled  even a contrastive evaluation between systems was difficult.The sign test checks  how likely a sample of better and worse BLEU scores would have been generated by two systems of equal performance.This is can not be the only explanation  since the discrepancy still holds  for instance  for out-of-domain French-English  where Systran receives among the best adequacy and fluency scores  but a worse BLEU score than all but one statistical system.On the other hand  when all systems produce muddled output  but one is better  and one is worse  but not completely wrong  a judge is inclined to hand out judgements of 4  3  and 2.Because of this  we retokenized and lowercased submitted output with our own tokenizer  which was also used to prepare the training and test data.Not every annotator was fluent in both the source and the target language.By taking the ratio of matching n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the system output  we obtain the precision pn for each n-gram order n. These values for n-gram precision are combined into a BLEU score: The formula for the BLEU metric also includes a brevity penalty for too short output  which is based on the total number of words in the system output c and in the reference r. BLEU is sensitive to tokenization.The scores and confidence intervals are detailed first in the Figures 7–10 in table form (including ranks)  and then in graphical form in Figures 11–16.For the manual scoring  we can distinguish only half of the systems  both in terms of fluency and adequacy.In addition to the Europarl test set  we also collected 29 editorials from the Project Syndicate website2  which are published in all the four languages of the shared task.The results of the manual and automatic evaluation of the participating system translations is detailed in the figures at the end of this paper.While we used the standard metrics of the community  the we way presented translations and prompted for assessment differed from other evaluation campaigns.For more on the participating systems  please refer to the respective system description in the proceedings of the workshop.Another way to view the judgements is that they are less quality judgements of machine translation systems per se  but rankings of machine translation systems.Hence  the different averages of manual scores for the different language pairs reflect the behaviour of the judges  not the quality of the systems on different language pairs.Presenting the output of several system allows the human judge to make more informed judgements  contrasting the quality of the different systems.The confidence intervals are computed by bootstrap resampling for BLEU  and by standard significance testing for the manual scores  as described earlier in the paper.We confirm the finding by Callison-Burch et al. (2006) that the rule-based system of Systran is not adequately appreciated by BLEU.This is demonstrated by average scores over all systems  in terms of BLEU  fluency and adequacy  as displayed in Figure 5.Almost all annotators reported difficulties in maintaining a consistent standard for fluency and adequacy judgements  but nevertheless most did not explicitly move towards a ranking-based evaluation.The bootstrap method has been critized by Riezler and Maxwell (2005) and Collins et al. (2005)  as being too optimistic in deciding for statistical significant difference between systems.The human judges were presented with the following definition of adequacy and fluency  but no additional instructions:Given a set of n sentences  we can compute the sample mean x� and sample variance s2 of the individual sentence judgements xi: The extend of the confidence interval [x−d  x+df can be computed by d = 1.96 ·�n (6) Pairwise Comparison: As for the automatic evaluation metric  we want to be able to rank different systems against each other  for which we need assessments of statistical significance on the differences between a pair of systems.To check for this  we do pairwise bootstrap resampling: Again  we repeatedly sample sets of sentences  this time from both systems  and compare their BLEU scores on these sets.Pairwise comparison: We can use the same method to assess the statistical significance of one system outperforming another.We divide up each test set into blocks of 20 sentences (100 blocks for the in-domain test set  53 blocks for the out-of-domain test set)  check for each block  if one system has a higher BLEU score than the other  and then use the sign test.At first glance  we quickly recognize that many systems are scored very similar  both in terms of manual judgement and BLEU.It was our hope that this competition  which included the manual and automatic evaluation of statistical systems and one rulebased commercial system  will give further insight into the relation between automatic and manual evaluation.For instance: if 10 systems participate  and one system does better than 3 others  worse then 2  and is not significant different from the remaining 4  its rank is in the interval 3–7.Given the closeness of most systems and the wide over-lapping confidence intervals it is hard to make strong statements about the correlation between human judgements and automatic scoring methods such as BLEU.While automatic measures are an invaluable tool for the day-to-day development of machine translation systems  they are only a imperfect substitute for human assessment of translation quality  or as the acronym BLEU puts it  a bilingual evaluation understudy.Annotators argued for the importance of having correct and even multiple references.Training and testing is based on the Europarl corpus.We are currently working on a complete open source implementation of a training and decoding system  which should become available over the summer. pus  from which also the in-domain test set is taken.The evaluation framework for the shared task is similar to the one used in last year’s shared task.While building a machine translation system is a serious undertaking  in future we hope to attract more newcomers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry as low as possible.To summarize  we provided: The performance of the baseline system is similar to the best submissions in last year’s shared task.For instance  in the recent IWSLT evaluation  first fluency annotations were solicited (while withholding the source sentence)  and then adequacy annotations.
