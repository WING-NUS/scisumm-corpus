Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. demand for very large corpora.  efficiency of annotation is an important. criterion for the success of the developed methodology and tools.Because of the intended theory-independence of the scheme  we annotate only the common minimum.Accuracy of the unreliable 10% of assignments is 75%  i.e.  the annotator has to alter the choice in 1 of 4 cases when asked for confirmation.In addition the approach provides empirical material for psycholinguistic investigation  since preferences for the choice of certain syntactic constructions  linea.rizations  and attachments that have been observed in online experiments of language production and comprehension can now be put in relation with the frequency of these alternatives in larger amounts of texts.We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation.For the implementation  we used Tcl/Tk Version 4.1.For instance  the first  determiner among the NK's can be treated as the specifier of the phrase.Moreover  the so-called DP analysis views the article der as the head of the phrase.This amount of data suffices as training material to reliably assign the grammatical functions if the user determines the elements of a phrase and its type (step 1 of the list above).For evaluation  the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets  one for training (90% of the corpus)  the other one for testing (10%).Due to the rudimentary character of the argument structure representations  a great deal of information has to be expressed by grammatical functions.If the scope of such a word does not directly correspond to a tree node  the word is attached to the lowest node dominating all subconstituents appearing in its scope.As the need for certain functionalities becomes obvious with growing annotation experience  we have decided to implement the tool in two stages.Owing to the partial automation  the average annotation efficiency improves by 25% (from around 4 minutes to 3 minutes per sentence).In such cases  an additional edge is drawn from the embedded VP node to the controller  thus changing the syntactic tree into a graph.In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30 000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created.Since the requirements for such a formalism differ from those posited for configurational languages  several features have been added  influencing the architecture of the scheme.During the first phase  the focus is on annotating correct structures and a coarse-grained classification of grammatical functions  which represent the following areas of information: Dependency type: complements are further classified according to features such as category and case: clausal complements (OC)  accusative objects (OA)  datives (DA)  etc.The implementation of the first phase as described in the following paragraphs is completed.To keep the human annotator from missing errors made by the tagger  we additionally calculate the strongest competitor for each label G. If its probability is close to the winner (closeness is defined by a threshold on the quotient)  the assignment is regarded as unreliable  and the annotator is asked to confirm the assignment.The difference between the particular NK's lies in the positional and part-of-speech information  which is also sufficient to recover theory-specific structures from our `underspecified' representations.In the first phase  the main functionality for building and displaying unordered trees is supplied.The underlying argument SirlteilITC is not represented directly  but can be recovered from the tree and trace-filler annotations.However  there is a trade-off between the granularity of information encoded in the labels and the speed and accuracy of annotation.Since a precise structural description of non-constituent coordination would require a. rich inventory of incomplete phrase types  we have agreed on a sort of unde.rspe.cified representations: the coordinated units are assigned structures in which missing lexical material is not represented at the level of primary links.In the following paragraphs  we give annotations for a number of such phenomena..The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks') for stochastic grammar induction.The subject is itself a sentence in which the copula (zA) does occur and is assigned the tag HD'.In addition  we have adopted a simple convention for those cases in which context information is insufficient  for total disambiguation: the highest possible attachment  site is chosen.While in the first phase each annotator has to annotate structures as well as categories and functions  the refinement call be done separately for each representation level.The following commands are available: The three tagsets used by the annotation tool (for words  phrases  and edges) are variable and are stored together with the corpus.A problem for the rudimentary argument. structure representations is the use of incomplete structures in natural language  i.e. phenomena such as coordination and ellipsis.
