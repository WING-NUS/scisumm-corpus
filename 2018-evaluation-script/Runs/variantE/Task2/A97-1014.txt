The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks') for stochastic grammar induction.During the second annotation stage  the annotation is enriched with information about thematic roles  quantifier scope and anaphoric reference.PM stands for morphological particle  a label for German infinitival Z7t and superlative am.The following commands are available: The three tagsets used by the annotation tool (for words  phrases  and edges) are variable and are stored together with the corpus.We have argued that the selected approach is better suited for producing high quality interpreted corpora in languages exhibiting free constituent order.Separable verb prefixes are labeled SVP.Grammatical functions  encoded in edge labels  e.g.For the implementation  we used Tcl/Tk Version 4.1.We distinguish the following levels of representation: 'A context-free constituent backbone can still be recovered from the surface string and argument structure by reattaching 'extracted' structures to a higher node.During annotation  the highest rated grammatical function labels Gi are calculated using the Viterbi algorithm and assigned to the structure  i.e.  we calculate argma.x11 PQ (Ti 1Z-1  Ti.-2) PQ (Gi ITi).In the second phase  secondary links and additional structural functions are supported.The corpus is stored in a SQL database.This extra marking makes it easy to distinguish between 'normal' and coordinated categories.In addition  a. number of clear-cut NP cornponents can be defined outside that  juxtapositional kernel: pre- and postnominal genitives (GL  GR)  relative clauses (RC)  clausal and sentential complements (OC).During the first phase  the focus is on annotating correct structures and a coarse-grained classification of grammatical functions  which represent the following areas of information: Dependency type: complements are further classified according to features such as category and case: clausal complements (OC)  accusative objects (OA)  datives (DA)  etc.In the first phase  the main functionality for building and displaying unordered trees is supplied.A uniform representation of local and non-local dependencies makes the structure more transparent'.A tree meeting these requirements is given below: Adv V NP NP V CPL NP V damn wird ihn Anna erkennen  dais er 'vein!The development of linguistically interpreted corpora presents a laborious and time-consuming task.The tree resembles traditional constituent structures.Corpora annotated with syntactic structures are commonly referred to as trctbank.5.The resulting scheme reflects a stratificational notion of language  and makes only minimal assumpabout the interrelation of the particu- â€¢lar representational strata.As theory-independence is one of our objectives  the annotation scheme incorporates a number of widely accepted linguistic analyses  especially in the area of verbal  adverbial and adjectival syntax.In particular  we focus on several methodological issues concerning the annotation of non-configurational languages.As modern linguistics is also becoming more aware of the importance of larger sets of naturally occurring data.  interpreted corpora. are a. valuable resource for theoretical and descriptive linguistic research.We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation.All components of this kernel are assigned the label NK and treated as sibling nodes.
