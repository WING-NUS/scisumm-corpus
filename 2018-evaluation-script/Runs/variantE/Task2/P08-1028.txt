Importantly  additive models capture composition by considering all vector components representing the meaning of the verb and its subject  whereas multiplicative models consider a subset  namely non-zero components.Following previous work (Bullinaria and Levy  2007)  we optimized its parameters on a word-based semantic similarity task.Our work proposes a framework for vector composition which allows the derivation of different types of models and licenses two fundamental composition operations  multiplication and addition (and their combination).Noisy versions of the original vectors can be recovered by means of circular correlation which is the approximate inverse of circular convolution.Secondly  we optimized the weightings in the combined model (11) with a similar grid search over its three parameters.We define a general class of models for this process of composition as: The expression above allows us to derive models for which p is constructed in a distinct space from u and v  as is the case for tensor products.It also allows us to derive models in which composition makes use of background knowledge K and models in which composition has a dependence  via the argument R  on syntax.Moreover  the vector similarities within such semantic spaces have been shown to substantially correlate with human similarity judgments (McDonald  2000) and word association norms (Denhire and Lemaire  2004).Specifically  they belonged to different synsets and were maximally dissimilar as measured by the Jiang and Conrath (1997) measure.3 Our initial set of candidate materials consisted of 20 verbs  each paired with 10 nouns  and 2 landmarks (400 pairs of sentences in total).The projection is defined in terms of circular convolution a mathematical function that compresses the tensor product of two vectors.The task involves examining the degree of linear relationship between the human judgments for two individual words and vector-based similarity values.To overcome this problem  other techniques have been proposed in which the binding of two vectors results in a vector which has the same dimensionality as its components.Specifically  m was set to 20 and m to 1.This yielded a weighted sum consisting of 95% verb  0% noun and 5% of their multiplicative combination.Smolensky (1990) proposed the use of tensor products as a means of binding one vector to another.We formulated composition as a function of two vectors and introduced several models based on addition and multiplication.This yielded a reduced set of experimental items (120 in total) consisting of 15 reference verbs  each with 4 nouns  and 2 landmarks.Vector-based Models of Semantic CompositionWe experimented with a variety of dimensions (ranging from 50 to 500 000)  vector component definitions (e.g.  pointwise mutual information or log likelihood ratio) and similarity measures (e.g.  cosine or confusion probability).We intend to assess the potential of our composition models on context sensitive semantic priming (Till et al.  1988) and inductive inference (Heit and Rubinstein  1994).For the hierarchical structure of natural language this binding problem becomes particularly acute.Any adequate model of composition must be able to represent argument-verb meaning.This paper proposes a framework for representing the meaning of phrases and sentences in vector space.In this paper we examine models of semantic composition that are empirically grounded and can represent similarity relations.For example  assuming that individual words are represented by vectors  we can compute the meaning of a sentence by taking their mean (Foltz et al.  1998; Landauer and Dumais  1997).Under this framework  we introduce a wide range of composition models which we evaluate empirically on a sentence similarity task.Materials and Design Our materials consisted of sentences with an an intransitive verb and its subject.Holographic reduced representations (Plate  1991) are one implementation of this idea where the tensor product is projected back onto the space of its components.The compression is achieved by summing along the transdiagonal elements of the tensor product.We obtained best results with a model using a context window of five words on either side of the target word  the cosine measure  and 2 000 vector components.These included three additive models  i.e.  simple addition (equation (5)  Add)  weighted addition (equation (7)  WeightAdd)  and Kintsch’s (2001) model (equation (10)  Kintsch)  a multiplicative model (equation (6)  Multiply)  and also a model which combines multiplication with addition (equation (11)  Combined).The tensor product u ® v is a matrix whose components are all the possible products uivj of the components of vectors u and v. A major difficulty with tensor products is their dimensionality which is higher than the dimensionality of the original vectors (precisely  the tensor product has dimensionality m x n).Specifically  we considered eleven models  varying in their weightings  in steps of 10%  from 100% noun through 50% of both verb and noun to 100% verb.In addition  Bullinaria and Levy (2007) found that these parameters perform well on a number of other tasks such as the synonymy task from the Test ofEnglish as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).A more scrupulous evaluation requires directly correlating all the individual participants’ similarity judgments with those of the models.6 We used Spearman’s p for our correlation analyses.The difference between High and Low similarity values estimated by these models are statistically significant (p < 0.01 using the Wilcoxon rank sum test).Experimental results demonstrate that the multiplicative models are superior to the additive alternatives when compared against human judgments.Analysis of Similarity Ratings The reliability of the collected judgments is important for our evaluation experiments; we therefore performed several tests to validate the quality of the ratings.Each cell recorded the number of times our subjects selected the landmark as compatible with the noun or not.A Wilcoxon rank sum test confirmed that the difference is statistically significant (p < 0.01).This configuration gave high correlations with the WordSim353 similarity judgments using the cosine measure.Model similarities have been estimated using cosine which ranges from 0 to 1  whereas our subjects rated the sentences on a scale from 1 to 7.Central to our approach is vector composition which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions.The semantic space we used in our experiments was built on a lemmatised version of the BNC.The weighted additive model (p = 0.09) is not significantly different from the baseline either or Kintsch (2001) (p = 0.09).
