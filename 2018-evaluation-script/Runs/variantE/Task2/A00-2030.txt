Finally  our newly constructed parser  like that of (Collins 1997)  was based on a generative statistical model.By necessity  we adopted the strategy of hand marking only the semantics.The next steps are to generate in order: In this case  there are none.Post-modifier constituents for the PER/NP.We now briefly summarize the probability structure of the model.The detailed probability structure differs  however  in that it was designed to jointly perform part-of-speech tagging  name finding  syntactic parsing  and relation finding in a single process.We evaluated part-of-speech tagging and parsing accuracy on the Wall Street Journal using a now standard procedure (see Collins 97)  and evaluated name finding accuracy on the MUC7 named entity test.Finally  word features  fm  for modifiers are predicted based on the modifier  cm  the partof-speech tag of the modifier word   t„„ the part-of-speech tag of the head word th  the head word itself  wh  and whether or not the modifier head word  w„„ is known or unknown.For example  the coreference relation between &quot;Nance&quot; and &quot;a paid consultant to ABC News&quot; is indicated by &quot;per-desc-of.&quot; In this case  because the argument does not connect directly to the relation  the intervening nodes are labeled with semantics &quot;-ptr&quot; to indicate the connection.Although each model differed in its detailed probability structure  we believed that the essential elements of all three models could be generalized in a single probability model.Our integrated model represents syntax and semantics jointly using augmented parse trees.To train our integrated model  we required a large corpus of augmented parse trees.Word features are introduced primarily to help with unknown words  as in (Weischedel et al. 1993).In this paper we report adapting a lexic al ized  probabilistic context-free parser to information extraction and evaluate this new technique on MUC-7 template elements and template relations.An integrated model can limit the propagation of errors by making all decisions jointly.For modifier constituents  the mixture components are: For part-of-speech tags  the mixture components are: Finally  for word features  the mixture components are:The categories for head constituents  cl„ are predicted based solely on the category of the parent node  cp: Modifier constituent categories  cm  are predicted based on their parent node  cp  the head constituent of their parent node  chp  the previously generated modifier  c„ _1  and the head word of their parent  wp.A Novel Use of Statistical Parsing to Extract Information from TextIn our statistical model  trees are generated according to a process similar to that described in (Collins 1996  1997).This generation process is continued until the entire tree has been produced.The probability of a complete tree is the product of the probabilities of generating each element in the tree.For purposes of pruning  and only for purposes of pruning  the prior probability of each constituent category is multiplied by the generative probability of that constituent (Goodman  1997).Initially  we tried to annotate the training corpus by hand marking  for each sentence  the entire augmented tree.David Edwin Lewis &quot; a node is inserted to indicate that &quot;Lt. Cmdr.&quot; is a descriptor for &quot;David Edwin Lewis.&quot; 5.These steps are given below:We were able to use the Penn TREEBANK to estimate the syntactic parameters; no additional syntactic training was required.Given a new sentence  the outcome of this search process is a tree structure that encodes both the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentence.Technical agents for part of this work were Fort Huachucha and AFRL under contract numbers DABT63-94-C-0062  F30602-97-C-0096  and 4132-BBN-001.To produce a corpus of augmented parse trees  we used the following multi-step training procedure which exploited the Penn TREEBANK Applying this procedure yielded a new version of the semantically annotated corpus  now annotated with complete augmented trees like that in Figure 3.Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages  we were optimistic that some of their properties — especially their ability to learn from large amounts of data  and their robustness when presented with unexpected inputs — would also benefit semantic analysis.Currently  the prevailing architecture for dividing sentential processing is a four-stage pipeline consisting of: Since we were interested in exploiting recent advances in parsing  replacing the syntactic analysis stage of the standard pipeline with a modern statistical parser was an obvious possibility.A single model proved capable of performing all necessary sentential processing  both syntactic and semantic.We evaluated the new approach to information extraction on two of the tasks of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) and reported in (Marsh  1998).We were already using a generative statistical model for part-of-speech tagging (Weischedel et al. 1993)  and more recently  had begun using a generative statistical model for name finding (Bikel et al.syntactic modifier of the other  the inserted node serves to indicate the relation as well as the argument.For each constituent  the head is generated first  followed by the modifiers  which are generated from the head outward.The technique was benchmarked in the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) in 1998.
