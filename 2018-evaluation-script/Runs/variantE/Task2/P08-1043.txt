Cohen and Smith approach this by introducing the α hyperparameter  which performs best when optimized independently for each sentence (cf.This is akin to PoS tags sequences induced by different parses in the setup familiar from English and explored in e.g.A morphological analyzer M : W—* L is a function mapping sentences in Hebrew (W E W) to their corresponding lattices (M(W) = L E L).Using a wide-coverage morphological analyzer based on (Itai et al.  2006) should cater for a better coverage  and incorporating lexical probabilities learned from a big (unannotated) corpus (cf.Inflectional features marking pronominal elements may be attached to different kinds of categories marking their pronominal complements.The addition of vertical markovization enables non-pruned models to outperform all previously reported re12Cohen and Smith (2007) make use of a parameter (α) which is tuned separately for each of the tasks.Segments with the same surface form but different PoS tags are treated as different lexemes  and are represented as separate arcs (e.g. the two arcs labeled neim from node 6 to 7).Morphological Analyzer Ideally  we would use an of-the-shelf morphological analyzer for mapping each input token to its possible analyses.This analyzer setting is similar to that of (Cohen and Smith  2007)  and models using it are denoted nohsp  Parser and Grammar We used BitPar (Schmid  2004)  an efficient general purpose parser 10 together with various treebank grammars to parse the input sentences and propose compatible morphological segmentation and syntactic analysis.Each connected path (l1 ... lk) E L corresponds to one morphological segmentation possibility of W. The Parser Given a sequence of input tokens W = w1 ... wn and a morphological analyzer  we look for the most probable parse tree π s.t.Tsarfaty (2006) used a morphological analyzer (Segal  2000)  a PoS tagger (Bar-Haim et al.  2005)  and a general purpose parser (Schmid  2000) in an integrated framework in which morphological and syntactic components interact to share information  leading to improved performance on the joint task.To evaluate the performance on the segmentation task  we report SEG  the standard harmonic means for segmentation Precision and Recall F1 (as defined in Bar-Haim et al. (2005); Tsarfaty (2006)) as well as the segmentation accuracy SEGTok measure indicating the percentage of input tokens assigned the correct exact segmentation (as reported by Cohen and Smith (2007)).In sequential tagging models such as (Adler and Elhadad  2006; Bar-Haim et al.  2007; Smith et al.  2005) weights are assigned according to a language model The input for the joint task is a sequence W = w1  ...   wn of space-delimited tokens.A Single Generative Model for Joint Morphological Segmentation and Syntactic ParsingFor brevity we omit the segments from the analysis  and so analysis of the form “fmnh” as f/REL mnh/VB is represented simply as REL VB.This fully generative model caters for real interaction between the syntactic and morphological levels as a part of a single coherent process.Previous work on morphological and syntactic disambiguation in Hebrew used different sets of data  different splits  differing annotation schemes  and different evaluation measures.We represent all morphological analyses of a given utterance using a lattice structure.The input for the segmentation task is however highly ambiguous for Semitic languages  and surface forms (tokens) may admit multiple possible analyses as in (BarHaim et al.  2007; Adler and Elhadad  2006).The remaining arcs are marked OOV.The joint morphological and syntactic hypothesis was first discussed in (Tsarfaty  2006; Tsarfaty and Sima’an  2004) and empirically explored in (Tsarfaty  2006).Cohen and Smith (2007) followed up on these results and proposed a system for joint inference of morphological and syntactic structures using factored models each designed and trained on its own.
