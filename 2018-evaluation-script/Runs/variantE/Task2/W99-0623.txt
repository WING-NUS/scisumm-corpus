Both of the switching techniques  as well as the parametric hybridization technique were also shown to be robust when a poor parser was introduced into the experiments.All four of the techniques studied result in parsing systems that perform better than any previously reported.These two principles guide experimentation in this framework  and together with the evaluation measures help us decide which specific type of substructure to combine.F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall  2PR/(P + R).The combining technique must act as a multi-position switch indicating which parser should be trusted for the particular sentence.The second row is the accuracy of the best of the three parsers.'We pick the parse that is most similar to the other parses by choosing the one with the highest sum of pairwise similarities.The set is then compared with the set generated from the Penn Treebank parse to determine the precision and recall.We have presented two general approaches to studying parser combination: parser switching and parse hybridization.This is the parse that is closest to the centroid of the observed parses under the similarity metric.For example  one parser could be more accurate at predicting noun phrases than the other parsers.Another technique for parse hybridization is to use a naïve Bayes classifier to determine which constituents to include in the parse.It is the performance we could achieve if an omniscient observer told us which parser to pick for each of the sentences.If enough parsers suggest that a particular constituent belongs in the parse  we include it.Under certain conditions the constituent voting and naïve Bayes constituent combination techniques are guaranteed to produce sets of constituents with no crossing brackets.One hybridization strategy is to let the parsers vote on constituents' membership in the hypothesized set.The constituent voting and naïve Bayes techniques are equivalent because the parameters learned in the training set did not sufficiently discriminate between the three parsers.IL+-1Proof: Assume a pair of crossing constituents appears in the output of the constituent voting technique using k parsers.Each of the constituents must have received at least 1 votes from the k parsers  so a > I1 and 2 — 2k±-1 b > ri-5-111.We are interested in combining the substructures of the input parses to produce a better parse.The Bayes models were able to achieve significantly higher precision than their non-parametric counterparts.It was then tested on section 22 of the Treebank in conjunction with the other parsers.The counts represent portions of the approximately 44000 constituents hypothesized by the parsers in the development set.The results of this experiment can be seen in Table 5.The PCFG was trained from the same sections of the Penn Treebank as the other three parsers.Three state-of-the-art statistical parsers are combined to produce more accurate parses  as well as new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy.We have developed a general approach for combining parsers when preserving the entire structure of a parse tree is important.The corpus-based statistical parsing community has many fast and accurate automated parsing systems  including systems produced by Collins (1997)  Charniak (1997) and Ratnaparkhi (1997).One can trivially create situations in which strictly binary-branching trees are combined to create a tree with only the root node and the terminal nodes  a completely flat structure.Parser 3  the most accurate parser  was chosen 71% of the time  and Parser 1  the least accurate parser was chosen 16% of the time.For each experiment we gave an nonparametric and a parametric technique for combining parsers.This drastic tree manipulation is not appropriate for situations in which we want to assign particular structures to sentences.There is a guarantee of no crossing brackets but there is no guarantee that a constituent in the tree has the same children as it had in any of the three original parses.This technique has the advantage of requiring no training  but it has the disadvantage of treating all parsers equally even though they may have differing accuracies or may specialize in modeling different phenomena.The parser switching oracle is the upper bound on the accuracy that can be achieved on this set in the parser switching framework.In the interest of testing the robustness of these combining techniques  we added a fourth  simple nonlexicalized PCFG parser.Similar advances have been made in machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg  1994)  speech recognition (Fiscus  1997) and named entity recognition (Borthwick et al.  1998).Recently  combination techniques have been investigated for part of speech tagging with positive results (van Halteren et al.  1998; Brill and Wu  1998).
