We evaluate sets of high-probability words in each topic and multilingual “synsets” by comparing them to entries in human-constructed bilingual dictionaries  as done by Haghighi et al. (2008).We explore the model’s characteristics using two large corpora  each with over ten different languages  and demonstrate its usefulness in supporting machine translation and tracking topic trends across languages.Each lexicon is a set of pairs consisting of an English word and a translated word  1we  wt}.Although direct translations in multiple languages are relatively rare (in contrast with comparable documents)  we use direct translations to explore the characteristics of the model.The polylingual topic model (PLTM) is an extension of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al.  2003) for modeling polylingual document tuples.To evaluate this scenario  we train PLTM on a set of document tuples from EuroParl  infer topic distributions for a set of held-out documents  and then measure our ability to align documents in one language with their translations in another language.In addition to enhancing lexicons by aligning topic-specific vocabulary  PLTM may also be useful for adapting machine translation systems to new domains by finding translations or near translations in an unstructured corpus.Topic models have been used for analyzing topic trends in research literature (Mann et al.  2006; Hall et al.  2008)  inferring captions for images (Blei and Jordan  2003)  social network analysis in email (McCallum et al.  2005)  and expanding queries with topically related words in information retrieval (Wei and Croft  2006).Bilingual topic models for parallel texts with word-to-word alignments have been studied previously using the HM-bitam model (Zhao and Xing  2007).English and the Romance languages use only singular and plural versions of “objective.” The other Germanic languages include compound words  while Greek and Finnish are dominated by inflected variants of the same lexical item.Additionally  PLTM can support the creation of bilingual lexica for low resource language pairs  providing candidate translations for more computationally intense alignment processes without the sentence-aligned translations typically used in such tasks.We employ a set of direct translations  the EuroParl corpus  to evaluate whether PLTM can accurately infer topics when documents genuinely contain the same content.We take the latter approach  and use the MAP estimate for αm and the predictive distributions over words for Φ1  .Given a set of training document tuples  PLTM can be used to obtain posterior estimates of Φ'  ...   ΦL and αm.As noted before  many of the documents in the EuroParl collection consist of short  formulaic sentences.The remaining collection consists of over 121 million words.As with EuroParl  we can calculate the JensenShannon divergence between pairs of documents within a comparable document tuple.PLTM assumes that the documents in a tuple share the same tuple-specific distribution over topics.We use the “left-to-right” method of (Wallach et al.  2009).Results averaged over all query/target language pairs are shown in figure 7 for Jensen-Shannon divergence.To demonstrate the wide variation in topics  we calculated the proportion of tokens in each language assigned to each topic.Additionally  the predictive ability of PLTM is consistently slightly worse than that of (monolingual) LDA.To answer this question  we compute the posterior probability of each topic in each tuple under the trained model.We then use this model to infer topic distributions for each of the 11 documents in each of the held-out document tuples using a method similar to that used to calculate held-out probabilities (Wallach et al.  2009).  ΦL and αm from P(Φ1  ...   ΦL  αm  |W'  β) or by evaluating a point estimate.(Interestingly  all languages except Greek and Finnish use closely related words for “youth” or “young” in a separate topic.)This is unlike LDA  in which each document is assumed to have its own document-specific distribution over topics.Each tuple is a set of documents that are loosely equivalent to each other  but written in different languages  e.g.  corresponding Wikipedia articles in French  English and German.This topic provides an illustration of the variation in technical terminology captured by PLTM  including the wide array of acronyms used by different languages.We also do not count morphological variants: the model finds EN “rules” and DE “vorschriften ” but the lexicon contains only “rule” and “vorschrift.” Results remain strong as we increase K. With K = 3  T = 800  1349 of the 7200 candidate pairs for Spanish appeared in the lexicon. topic in different languages translations of each other?Additionally  PLTM assumes that each “topic” consists of a set of discrete distributions over words—one for each language l = 1  ...   L. In other words  rather than using a single set of topics Φ = {φ1  ...   φT}  as in LDA  there are L sets of language-specific topics  Φ1  ...   ΦL  each of which is drawn from a language-specific symmetric Dirichlet with concentration parameter βl.Although the model does not distinguish between topic assignment variables within a given document tuple (so it is technically incorrect to speak of different posterior distributions over topics for different documents in a given tuple)  we can nevertheless divide topic assignment variables between languages and use them to estimate a Dirichlet-multinomial posterior distribution for each language in each tuple.Anew document tuple w = (w1  ...   wL) is generated by first drawing a tuple-specific topic distribution from an asymmetric Dirichlet prior with concentration parameter α and base measure m: Then  for each language l  a latent topic assignment is drawn for each token in that language: Finally  the observed tokens are themselves drawn using the language-specific topic parameters: wl ∼ P(wl  |zl Φl) = 11n φlwl |zl .Our first set of experiments focuses on document tuples that are known to consist of direct translations.The third topic demonstrates differences in inflectional variation.We analyzed the characteristics of PLTM in comparison to monolingual LDA  and demonstrated that it is possible to discover aligned topics.We therefore evaluate the ability of the PLTM to generate bilingual lexica  similar to other work in unsupervised translation modeling (Haghighi et al.  2008).These aligned document pairs could then be fed into standard machine translation systems as training data.These tasks can either be accomplished by averaging over samples of Φ1  .We perform five estimation runs for each document and then calculate standard errors using a bootstrap method.The EuroParl corpus consists of parallel texts in eleven western European languages: Danish  German  Greek  English  Spanish  Finnish  French  Italian  Dutch  Portuguese and Swedish.Results vary by language.By linking topics across languages  polylingual topic models can increase cross-cultural understanding by providing readers with the ability to characterize the contents of collections in unfamiliar languages and identify trends in topic prevalence.The vast majority of divergences are relatively low (1.0 indicates no overlap in topics between languages in a given document tuple) indicating that  for each tuple  the model is not simply assigning all tokens in a particular language to a single topic.From the results in figure 4  we know that leaving all document tuples intact should result in a mean JS divergence of less than 0.1.
