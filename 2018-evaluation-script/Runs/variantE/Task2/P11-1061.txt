Syntactic universals are a well studied concept in linguistics (Carnie  2002; Newmeyer  2005)  and were recently used in similar form by Naseem et al. (2010) for multilingual grammar induction.Note that since all English vertices were extracted from the parallel text  we will have an initial label distribution for all vertices in Ve.In the label propagation stage  we propagate the automatic English tags to the aligned Italian trigram types  followed by further propagation solely among the Italian vertices. the Italian vertices are connected to an automatically labeled English vertex.The foreign language vertices (denoted by Vf) correspond to foreign trigram types  exactly as in Subramanya et al. (2010).Our results suggest that it is possible to learn accurate POS taggers for languages which do not have any annotated data  but have translations into a resource-rich language.As discussed in more detail in §3  we use two types of vertices in our graph: on the foreign language side vertices correspond to trigram types  while the vertices on the English side are individual word types.For each language under consideration  Petrov et al. (2011) provide a mapping A from the fine-grained language specific POS tags in the foreign treebank to the universal POS tags.To initialize the graph we tag the English side of the parallel text using a supervised model.We utilized two kinds of datasets in our experiments: (i) monolingual treebanks9 and (ii) large amounts of parallel text with English on one side.Central to our approach (see Algorithm 1) is a bilingual similarity graph built from a sentence-aligned parallel corpus.To this end  we construct a bilingual graph over word types to establish a connection between the two languages (§3)  and then use graph label propagation to project syntactic information from English to the foreign language (§4).We use graph-based label propagation for cross-lingual knowledge transfer and use the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (Berg- Kirkpatrick et al.  2010).Because we don’t have a separate development set  we used the training set to select among them and found 0.2 to work slightly better than 0.1 and 0.3.To provide a thorough analysis  we evaluated three baselines and two oracles in addition to two variants of our graph-based approach.Given this similarity function  we define a nearest neighbor graph  where the edge weight for the n most similar vertices is set to the value of the similarity function and to 0 for all other vertices.We formulate the update as follows: where ∀ui ∈ Vf \ Vfl  γi(y) and κi are defined as: We ran this procedure for 10 iterations.The edge weights between the foreign language trigrams are computed using a co-occurence based similarity function  designed to indicate how syntactically similar the middle words of the connected trigrams are (§3.2).We use label propagation in two stages to generate soft labels on all the vertices in the graph.These tag distributions are used to initialize the label distributions over the English vertices in the graph.For a sentence x and a state sequence z  a first order Markov model defines a distribution: (9) where Val(X) corresponds to the entire vocabulary.We tried two versions of our graph-based approach: feature after the first stage of label propagation (Eq.The feature-based model replaces the emission distribution with a log-linear model  such that: on the word identity x  features checking whether x contains digits or hyphens  whether the first letter of x is upper case  and suffix features up to length 3.Since our graph is built from a parallel corpus  we can use standard word alignment techniques to align the English sentences De 5Note that many combinations are impossible giving a PMI value of 0; e.g.  when the trigram type and the feature instantiation don’t have words in common. and their foreign language translations Df.6 Label propagation in the graph will provide coverage and high recall  and we therefore extract only intersected high-confidence (> 0.9) alignments De�f.This formulation of the constraint feature is equivalent to the use of a tagging dictionary extracted from the graph using a threshold T on the posterior distribution of tags for a given word type (Eq.For English POS tagging  BergKirkpatrick et al. (2010) found that this direct gradient method performed better (>7% absolute accuracy) than using a feature-enhanced modification of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al.  1977).8 Moreover  this route of optimization outperformed a vanilla HMM trained with EM by 12%.To optimize this function  we used L-BFGS  a quasi-Newton method (Liu and Nocedal  1989).We define a symmetric similarity function K(uZ7 uj) over two foreign language vertices uZ7 uj E Vf based on the co-occurrence statistics of the nine feature concepts given in Table 1.The “No LP” model does not outperform direct projection for German and Greek  but performs better for six out of eight languages.Because we are interested in applying our techniques to languages for which no labeled resources are available  we paid particular attention to minimize the number of free parameters and used the same hyperparameters for all language pairs.We then extract a set of possible tags tx(y) by eliminating labels whose probability is below a threshold value τ: We describe how we choose τ in §6.4.In the first stage  we run a single step of label propagation  which transfers the label distributions from the English vertices to the connected foreign language vertices (say  Vf�) at the periphery of the graph.This feature ft incorporates information from the smoothed graph and prunes hidden states that are inconsistent with the thresholded vector tx.First  we use a novel graph-based framework for projecting syntactic information across language boundaries.Because the information flow in our graph is asymmetric (from English to the foreign language)  we use different types of vertices for each language.These universal POS categories not only facilitate the transfer of POS information from one language to another  but also relieve us from using controversial evaluation metrics 2 by establishing a direct correspondence between the induced hidden states in the foreign language and the observed English labels.To bridge this gap  we consider a practically motivated scenario  in which we want to leverage existing resources from a resource-rich language (like English) when building tools for resource-poor foreign languages.1 We assume that absolutely no labeled training data is available for the foreign language of interest  but that we have access to parallel data with a resource-rich language.To establish a soft correspondence between the two languages  we use a second similarity function  which leverages standard unsupervised word alignment statistics (§3.3).3 Since we have no labeled foreign data  our goal is to project syntactic information from the English side to the foreign side.Graph construction for structured prediction problems such as POS tagging is non-trivial: on the one hand  using individual words as the vertices throws away the context necessary for disambiguation; on the other hand  it is unclear how to define (sequence) similarity if the vertices correspond to entire sentences.In graph-based learning approaches one constructs a graph whose vertices are labeled and unlabeled examples  and whose weighted edges encode the degree to which the examples they link have the same label (Zhu et al.  2003).For graph propagation  the hyperparameter v was set to 2 x 10−6 and was not tuned.
