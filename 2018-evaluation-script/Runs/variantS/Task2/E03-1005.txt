Two apparently opposing DOP models exist in the literature: one which computes the parse tree involving the most frequent subtrees from a treebank and one which computes the parse tree involving the fewest subtrees from a treebank.The underlying idea of combining LikelihoodDOP and Simplicity-DOP is that the parser selects the simplest tree from among the n most probable trees  where n is a free parameter.While Goodman's method does still not allow for an efficient computation of the most probable parse in DOP1  it does efficiently compute the &quot;maximum constituents parse&quot;  i.e. the parse tree which is most likely to have the largest number of correct constituents.Note that Goodman's reduction method does still not allow for an efficient computation of the most probable parse tree of a sentence: there may still be exponentially many derivations generating the same tree.Sima'an (1995) gave an efficient algorithm for computing the parse tree generated by the most probable derivation  which in some cases is a reasonable approximation of the most probable parse.This paper proposes an integration of the two models which outperforms each of them separately.This suggests that a model which combines these two notions of best parse may boost the accuracy.In the second part of this paper  we extend our experiments with a new notion of the best parse tree.This paper presents the first published results with this estimator on the WSJ.Here we will only sketch this PCFG-reduction  which is heavily based on Goodman (2002).Together with a PCFGreduction of DOP we obtain improved accuracy and efficiency on the Wall Street Journal treebank Our results show an 11% relative reduction in error rate over previous models  and an average processing time of 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence.Although Bod's method obtains very competitive results on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) task  the parsing time was reported to be over 200 seconds per sentence (Bod 2003).While the PCFG reduction of Bod (2001) obtains state-of-the-art results on the WSJ  comparable to Charniak (2000)  Bonnema et al. 's estimator performs worse and is comparable to Collins (1996).Tested on the OVIS corpus  Bonnema et al. 's proposal obtains results that are comparable to Sima'an (1999) -- see Bonnema et al.This paper presents the first published results with Goodman's PCFG-reductions of both Bonnema et al. 's (1999) and Bod's (2001) estimators on the WSJ.The distinctive feature of the DOP approach when it was proposed in 1992 was to model sentence structures on the basis of previously observed frequencies of sentence structure fragments  without imposing any constraints on the size of these fragments.To appreciate these innovations  it should be noted that the model was radically different from all other statistical parsing models at the time.While SL-DOP and LS-DOP have been compared before in Bod (2002)  especially in the context of musical parsing  this paper presents the The DOP approach is based on two distinctive features: (1) the use of corpus fragments rather than grammar rules  and (2) the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones.Fragments include  for instance  subtrees of depth 1 (corresponding to context-free rules) as well as entire trees.Let a represent the number of subtrees headed by nodes with nonterminal A  that is a =Ej aj.Bod (1993) showed how standard parsing techniques can be applied to DOP1 by converting subtrees into rules.Next  the rank of each (shortest) derivation is computed as the sum of the ranks of the subtrees involved.Let aj represent the number of subtrees headed by the node A@j.While Bod (2001) needed to use a very large sample from the WSJ subtrees to do this  Goodman's method can do the same job with a more compact grammar.What is more important  is  that the best parse trees predicted by Simplicity-DOP are quite different from the best parse trees predicted by Likelihood-DOP.Other models started off with a predefined grammar and used a corpus only for estimating the rule probabilities (as e.g.Table 1 gives the results of these experiments and compares them with some other statistical parsers (resp.However  during the last few years we can observe a shift towards using more and larger corpus fragments with fewer restrictions.This innovation has not become generally adopted yet: many approaches still work either with local trees  i.e. single level rules with limited means of information percolation  or with restricted fragments  as in Stochastic Tree-Adjoining Grammar (Schabes 1992; Chiang 2000) that do not include nonlexicalized fragments.in Fujisaki et al. 1989; Black et al.Waegner 1992; Pereira and Schabes 1992).Most DOP models  such as in Bod (1993)  Goodman (1996)  Bonnema et al. (1997)  Sima'an (2000) and Collins & Duffy (2002)  use a likelihood criterion in defining the best parse tree: they take (some notion of) the most likely (i.e. most probable) tree as a candidate for the best tree of a sentence.Collins 1999; Charniak 2000; Goodman 1998).For our experiments we used the standard division of the WSJ (Marcus et al. 1993)  with sections 2 through 21 for training (approx.1992  1993; Briscoe and I Thanks to Ivan Sag for this pun.This may be explained by the fact our best results in Bod (2001) were obtained by testing various subtree restrictions until the highest accuracy was obtained  while in the current experiment we used all subtrees as given by the PCFG-reduction.Johnson (1998b  2002) showed that DOP1's subtree estimation method is statistically biased and inconsistent.Bonnema et al. (1999) observed that another problem with DOP1's subtree-estimation method is that it provides more probability to nodes with more subtrees  and therefore more probability to larger subtrees.Collins 1996  Charniak 1997  Collins 1999 and Charniak 2000).The DOP model  on the other hand  was the first model (to the best of our knowledge) that proposed not to train a predefined grammar on a corpus  but to directly use corpus fragments as a grammar.The other innovation of DOP was to take (in principle) all corpus fragments  of any size  rather than a small subset.We will refer to the first combination (which selects the simplest among the n likeliest trees) as Simplicity-Likelihood-DOP or SL-DOP  and to the second combination (which selects the likeliest among the n simplest trees) as Likelihood-Simplicity-DOP or LS-DOP.This approach has now gained wide usage  as exemplified by the work of Collins (1996  1999)  Charniak (1996  1997)  Johnson (1998)  Chiang (2000)  and many others.While the models of Collins (1996) and Eisner (1996) restricted the fragments to the locality of head-words  later models showed the importance of including context from higher nodes in the tree (Charniak 1997; Johnson 1998a).A disadvantage of this model is that an extremely large number of subtrees (and derivations) must be taken into account.Thus the major innovations of DOP are: 2. the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones Both have gained or are gaining wide usage  and are also becoming relevant for theoretical linguistics (see Bod et al. 2003a).As an alternative  Bonnema et al. (1999) propose a subtree estimator which reduces the probability of a tree by a factor of two for each non-root non-terminal it contains.Bonnema et al. (1999) show that as a consequence too much weight is given to larger subtrees  and that the parse accuracy of DOP1 deteriorates if (very) large subtrees are included.
