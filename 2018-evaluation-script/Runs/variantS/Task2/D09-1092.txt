Topic models are a useful tool for analyzing large text collections  but have previously been applied in only monolingual  or at most bilingual  contexts.Bilingual topic models for parallel texts with word-to-word alignments have been studied previously using the HM-bitam model (Zhao and Xing  2007).An important application for polylingual topic modeling is to use small numbers of comparable document tuples to link topics in larger collections of distinct  non-comparable documents in multiple languages.We also demonstrated that relatively small numbers of topically comparable document tuples are sufficient to align topics between languages in non-comparable corpora.These results demonstrate that PLTM is appropriate for aligning topics in corpora that have only a small subset of comparable documents.Meanwhile  massive collections of interlinked documents in dozens of languages  such as Wikipedia  are now widely available  calling for tools that can characterize content in many languages.However  the growth of the internet  and in particular Wikipedia  has made vast corpora of topically comparable texts—documents that are topically similar but are not direct translations of one another—considerably more abundant than ever before.However  the growth of the web  and in particular Wikipedia  has made comparable text corpora – documents that are topically similar but are not direct translations of one another – considerably more abundant than true parallel corpora.When applied to comparable document collections such as Wikipedia  PLTM supports data-driven analysis of differences and similarities across all languages for readers who understand any one language.We introduce a polylingual topic model that discovers topics aligned across multiple languages.We introduced a polylingual topic model (PLTM) that discovers topics aligned across multiple languages.In this paper  we use two polylingual corpora to answer various critical questions related to polylingual topic models.They also provide little analysis of the differences between polylingual and single-language topic models.We also explore how the characteristics of different languages affect topic model performance.We explore the model’s characteristics using two large corpora  each with over ten different languages  and demonstrate its usefulness in supporting machine translation and tracking topic trends across languages.We use this corpus to explore the ability of the model both to infer similarities between vocabularies in different languages  and to detect differences in topic emphasis between languages.We employ a set of direct translations  the EuroParl corpus  to evaluate whether PLTM can accurately infer topics when documents genuinely contain the same content.We demonstrate its utility and explore its characteristics using two polylingual corpora: proceedings of the European parliament (in eleven languages) and a collection of Wikipedia articles (in twelve languages).Statistical topic models have emerged as an increasingly useful analysis tool for large text collections.Previous work on bilingual topic modeling has focused on machine translation applications  which rely on sentence-aligned parallel translations.Topic models have been used for analyzing topic trends in research literature (Mann et al.  2006; Hall et al.  2008)  inferring captions for images (Blei and Jordan  2003)  social network analysis in email (McCallum et al.  2005)  and expanding queries with topically related words in information retrieval (Wei and Croft  2006).Tam  Lane and Schultz (Tam et al.  2007) also show improvements in machine translation using bilingual topic models.A recent extended abstract  developed concurrently by Ni et al. (Ni et al.  2009)  discusses a multilingual topic model similar to the one presented here.Much of this work  however  has occurred in monolingual contexts.As noted before  many of the documents in the EuroParl collection consist of short  formulaic sentences.In an increasingly connected world  the ability to access documents in many languages has become both a strategic asset and a personally enriching experience.The internet makes it possible for people all over the world to access documents from different cultures  but readers will not be fluent in this wide variety of languages.If we wish to perform topic-based bibliometric analysis  it is vital to be able to track the same topics across all languages.In this paper  we present the polylingual topic model (PLTM).In this section  we explore two questions relating to comparable text corpora and polylingual topic modeling.In order to simulate this scenario we create a set of variations of the EuroParl corpus by treating some documents as if they have no parallel/comparable texts – i.e.  we put each of these documents in a single-document tuple.There are many potential applications for polylingual topic models.Although research literature is typically written in English  bibliographic databases often contain substantial quantities of work in other languages.These versions of Wikipedia were selected to provide a diverse range of language families  geographic areas  and quantities of text.Such analysis could be significant in tracking international research trends  where language barriers slow the transfer of ideas.To perform topic-based bibliometric analysis on these collections  it is necessary to have topic models that are aligned across languages.We analyzed the characteristics of PLTM in comparison to monolingual LDA  and demonstrated that it is possible to discover aligned topics.First  we explore whether comparable document tuples support the alignment of fine-grained topics  as demonstrated earlier using parallel documents.In this case  we can be confident that the topic distribution is genuinely shared across all languages.The third topic demonstrates differences in inflectional variation.Our first set of experiments focuses on document tuples that are known to consist of direct translations.Although direct translations in multiple languages are relatively rare (in contrast with comparable documents)  we use direct translations to explore the characteristics of the model.The second corpus  Wikipedia articles in twelve languages  contains sets of documents that are not translations of one another  but are very likely to be about similar concepts.We argue that topic modeling is both a useful and appropriate tool for leveraging correspondences between semantically comparable documents in multiple different languages.To evaluate this scenario  we train PLTM on a set of document tuples from EuroParl  infer topic distributions for a set of held-out documents  and then measure our ability to align documents in one language with their translations in another language.We evaluate sets of high-probability words in each topic and multilingual “synsets” by comparing them to entries in human-constructed bilingual dictionaries  as done by Haghighi et al. (2008).
