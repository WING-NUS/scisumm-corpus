We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages.We have argued that the selected approach is better suited for producing high quality interpreted corpora in languages exhibiting free constituent order.Combining raw language data with linguistic information offers a promising basis for the development of new efficient and robust NLP methods.In particular  we focus on several methodological issues concerning the annotation of non-configurational languages.The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks') for stochastic grammar induction.Since the requirements for such a formalism differ from those posited for configurational languages  several features have been added  influencing the architecture of the scheme.The resulting scheme reflects a stratificational notion of language  and makes only minimal assumpabout the interrelation of the particu- â€¢lar representational strata.Due to the substantial differences between existing models of constituent structure  the question arises of how the theory independencf requirement  can be satisfied.The data-drivenness of this approach presents a clear advantage over the traditional  idealised notion of competence grammar.In addition the approach provides empirical material for psycholinguistic investigation  since preferences for the choice of certain syntactic constructions  linea.rizations  and attachments that have been observed in online experiments of language production and comprehension can now be put in relation with the frequency of these alternatives in larger amounts of texts.Since a precise structural description of non-constituent coordination would require a. rich inventory of incomplete phrase types  we have agreed on a sort of unde.rspe.cified representations: the coordinated units are assigned structures in which missing lexical material is not represented at the level of primary links.Apart from this rather technical problem  two further arguments speak against phrase structure as the structural pivot of the annotation scheme: Finally  the structural handling of free word order means stating well-formedness constraints on structures involving many trace-filler dependencies  which has proved tedious.During the first phase  the focus is on annotating correct structures and a coarse-grained classification of grammatical functions  which represent the following areas of information: Dependency type: complements are further classified according to features such as category and case: clausal complements (OC)  accusative objects (OA)  datives (DA)  etc.In section 2  we examine the appropriateness of existing annotation schemes.Section 4 deals with the treatment of selected phenomena.These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme.On the basis of these considerations  we formulate several additional requirements.In light of these facts  serious difficulties can be expected arising from the structural component of the existing formalisms.The head of the phrase can be determined in a similar way according to theory-specific assumptions.As the need for certain functionalities becomes obvious with growing annotation experience  we have decided to implement the tool in two stages.A formalism complying with these requirements is described in section 3.For a description of the annotation tool see section 5.In the first phase  the main functionality for building and displaying unordered trees is supplied.Realworld texts annotated with different strata of linguistic information can be used for grammar induction.Our annotation tool supplies efficient manipulation and immediate visualization of argument structures.Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing.Such a word order independent representation has the advantage of all structural information being encoded in a single data structure.An alternative solution is to make argument structure the main structural component of the formalism.This assumption underlies a growing number of recent syntactic theories which give up the context-free constituent backbone  cf.Corpora annotated with syntactic structures are commonly referred to as trctbank.5.Syntactically annotated corpora of German have been missing until now.
