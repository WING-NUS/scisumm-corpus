We describe a new approach to SMT adaptation that weights out-of-domain phrase pairs according to their relevance to the target domain  determined by both how similar to it they appear to be  and whether they belong to general language or not.Matsoukas et al (2009) generalize it by learning weights on sentence pairs that are used when estimating relative-frequency phrase-pair probabilities.Each out-of-domain phrase pair is characterized by a set of simple features intended to reflect how useful it will be.The sentence-selection approach is crude in that it imposes a binary distinction between useful and non-useful parts of OUT.To approximate these baselines  we implemented a very simple sentence selection algorithm in which parallel sentence pairs from OUT are ranked by the perplexity of their target half according to the IN language model.This extends previous work on discriminative weighting by using a finer granularity  focusing on the properties of instances rather than corpus components  and using a simpler training procedure.Our second contribution is to apply instance weighting at the level of phrase pairs.Daum´e (2007) applies a related idea in a simpler way  by splitting features into general and domain-specific versions.Finally  we intend to explore more sophisticated instanceweighting features for capturing the degree of generality of phrase pairs.First  we learn weights on individual phrase pairs rather than sentences.We incorporate instance weighting into a mixture-model framework  and find that it yields consistent improvements over a wide range of baselines.In both cases  the instanceweighting approach improved over a wide range of baselines  giving gains of over 2 BLEU points over the best non-adapted baseline  and gains of between 0.6 and 1.8 over an equivalent mixture model (with an identical training procedure but without instance weighting).The toplevel weights are trained to maximize a metric such as BLEU on a small development set of approximately 1000 sentence pairs.Domain adaptation is a common concern when optimizing empirical NLP applications.This is a standard adaptation problem for SMT.Realizing gains in practice can be challenging  however  particularly when the target domain is distant from the background data.Sentence pairs are the natural instances for SMT  but sentences often contain a mix of domain-specific and general language.Previous approaches have tried to find examples that are similar to the target domain.Even when there is training data available in the domain of interest  there is often additional data from other domains that could in principle be used to improve performance.However  for multinomial models like our LMs and TMs  there is a one to one correspondence between instances and features  eg the correspondence between a phrase pair (s  t) and its conditional multinomial probability p(s1t).In this paper we study the problem of using a parallel corpus from a background domain (OUT) to improve performance on a target domain (IN) for which a smaller amount of parallel training material—though adequate for reasonable performance—is also available.Thus  provided at least this amount of IN data is available—as it is in our setting—adapting these weights is straightforward.This is less effective in our setting  where IN and OUT are disparate.For developers of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems  an additional complication is the heterogeneous nature of SMT components (word-alignment model  language model  translation model  etc.This highly effective approach is not directly applicable to the multinomial models used for core SMT components  which have no natural method for combining split features  so we rely on an instance-weighting approach (Jiang and Zhai  2007) to downweight domain-specific examples in OUT.)  which precludes a single universal approach to adaptation.In this paper we have proposed an approach for instance-weighting phrase pairs in an out-of-domain corpus in order to improve in-domain performance.The natural baseline approach is to concatenate data from IN and OUT.This is a simple and effective alternative to setting weights discriminatively to maximize a metric such as BLEU.It is difficult when IN and OUT are dissimilar  as they are in the cases we study.When OUT is large and distinct  its contribution can be controlled by training separate IN and OUT models  and weighting their combination.6One of our experimental settings lacks document boundaries  and we used this approximation in both settings for consistency.For simplicity  we assume that OUT is homogeneous.First  we aim to explicitly characterize examples from OUT as belonging to general language or not.The techniques we develop can be extended in a relatively straightforward manner to the more general case when OUT consists of multiple sub-domains.As mentioned above  it is not obvious how to apply Daum´e’s approach to multinomials  which do not have a mechanism for combining split features.This is not unreasonable given the application to phrase pairs from OUT  but it suggests that an interesting alternative might be to use a plain log-linear weighting function exp(Ei Aifi(s  t))  with outputs in [0  oo].This is a straightforward technique that is arguably better suited to the adaptation task than the standard method of treating representative IN sentences as queries  then pooling the match results.There is a fairly large body of work on SMT adaptation.Moving beyond directly related work  major themes in SMT adaptation include the IR (Hildebrand et al.  2005; L¨u et al.  2007; Zhao et al.  2004) and mixture (Finch and Sumita  2008; Foster and Kuhn  2007; Koehn and Schroeder  2007; L¨u et al.  2007) approaches for LMs and TMs described above  as well as methods for exploiting monolingual in-domain text  typically by translating it automatically and then performing self training (Bertoldi and Federico  2009; Ueffing et al.  2007; Schwenk and Senellart  2009).Section 2 describes our baseline techniques for SMT adaptation  and section 3 describes the instance-weighting approach.We introduce several new ideas.We extend the Matsoukas et al approach in several ways.Finally  we make some improvements to baseline approaches.We have not explored this strategy.Figure 1 shows sample sentences from these domains  which are widely divergent.The idea of distinguishing between general and domain-specific examples is due to Daum´e and Marcu (2006)  who used a maximum-entropy model with latent variables to capture the degree of specificity.It is also worth pointing out a connection with Daum´e’s (2007) work that splits each feature into domain-specific and general copies.Jiang and Zhai (2007) suggest the following derivation  making use of the true OUT distribution po(s  t): where each fi(s  t) is a feature intended to charac- !0ˆ =

Manning (2009) which re-casts Daum´e’s approach in a hierarchical MAP framework may be applicable to this problem.
