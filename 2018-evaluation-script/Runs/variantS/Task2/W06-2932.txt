present a two-stage multilingual pendency parser and evaluate it on 13 diverse languages.Nivre (2005) gives an introduction to dependency representations of sentences and recent developments in dependency parsing strategies.It is our hypothesis that for languages with fine-grained label sets  joint parsing and labeling will improve performance.That system uses MIRA  an online large-margin learning algorithm  to compute model parameters.We augmented this model to incorporate morphological features derived from each token.The first stage based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006) augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages.This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006).The results are promising and show the language independence of our system under the assumption of a labeled dependency corpus in the target language.These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework (McDonald et al.  2005b; McDonald and Pereira  2006) is easily adapted across all these languages.For instance  the system of McDonald et al. (2005a) incorporates features over the part of speech of words occurring between and around a possible head-dependent relation.The second stage takes the output from the first and labels all the edges in the dependency graph with appropriate syntactic categories using a globally trained sequence classifier over components of the graph.The first stage of our system creates an unlabeled parse y for an input sentence x.The current system simply includes all morphological bi-gram features.Dependency graphs also encode much of the deep syntactic information needed for further processing.Note that many of these features are beyond the scope of the edge based factorizations of the unlabeled parser.We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et al.  2006) data sets and present an error analysis.We trained models for all 13 languages provided by the CoNLL organizers (Buchholz et al.  2006).We use the MIRA online learner to set the weights (Crammer and Singer  2003; McDonald et al.  2005a) since we found it trained quickly and provide good performance.We evaluate this parser on a diverse set of 13 languages using data provided by the CoNLL-X shared-task organizers (Buchholz et al.  2006; Hajiˇc et al.  2004; Simov et al.  2005; Simov and Osenova  2003; Chen et al.  2003; B¨ohmov´a et al.  2003; Kromann  2003; van der Beek et al.  2002; Brants et al.  2002; Kawata and Bartels  2000; Afonso et al.  2002; Dˇzeroski et al.  2006; Civit Torruella and MartiAntonin  2002; Nilsson et al.  2005; Oflazer et al.  2003; Atalay et al.  2003).Results on the test set are given in Table 1.Often in language processing we require a deep syntactic representation of a sentence in order to assist further processing.Nevertheless  this very preliminary experiment suggests that wider-range features may be useful in improving the recognition of overall sentence structure.Its power lies in the ability to define a rich set of features over parsing decisions  as well as surface level features relative to these decisions.With the availability of resources such as the Penn WSJ Treebank  much of the focus in the parsing community had been on producing syntactic representations based on phrase-structure.However  recently their has been a revived interest in parsing models that produce dependency graph representations of sentences  which model words and their arguments through directed edges (Hudson  1984; Mel'ˇcuk  1988).However  in a two stage system we can incorporate features over the entire output of the unlabeled parser since that structure is fixed as input.This interest has generally come about due to the computationally efficient and flexible nature of dependency graphs and their ability to easily model non-projectivity in freer-word order languages.It is our hope that a better morphological feature set will help with both unlabeled parsing and labeling for highly inflected languages.This has been shown through their successful use in many standard natural language processing tasks  including machine translation (Ding and Palmer  2005)  sentence compression (McDonald  2006)  and textual inference (Haghighi et al.  2005).These features are highly important to overall accuracy since they eliminate unlikely scenarios such as a preposition modifying a noun not directly to its left  or a noun modifying a verb with another verb occurring between them.These features play the obvious role of explicitly modeling consistencies and commonalities between a head and its dependents in terms of attributes like gender  case  or number.However  the parser is fundamentally limited by the scope of local factorizations that make inference tractable.Furthermore  it made the system homogeneous in terms of learning algorithms since that is what is used to train our unlabeled parser (McDonald and Pereira  2006).In this paper we describe a two-stage discriminative parsing approach consisting of an unlabeled parser and a subsequent edge labeler.Note the difference in error between the unlabeled parser and the edge labeler: the former makes mistakes on edges into prepositions  conjunctions and verbs  and the latter makes mistakes on edges into nouns (subject/objects).However  if we only allow projective parses  do not use morphological features and label edges with a simple atomic classifier  the overall drop in performance becomes significant (row 5 versus row 1).First  we plan on examining the performance difference between two-staged dependency parsing (as presented here) and joint parsing plus labeling.Based on performance from a held-out section of the training data  we used non-projective parsing algorithms for Czech  Danish  Dutch  German  Japanese  Portuguese and Slovene  and projective parsing algorithms for Arabic  Bulgarian  Chinese  Spanish  Swedish and Turkish.
