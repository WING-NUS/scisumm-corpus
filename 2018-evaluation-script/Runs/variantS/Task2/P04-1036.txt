word sense disambiguation the heuristic of choosing the most common sense is extremely powerful because the distribution of the senses of a word is often skewed.Most research in WSD concentrates on using contextual features  typically neighbouring words  to help determine the correct sense of a target word.In contrast  our work is aimed at discovering the predominant senses from raw text because the first sense heuristic is such a useful one  and because handtagged data is not always available.To find the first sense of a word ( ) we take each sense in turn and obtain a score reflecting the prevalence which is used for ranking.We use an allwords task because the predominant senses will reflect the sense distributions of all nouns within the documents  rather than a lexical sample task  where the target words are manually determined and the results will depend on the skew of the words in the sample.The problem with using the predominant  or first sense heuristic  aside from the fact that it does not take surrounding context into account  is that it assumes some quantity of handtagged data.There are words where the first sense in WordNet is counter-intuitive  because of the size of the corpus  and because where the frequency data does not indicate a first sense  the ordering is arbitrary.This is to be expected regardless of any inherent shortcomings of the ranking technique since the senses within SemCor will differ compared to those of the BNC.This demonstrates that our method of providing a first sense from raw text will help when sense-tagged data is not available.Whilst there are a few hand-tagged corpora available for some languages  one would expect the frequency distribution of the senses of words  particularly topical words  to depend on the genre and domain of the text under consideration.Whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as SemCor is clearly useful  there is a strong case for obtaining a first  or predominant  sense from untagged corpus data so that a WSD system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.From inspection  one can see that the ordered neighbours of such a thesaurus relate to the different senses of the target word.If WordNet sense distinctions are not ultimately required then discovering the senses directly from the neighbours list is useful because sense distinctions discovered are relevant to the corpus data and new senses can be found.We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically.We use an automatically acquired thesaurus and a WordNet Similarity measure.We have devised a method that uses raw corpus data to automatically find a predominant sense for nouns in WordNet.In order to find the predominant sense of a target word we use a thesaurus acquired from automatically parsed text based on the method of Lin (1998).In contrast  we use the neighbours lists and WordNet similarity measures to impose a prevalence ranking on the WordNet senses.The acquired predominant senses give a of 64% on the nouns of the 2 English all-words task.In the English all-words SENSEVAL-2  25% of the noun data was monosemous.The performance of the predominant sense provided in the SENSEVAL-2 test data provides an upper bound for this task.The random baseline for choosing the predominant sense over all these words ( ) is 32%.The first sense in SemCor provides an upperbound for this task of 67%.This is a very promising result given that our method does not require any hand-tagged text  such as SemCor.We demonstrate that choosing texts from a particular domain has a significant influence on the sense ranking.The high performance of the first sense baseline is due to the skewed frequency distribution of word senses.For these one would need to obtain more sense-tagged text in order to use this heuristic.Furthermore  we demonstrate that our method discovers appropriate predominant senses for words from two domainspecific corpora.We have demonstrated the possibility of finding predominant senses in domain specific corpora on a sample of nouns.We have evaluated our method using publically available resources  both for balanced and domain specific text.The first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised WSD systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account.Even systems which show superior performance to this heuristic often make use of the heuristic where evidence from the context is not sufficient (Hoste et al.  2001).We believe automatic ranking techniques such as ours will be useful for systems that rely on WordNet  for example those that use it for lexical acquisition or WSD.Our automatically acquired predominant sense performs nearly as well as the first sense provided by SemCor  which is very encouraging given that our method only uses raw text  with no manual labelling.This is shown by the results of the English all-words task in SENSEVAL-2 (Cotton et al.  1998) in figure 1 below  where the first sense is that listed in WordNet for the PoS given by the Penn TreeBank (Palmer et al.  2001).We test this below on the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words data.The senses in WordNet are ordered according to the frequency data in the manually tagged resource SemCor (Miller et al.  1993).The automatically acquired predominant senses were evaluated against the hand-tagged resources SemCor and the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task giving us a WSD precision of 64% on an all-nouns task.The results for 10 of the words from the qualitative experiment are summarized in table 3 with the WordNet sense number for each word supplied alongside synonyms or hypernyms from WordNet for readability.We generated a thesaurus entry for all polysemous nouns in WordNet as described in section 2.1 above.We compare results using the first sense listed in SemCor  and the first sense according to the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words test data itself.Senses that have not occurred in SemCor are ordered arbitrarily and after those senses of the word that have occurred.There were a similar number of words that were not covered by a predominant sense in SemCor.The neighbours for a word in a thesaurus are words themselves  rather than senses.Additionally  we need to determine whether senses which do not occur in a wide variety of grammatical contexts fare badly using distributional measures of similarity  and what can be done to combat this problem using relation specific thesauruses.The items that were not covered by our method were those with insufficient grammatical relations for the tuples employed.The figure distinguishes systems which make use of hand-tagged data (using HTD) such as SemCor  from those that do not (without HTD).Lapata and Brew obtain their priors for verb classes directly from subcategorisation evidence in a parsed corpus  whereas we use parsed data to find distributionally similar words (nearest neighbours) to the target word which reflect the different senses of the word and have associated distributional similarity scores which can be used for ranking the senses according to prevalence.The word share is among the words whose predominant sense remained the same for all three corpora.In many cases the sense ranking provided in SemCor differs to that obtained automatically because we used the BNC to produce our thesaurus.We believe that an automatic means of finding a predominant sense would be useful for systems that use it as a means of backing-off (Wilks and Stevenson  1998; Hoste et al.  2001) and for systems that use it in lexical acquisition (McCarthy  1997; Merlo and Leybold  2001; Korhonen  2002) because of the limited size of hand-tagged resources.SemCor comprises a relatively small sample of 250 000 words.The SPORTS corpus consists of 35317 documents (about 9.1 million words).The resulting set consisted of 38 words.The FINANCE corpus consists of 117734 documents (about 32.5 million words).The jcn measure uses corpus data for the calculation of IC.Even given the difference in text type between SemCor and the BNC the results are encouraging  especially given that our results are for polysemous nouns.
