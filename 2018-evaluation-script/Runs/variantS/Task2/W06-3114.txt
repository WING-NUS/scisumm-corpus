from 2.33 to 3.67  the average adequacy judgement ranged from 2.56 to 4.13.For some language pairs (such as GermanEnglish) system performance is more divergent than for others (such as English-French)  at least as measured by BLEU.The judgement of 4 in the first case will go to a vastly better system output than in the second case.was done by the participants.Participants and other volunteers contributed about 180 hours of labor in the manual evaluation.About half of the participants of last year’s shared task participated again.Judges where excluded from assessing the quality of MT systems that were submitted by their institution.Annotators argued for the importance of having correct and even multiple references.This revealed interesting clues about the properties of automatic and manual scoring.This data set of manual judgements should provide a fruitful resource for research on better automatic scoring methods.Human judges also pointed out difficulties with the evaluation of long sentences.Again  we can compute average scores for all systems for the different language pairs (Figure 6).• We evaluated translation from English  in addition to into English.English was again paired with German  French  and Spanish.The predominate focus of building systems that translate into English has ignored so far the difficult issues of generating rich morphology which may not be determined solely by local context.We carried out an extensive manual and automatic evaluation of machine translation performance on European language pairs.A few annotators suggested to break up long sentences into clauses and evaluate these separately.Not every annotator was fluent in both the source and the target language.Sentences and systems were randomly selected and randomly shuffled for presentation.We dropped  however  one of the languages  Finnish  partly to keep the number of tracks manageable  partly because we assumed that it would be hard to find enough Finnish speakers for the manual evaluation.However  ince we extracted the test corpus automatically from web sources  the reference translation was not always accurate — due to sentence alignment errors  or because translators did not adhere to a strict sentence-by-sentence translation (say  using pronouns when referring to entities mentioned in the previous sentence).In this shared task  we were also confronted with this problem  and since we had no funding for paying human judgements  we asked participants in the evaluation to share the burden.Because of this  we retokenized and lowercased submitted output with our own tokenizer  which was also used to prepare the training and test data.We can check  what the consequences of less manual annotation of results would have been: With half the number of manual judgements  we can distinguish about 40% of the systems  10% less.The evaluation framework for the shared task is similar to the one used in last year’s shared task.We are therefore applying a different method  which has been used at the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.Compared to last year’s shared task  the participants represent more long-term research efforts.Systran submitted their commercial rule-based system that was not tuned to the Europarl corpus.Training and testing is based on the Europarl corpus.The out-of-domain test set differs from the Europarl data in various ways.Figure 1 provides some statistics about this corpus.For statistics on this test set  refer to Figure 1.In Figure 4  we displayed the number of system comparisons  for which we concluded statistical significance.To lower the barrier of entrance to the competition  we provided a complete baseline MT system  along with data resources.Since all long sentence translation are somewhat muddled  even a contrastive evaluation between systems was difficult.To summarize  we provided: The performance of the baseline system is similar to the best submissions in last year’s shared task.In-domain Systran scores on this metric are lower than all statistical systems  even the ones that have much worse human scores.This is less than the 694 judgements 2004 DARPA/NIST evaluation  or the 532 judgements in the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.The statistical systems seem to still lag behind the commercial rule-based competition when translating into morphological rich languages  as demonstrated by the results for English-German and English-French.We are currently working on a complete open source implementation of a training and decoding system  which should become available over the summer. pus  from which also the in-domain test set is taken.While building a machine translation system is a serious undertaking  in future we hope to attract more newcomers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry as low as possible.At the very least  we are creating a data resource (the manual annotations) that may the basis of future research in evaluation metrics.While we had up to 11 submissions for a translation direction  we did decide against presenting all 11 system outputs to the human judge.It was our hope that this competition  which included the manual and automatic evaluation of statistical systems and one rulebased commercial system  will give further insight into the relation between automatic and manual evaluation.There is twice as much language modelling data  since training data for the machine translation system is filtered against sentences of length larger than 40 words.We divide up each test set into blocks of 20 sentences (100 blocks for the in-domain test set  53 blocks for the out-of-domain test set)  check for each block  if one system has a higher BLEU score than the other  and then use the sign test.For instance  in the recent IWSLT evaluation  first fluency annotations were solicited (while withholding the source sentence)  and then adequacy annotations.Out-of-domain test data is from the Project Syndicate web site  a compendium of political commentary.Surprisingly  this effect is much less obvious for out-of-domain test data.In addition to the Europarl test set  we also collected 29 editorials from the Project Syndicate website2  which are published in all the four languages of the shared task.The test data was again drawn from a segment of the Europarl corpus from the fourth quarter of 2000  which is excluded from the training data.The test set included 2000 sentences from the Europarl corpus  but also 1064 sentences out-ofdomain test data.Participants were also provided with two sets of 2 000 sentences of parallel text to be used for system development and tuning.We settled on contrastive evaluations of 5 system outputs for a single test sentence.We aligned the texts at a sentence level across all four languages  resulting in 1064 sentence per language.
