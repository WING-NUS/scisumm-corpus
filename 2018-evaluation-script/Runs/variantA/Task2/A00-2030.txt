Although mathematically the model predicts tree elements in a top-down fashion  we search the space bottom-up using a chartbased search.Figure 4 shows an example of the semantic annotation  which was the only type of manual annotation we performed.In this paper  we report adapting a lexicalized  probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFG-HR) to information extraction.Several technical challenges confronted us and were solved: TREEBANK on Wall Street Journal adequately train the algorithm for New York Times newswire  which includes dozens of newspapers?Instead  we applied an information retrieval system to select a large number of articles from the desired sources  yielding a corpus rich in the desired types of events.We were already using a generative statistical model for part-of-speech tagging (Weischedel et al. 1993)  and more recently  had begun using a generative statistical model for name finding (Bikel et al.Given multiple constituents that cover identical spans in the chart  only those constituents with probabilities within a While our focus throughout the project was on TE and TR  we became curious about how well the model did at part-of-speech tagging  syntactic parsing  and at name finding.Finally  word features  fm  for modifiers are predicted based on the modifier  cm  the partof-speech tag of the modifier word   t„„ the part-of-speech tag of the head word th  the head word itself  wh  and whether or not the modifier head word  w„„ is known or unknown.The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies  either expressed or implied  of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or the United States Government.Currently  the prevailing architecture for dividing sentential processing is a four-stage pipeline consisting of: Since we were interested in exploiting recent advances in parsing  replacing the syntactic analysis stage of the standard pipeline with a modern statistical parser was an obvious possibility.Thus  we did not consider simply adding semantic labels to the existing Penn TREEBANK  which is drawn from a single source — the Wall Street Journal — and is impoverished in articles about rocket launches.Nearly all of the work was done by the sentential model; disabling the cross-sentence model entirely reduced our overall F-Score by only 2 points.However  because these estimates are too sparse to be relied upon  we use interpolated estimates consisting of mixtures of successively lowerorder estimates (as in Placeway et al. 1993).For example  an error made during part-of-speech-tagging may cause a future error in syntactic analysis  which may in turn cause a semantic interpretation failure.Almost all approaches to information extraction — even at the sentence level — are based on the divide-and-conquer strategy of reducing a complex problem to a set of simpler ones.For this reason  we focused on designing an integrated model in which tagging  namefinding  parsing  and semantic interpretation decisions all have the opportunity to mutually influence each other.The five key facts in this example are: Here  each &quot;reportable&quot; name or description is identified by a &quot;-r&quot; suffix attached to its semantic label.We evaluated the new approach to information extraction on two of the tasks of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) and reported in (Marsh  1998).Since 1995  a few statistical parsing algorithms have demonstrated a breakthrough in parsing accuracy  as measured against the UPenn TREEBANK as a gold standard.The technique was benchmarked in the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) in 1998.We have demonstrated  at least for one problem  that a lexicalized  probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFGHR) can be used effectively for information extraction.Word features are introduced primarily to help with unknown words  as in (Weischedel et al. 1993).In this paper we report adapting a lexic al ized  probabilistic context-free parser to information extraction and evaluate this new technique on MUC-7 template elements and template relations.At each step in the process  a choice is made from a statistical distribution  with the probability of each possible selection dependent on particular features of previously generated elements.Although each model differed in its detailed probability structure  we believed that the essential elements of all three models could be generalized in a single probability model.The detailed probability structure differs  however  in that it was designed to jointly perform part-of-speech tagging  name finding  syntactic parsing  and relation finding in a single process.Our integrated model represents syntax and semantics jointly using augmented parse trees.In this section  we describe the algorithm that was used to automatically produce augmented trees  starting with a) human-generated semantic annotations and b) machinegenerated syntactic parse trees.Chiba  (1999) was able to use such a parsing algorithm to reduce perplexity with the long term goal of improved speech recognition.To produce a corpus of augmented parse trees  we used the following multi-step training procedure which exploited the Penn TREEBANK Applying this procedure yielded a new version of the semantically annotated corpus  now annotated with complete augmented trees like that in Figure 3.Finally  our newly constructed parser  like that of (Collins 1997)  was based on a generative statistical model.For the following example  the The Template Relations (TR) task involves identifying instances of three relations in the text: TR builds on TE in that TR reports binary relations between elements of TE.For example  the coreference relation between &quot;Nance&quot; and &quot;a paid consultant to ABC News&quot; is indicated by &quot;per-desc-of.&quot; In this case  because the argument does not connect directly to the relation  the intervening nodes are labeled with semantics &quot;-ptr&quot; to indicate the connection.Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages  we were optimistic that some of their properties — especially their ability to learn from large amounts of data  and their robustness when presented with unexpected inputs — would also benefit semantic analysis.We evaluated part-of-speech tagging and parsing accuracy on the Wall Street Journal using a now standard procedure (see Collins 97)  and evaluated name finding accuracy on the MUC7 named entity test.Technical agents for part of this work were Fort Huachucha and AFRL under contract numbers DABT63-94-C-0062  F30602-97-C-0096  and 4132-BBN-001.Our annotation staff found syntactic analysis particularly complex and slow going.
