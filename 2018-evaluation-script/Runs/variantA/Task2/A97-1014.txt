In addition  we have adopted a simple convention for those cases in which context information is insufficient  for total disambiguation: the highest possible attachment  site is chosen.Since a precise structural description of non-constituent coordination would require a. rich inventory of incomplete phrase types  we have agreed on a sort of unde.rspe.cified representations: the coordinated units are assigned structures in which missing lexical material is not represented at the level of primary links.In the following paragraphs  we give annotations for a number of such phenomena..As the annotation scheme described in this paper focusses on annotating argument structure rather than constituent trees  it differs from existing treebanks in several aspects.A formalism complying with these requirements is described in section 3.For the implementation  we used Tcl/Tk Version 4.1.Moreover  the so-called DP analysis views the article der as the head of the phrase.For a description of the annotation tool see section 5.In section 2  we examine the appropriateness of existing annotation schemes.In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30 000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created.In the first phase  the main functionality for building and displaying unordered trees is supplied.The typical treebank architecture is as follows: Structures: A context-free backbone is augmented with trace-filler representations of non-local dependencies.A tree meeting these requirements is given below: Adv V NP NP V CPL NP V damn wird ihn Anna erkennen  dais er 'vein!As the annotation scheme does not distinguish different bar levels or any similar intermediate categories  only a small set of node labels is needed (currently 16 tags  S  NP  AP ...).During annotation  the highest rated grammatical function labels Gi are calculated using the Viterbi algorithm and assigned to the structure  i.e.  we calculate argma.x11 PQ (Ti 1Z-1  Ti.-2) PQ (Gi ITi).For a phrase Q with children of type T„...  Ta and grammatical functions G„... GA.  we use the lexical probabilities and the contextual (trigram) probabilities The lexical and contextual probabilities are determined separately for each type of phrase.If the scope of such a word does not directly correspond to a tree node  the word is attached to the lowest node dominating all subconstituents appearing in its scope.Treebanks of the format  described in the above section have been designed for English.These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme.As the need for certain functionalities becomes obvious with growing annotation experience  we have decided to implement the tool in two stages.As theory-independence is one of our objectives  the annotation scheme incorporates a number of widely accepted linguistic analyses  especially in the area of verbal  adverbial and adjectival syntax.While in the first phase each annotator has to annotate structures as well as categories and functions  the refinement call be done separately for each representation level.As already mentioned  this is done separately for each of the three information areas.Furthermore  the required theory-independence means that the form of syntactic trees should not reflect theory-specific assumptions  e.g. every syntactic structure has a unique head.The resulting scheme reflects a stratificational notion of language  and makes only minimal assumpabout the interrelation of the particu- •lar representational strata.Multi-stratal representation: Clear separation of different description levels is desirable.In (5)  either a lexical nominalisation rule for the adjective Gliickliche is stipulated  or the existence of an empty nominal head.In order to avoid inconsistencies  the corpus is annotated in two stages: basic annotation and nfirtellte714.In general  the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories.Such a word order independent representation has the advantage of all structural information being encoded in a single data structure.Due to the frequency of discontinuous constituents in non-configurational languages  the filler-trace mechanism would be used very often  yielding syntactic trees fairly different from the underlying predicate-argument structures.The corpus is stored in a SQL database.In addition the approach provides empirical material for psycholinguistic investigation  since preferences for the choice of certain syntactic constructions  linea.rizations  and attachments that have been observed in online experiments of language production and comprehension can now be put in relation with the frequency of these alternatives in larger amounts of texts.This work is part of the DFG Sonderforschungsbereich 378 Rcsource-Adaptim Cogniiivc Proccsses  We wish to thank Tania Avgustinova  Berthold Crysmann  Lars Konieczny  Stephan Oepen  Karel Oliva.  Christian Weil3 and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on the content of this paper.3 shows the representation of the sentence: (6) sic wurde von preuBischen Truppen besetzt she was by Prussian troops occupied und 1887 dem preuliischen Staat angegliedert and 1887 to-the Prussian state incorporated 'it was occupied by Prussian troops and incorporated into Prussia in 1887' The category of the coordination is labeled CVP here  where C stands for coordination  and VP for the actual category.During the first phase  the focus is on annotating correct structures and a coarse-grained classification of grammatical functions  which represent the following areas of information: Dependency type: complements are further classified according to features such as category and case: clausal complements (OC)  accusative objects (OA)  datives (DA)  etc.(2) schade  daB kein Arzt anwesend ist  der pity that no doctor present is who sich a.uskennt is competent 'Pity that no competent doctor is here' Note that the root node does not have a head descendant (HD) as the sentence is a predicative construction consisting of a subject (SB) and a predicate (PD) without a copula.Consider the German sentence (1) daran wird ihn Anna erkennen  &di er weint at-it will him Anna recognise that he cries 'Anna will recognise him at his cry' A sample constituent structure is given below: The fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies  marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes.
