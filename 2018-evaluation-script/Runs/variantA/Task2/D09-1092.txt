Finally  for each pair of languages (“query” and “target”) we calculate the difference between the topic distribution for each held-out document in the query language and the topic distribution for each held-out document in the target language.They find  for example  that English blog posts about the Nintendo Wii often relate to a hack  which cannot be mentioned in Japanese posts due to Japanese intellectual property law.Continuing with the example above  one might extract a set of connected Wikipedia articles related to the focus of the journal and then train PLTM on a joint corpus consisting of journal papers and Wikipedia articles.Finally  historical topics  such as the Byzantine and Ottoman empires (right) are strong in all languages  but show geographical variation: interest centers around the empires.Restricting the query/target pairs to only those with query and target documents that are both longer than 50 words results in significant improvement and reduced variance: the average proportion of query documents for which the true translation is ranked highest goes from 53.9% to 72.7%.Topic models have been used for analyzing topic trends in research literature (Mann et al.  2006; Hall et al.  2008)  inferring captions for images (Blei and Jordan  2003)  social network analysis in email (McCallum et al.  2005)  and expanding queries with topically related words in information retrieval (Wei and Croft  2006).We also do not count morphological variants: the model finds EN “rules” and DE “vorschriften ” but the lexicon contains only “rule” and “vorschrift.” Results remain strong as we increase K. With K = 3  T = 800  1349 of the 7200 candidate pairs for Spanish appeared in the lexicon. topic in different languages translations of each other?We downloaded XML copies of all Wikipedia articles in twelve different languages: Welsh  German  Greek  English  Farsi  Finnish  French  Hebrew  Italian  Polish  Russian and Turkish.Second  because comparable texts may not use exactly the same topics  it becomes crucially important to be able to characterize differences in topic prevalence at the document level (do different languages have different perspectives on the same article?) and at the language-wide level (which topics do particular languages focus on?).The EuroParl corpus consists of parallel texts in eleven western European languages: Danish  German  Greek  English  Spanish  Finnish  French  Italian  Dutch  Portuguese and Swedish.We therefore evaluate the ability of the PLTM to generate bilingual lexica  similar to other work in unsupervised translation modeling (Haghighi et al.  2008).We demonstrate its utility and explore its characteristics using two polylingual corpora: proceedings of the European parliament (in eleven languages) and a collection of Wikipedia articles (in twelve languages).We employ a set of direct translations  the EuroParl corpus  to evaluate whether PLTM can accurately infer topics when documents genuinely contain the same content.Results for K = 1  that is  considering only the single most probable word for each language  are shown in figure 6.To evaluate this scenario  we train PLTM on a set of document tuples from EuroParl  infer topic distributions for a set of held-out documents  and then measure our ability to align documents in one language with their translations in another language.When applied to comparable document collections such as Wikipedia  PLTM supports data-driven analysis of differences and similarities across all languages for readers who understand any one language.The polylingual topic model (PLTM) is an extension of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al.  2003) for modeling polylingual document tuples.We introduced a polylingual topic model (PLTM) that discovers topics aligned across multiple languages.Bilingual topic models for parallel texts with word-to-word alignments have been studied previously using the HM-bitam model (Zhao and Xing  2007).These versions of Wikipedia were selected to provide a diverse range of language families  geographic areas  and quantities of text.For every topic t we select a small number K of the most probable words in English (e) and in each “translation” language (E): Wte and Wtt  respectively.Although direct translations in multiple languages are relatively rare (in contrast with comparable documents)  we use direct translations to explore the characteristics of the model.Given a corpus of training and test document tuples—W and W'  respectively—two possible inference tasks of interest are: computing the probability of the test tuples given the training tuples and inferring latent topic assignments for test documents.Smoothed histograms of inter−language JS divergence A topic model specifies a probability distribution over documents  or in the case of PLTM  document tuples.It is important to note  however  that these results do not imply that LDA should be preferred over PLTM—that choice depends upon the needs of the modeler.This result is important: informally  we have found that increasing the granularity of topics correlates strongly with user perceptions of the utility of a topic model.Precision at this level is relatively high  above 50% for Spanish  French and Italian with T = 400 and 800.Interestingly  we find that almost all languages in our corpus  including several pairs that have historically been in conflict  show average JS divergences of between approximately 0.08 and 0.12 for T = 400  consistent with our findings for EuroParl translations.Each tuple is a set of documents that are loosely equivalent to each other  but written in different languages  e.g.  corresponding Wikipedia articles in French  English and German.Polylingual Topic ModelsWe evaluate sets of high-probability words in each topic and multilingual “synsets” by comparing them to entries in human-constructed bilingual dictionaries  as done by Haghighi et al. (2008).Additionally  PLTM can support the creation of bilingual lexica for low resource language pairs  providing candidate translations for more computationally intense alignment processes without the sentence-aligned translations typically used in such tasks.We analyzed the characteristics of PLTM in comparison to monolingual LDA  and demonstrated that it is possible to discover aligned topics.We take a simpler approach that is more suitable for topically similar document tuples (where documents are not direct translations of one another) in more than two languages.We introduce a polylingual topic model that discovers topics aligned across multiple languages.As with the previous figure  there are a small number of documents that contain only one topic in all languages  and thus have zero divergence.Although the model does not distinguish between topic assignment variables within a given document tuple (so it is technically incorrect to speak of different posterior distributions over topics for different documents in a given tuple)  we can nevertheless divide topic assignment variables between languages and use them to estimate a Dirichlet-multinomial posterior distribution for each language in each tuple.Additionally  PLTM assumes that each “topic” consists of a set of discrete distributions over words—one for each language l = 1  ...   L. In other words  rather than using a single set of topics Φ = {φ1  ...   φT}  as in LDA  there are L sets of language-specific topics  Φ1  ...   ΦL  each of which is drawn from a language-specific symmetric Dirichlet with concentration parameter βl.Additionally  the predictive ability of PLTM is consistently slightly worse than that of (monolingual) LDA.Given a set of training document tuples  PLTM can be used to obtain posterior estimates of Φ'  ...   ΦL and αm.For each tuple we can then calculate the JensenShannon divergence (the average of the KL divergences between each distribution and a mean distribution) between these distributions.We calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the topic distributions for each pair of individual documents in S that were originally part of the same tuple prior to separation.Maximum topic probability in document Although the posterior distribution over topics for each tuple is not concentrated on one topic  it is worth checking that this is not simply because the model is assigning a single topic to the 1We use the R density function. tokens in each of the languages.As with EuroParl  we can calculate the JensenShannon divergence between pairs of documents within a comparable document tuple.We collected bilingual lexica mapping English words to German  Greek  Spanish  French  Italian  Dutch and Swedish.In the early statistical translation model work at IBM  these representations were called “cepts ” short for concepts (Brown et al.  1993).A recent extended abstract  developed concurrently by Ni et al. (Ni et al.  2009)  discusses a multilingual topic model similar to the one presented here.We argue that topic modeling is both a useful and appropriate tool for leveraging correspondences between semantically comparable documents in multiple different languages.Outside of the field of topic modeling  Kawaba et al. (Kawaba et al.  2008) use a Wikipedia-based model to perform sentiment analysis of blog posts.Although we find that if Wikipedia contains an article on a particular subject in some language  the article will tend to be topically similar to the articles about that subject in other languages  we also find that across the whole collection different languages emphasize topics to different extents.To perform topic-based bibliometric analysis on these collections  it is necessary to have topic models that are aligned across languages.An important application for polylingual topic modeling is to use small numbers of comparable document tuples to link topics in larger collections of distinct  non-comparable documents in multiple languages.By linking topics across languages  polylingual topic models can increase cross-cultural understanding by providing readers with the ability to characterize the contents of collections in unfamiliar languages and identify trends in topic prevalence.
