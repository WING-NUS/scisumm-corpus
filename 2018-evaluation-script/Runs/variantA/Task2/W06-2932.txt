Each stage by itself is relatively accurate (unlabeled accuracy is 79% and labeling accuracy3 is also 79%)  but since there is very little overlap in the kinds of errors each makes  overall labeled accuracy drops to 67%.Clearly adding more data is improving performance.An exact projective and an approximate non-projective parsing algorithm are presented  since it is shown that nonprojective dependency parsing becomes NP-hard when features are extended beyond a single edge.For score functions  we use simple dot products between high dimensional feature representations and a weight vector Assuming we have an appropriate feature representation  we can find the highest scoring label sequence with Viterbi’s algorithm.The simplest labeler would be to take as input an edge (i  j) E y for sentence x and find the label with highest score  Doing this for each edge in the tree would produce the final output.Table 2 shows that each component of our system does not change performance significantly (rows 24 versus row 1).Results on the test set are given in Table 1.Note that many of these features are beyond the scope of the edge based factorizations of the unlabeled parser.A quick look at unlabeled attachment accuracies indicate that errors in Arabic parsing are the most common across all languages: prepositions (62%)  conjunctions (69%) and to a lesser extent verbs (73%).For instance  the system of McDonald et al. (2005a) incorporates features over the part of speech of words occurring between and around a possible head-dependent relation.However  recently their has been a revived interest in parsing models that produce dependency graph representations of sentences  which model words and their arguments through directed edges (Hudson  1984; Mel'ˇcuk  1988).Furthermore  it made the system homogeneous in terms of learning algorithms since that is what is used to train our unlabeled parser (McDonald and Pereira  2006).This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006).Furthermore  for Arabic and Spanish  we used lemmas instead of inflected word forms  again based on performance on held-out data1.We Proceedings of the 10th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-X)  pages 216–220  New York City  June 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics assume that all dependency graphs are trees but may be non-projective  both of which are true in the data sets we use.To model this we treat the labeling of the edges (i  j1)  ...   (i  jM) as a sequence labeling problem  We use a first-order Markov factorization of the score s(l(i jm)  l(i jm�1)  i  y  x) in which each factor is the score of labeling the adjacent edges (i  jm) and (i  jm−1) in the tree y.We evaluate this parser on a diverse set of 13 languages using data provided by the CoNLL-X shared-task organizers (Buchholz et al.  2006; Hajiˇc et al.  2004; Simov et al.  2005; Simov and Osenova  2003; Chen et al.  2003; B¨ohmov´a et al.  2003; Kromann  2003; van der Beek et al.  2002; Brants et al.  2002; Kawata and Bartels  2000; Afonso et al.  2002; Dˇzeroski et al.  2006; Civit Torruella and MartiAntonin  2002; Nilsson et al.  2005; Oflazer et al.  2003; Atalay et al.  2003).Based on performance from a held-out section of the training data  we used non-projective parsing algorithms for Czech  Danish  Dutch  German  Japanese  Portuguese and Slovene  and projective parsing algorithms for Arabic  Bulgarian  Chinese  Spanish  Swedish and Turkish.For instance  sequential labeling improves the labeling of 2This difference was much larger for experiments in which gold standard unlabeled dependencies are used. objects from 81.7%/75.6% to 84.2%/81.3% (labeled precision/recall) and the labeling of subjects from 86.8%/88.2% to 90.5%/90.4% for Swedish.Nivre (2005) gives an introduction to dependency representations of sentences and recent developments in dependency parsing strategies.Furthermore  these results show that a twostage system can achieve a relatively high performance.We attempted higher-order Markov factorizations but they did not improve performance uniformly across languages and training became significantly slower.In fact  for every language our models perform significantly higher than the average performance for all the systems reported in Buchholz et al. (2006).This is not surprising since these edge labels typically are the most correlated (i.e.  if you already know which noun dependent is the subject  then it should be easy to find the object).For example  in the test sentence Lo que decia Mae West de si misma podriamos decirlo tambi´en los hombres:...  decia’s head is given as decirlo  although the main verbs of relative clauses are normally dependent on what the relative modifies  in this case the article Lo.In this paper we describe a two-stage discriminative parsing approach consisting of an unlabeled parser and a subsequent edge labeler.For instance  if we consider a head xi with dependents xj1  ...   xjM  it is often the case that many of these dependencies will have correlated labels.We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al. (McDonald et al.  2005b; McDonald and Pereira  2006) generalizes well to languages other than English.
