Recently  combination techniques have been investigated for part of speech tagging with positive results (van Halteren et al.  1998; Brill and Wu  1998).Through parser combination we have reduced the precision error rate by 30% and the recall error rate by 6% compared to the best previously published result.The machine learning community has been in a similar situation and has studied the combination of multiple classifiers (Wolpert  1992; Heath et al.  1996).All four of the techniques studied result in parsing systems that perform better than any previously reported.Similar advances have been made in machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg  1994)  speech recognition (Fiscus  1997) and named entity recognition (Borthwick et al.  1998).In Equations 1 through 3 we develop the model for constructing our parse using naïve Bayes classification.• Similarly  when the naïve Bayes classifier is configured such that the constituents require estimated probabilities strictly larger than 0.5 to be accepted  there is not enough probability mass remaining on crossing brackets for them to be included in the hypothesis.These three parsers have given the best reported parsing results on the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al.  1993).IL+-1Proof: Assume a pair of crossing constituents appears in the output of the constituent voting technique using k parsers.This is equivalent to the assumption used in probability estimation for naïve Bayes classifiers  namely that the attribute values are conditionally independent when the target value is given.The precision and recall measures (described in more detail in Section 3) used in evaluating Treebank parsing treat each constituent as a separate entity  a minimal unit of correctness.Under certain conditions the constituent voting and naïve Bayes constituent combination techniques are guaranteed to produce sets of constituents with no crossing brackets.Lemma: If the number of votes required by constituent voting is greater than half of the parsers under consideration the resulting structure has no crossing constituents.It is chosen such that the decisions it made in including or excluding constituents are most probable under the models for all of the parsers.The difference in precision between similarity and Bayes switching techniques is significant  but the difference in recall is not.Ties are rare in Bayes switching because the models are fine-grained — many estimated probabilities are involved in each decision.This is the first set that gives us a fair evaluation of the Bayes models  and the Bayes switching model performs significantly better than its non-parametric counterpart.The precision and recall of similarity switching and constituent voting are both significantly better than the best individual parser  and constituent voting is significantly better than parser switching in precision.4 Constituent voting gives the highest accuracy for parsing the Penn Treebank reported to date.This technique has the advantage of requiring no training  but it has the disadvantage of treating all parsers equally even though they may have differing accuracies or may specialize in modeling different phenomena.The three parsers were trained and tuned by their creators on various sections of the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank  leaving only sections 22 and 23 completely untouched during the development of any of the parsers.Their theoretical finding is simply stated: classification error rate decreases toward the noise rate exponentially in the number of independent  accurate classifiers.Another way to interpret this is that less than 5% of the correct constituents are missing from the hypotheses generated by the union of the three parsers.Table 4 shows how much the Bayes switching technique uses each of the parsers on the test set.Furthermore  we know one of the original parses will be the hypothesized parse  so the direct method of determining which one is best is to compute the probability of each of the candidate parses using the probabilistic model we developed in Section 2.1.We have presented two general approaches to studying parser combination: parser switching and parse hybridization.The constituent voting and naïve Bayes techniques are equivalent because the parameters learned in the training set did not sufficiently discriminate between the three parsers.In this case we are interested in finding' the maximum probability parse  ri  and Mi is the set of relevant (binary) parsing decisions made by parser i. ri is a parse selected from among the outputs of the individual parsers.
