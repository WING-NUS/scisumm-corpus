<S sid="21" ssid="17">Central in these models is the notion of compositionality &#8212; the meaning of complex expressions is determined by the meanings of their constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them.</S>
<S sid="27" ssid="23">Our results show that the multiplicative models are superior and correlate significantly with behavioral data.</S>
<S sid="189" ssid="1">In this paper we presented a general framework for vector-based semantic composition.</S
<S sid="53" ssid="1">We formulate semantic composition as a function of two vectors, u and v. We assume that individual words are represented by vectors acquired from a corpus following any of the parametrisations that have been suggested in the literature.1 We briefly note here that a word&#8217;s vector typically represents its co-occurrence with neighboring words.</S>
<S sid="76" ssid="24">The models considered so far assume that components do not &#8216;interfere&#8217; with each other, i.e., that It is also possible to re-introduce the dependence on K into the model of vector composition.</S>
<S sid="57" ssid="5">Let p denote the composition of two vectors u and v, representing a pair of constituents which stand in some syntactic relation R. Let K stand for any additional knowledge or information which is needed to construct the semantics of their composition.</S>
<S sid="190" ssid="2">We formulated composition as a function of two vectors and introduced several models based on addition and multiplication.</S>
<S sid="60" ssid="8">To derive specific models from this general framework requires the identification of appropriate constraints to narrow the space of functions being considered.</S>
<S sid="73" ssid="21">Relaxing the assumption of symmetry in the case of the simple additive model produces a model which weighs the contribution of the two components differently: This allows additive models to become more syntax aware, since semantically important constituents can participate more actively in the composition.</S>
<S sid="99" ssid="12">In order to establish an independent measure of sentence similarity, we assembled a set of experimental materials and elicited similarity ratings from human subjects.</S>
<S sid="191" ssid="3">Despite the popularity of additive models, our experimental results showed the superiority of models utilizing multiplicative combinations, at least for the sentence similarity task attempted here.</S>
