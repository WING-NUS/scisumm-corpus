A maximum-entropy-inspired parser is a novel approach for parsing.the authors propose to improve the accuracy of parsing by employing probablistic generative method.The parser is inspired by maximum-entropy model for conditioning and smoothing.Feature sets are used for conditioning and deleted interpolation method is used for smoothing.the model uses a Markov-grammar approach.The lexicalized Markov grammar parsing model achieves an average accuracy of 91.1% on sentences of length less than or equal to 40 and 89.5% on sentences of length less than or equal to 100 which corresponds to an error reduction of 13%.the major achievement along with the accuracy is the strategy of guessing pre-terminal before guessing head,it improved the performance by 2%.This suggests that the flexibility offered by maximum-entropy model may give better results in future if conditioned with different grammars.
